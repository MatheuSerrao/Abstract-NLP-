9601591,Research on Cybersecurity Strategy and Key Technology of the Wind Farms’ Industrial Control System,"Affected by the inherent ideas like ""Focus on Function Realization, Despise Security Protection"", there are lots of hidden threats in the industrial control system of wind farms (ICS-WF), such as unreasonable IP configuration, failure in virus detection and killing, which are prone to illegal invasion and attack from the cyberspace. Those unexpected unauthorized accesses are quite harmful for the stable operation of the wind farms and regional power grid. Therefore, by investigating the current security situation and needs of ICS-WF, analyzing the characteristics of ICS-WF’s architecture and internal communication, and integrating the ideas of the classified protection of cybersecurity, this paper proposes a new customized cybersecurity strategy for ICS-WF based on the barrel theory. We also introduce an new anomalous intrusion detection technology for ICS-WF, which is developed based on statistical models of wind farm network characteristics. Finally, combined all these work with the network security offense and defense drill in the industrial control safety simulation laboratory of wind farms, this research formulates a three-dimensional comprehensive protection solution for ICS-WF, which significantly improves the cybersecurity level of ICS-WF."
9579290,CyberEyes: Cybersecurity Entity Recognition Model Based on Graph Convolutional Network,"Cybersecurity has gradually become the public focus between common people and countries with the high development of Internet technology in daily life. The cybersecurity knowledge analysis methods have achieved high evolution with the help of knowledge graph technology, especially a lot of threat intelligence information could be extracted with fine granularity. But named entity recognition (NER) is the primary task for constructing security knowledge graph. Traditional NER models are difficult to determine entities that have a complex structure in the field of cybersecurity, and it is difficult to capture non-local and non-sequential dependencies. In this paper, we propose a cybersecurity entity recognition model CyberEyes that uses non-local dependencies extracted by graph convolutional neural networks. The model can capture both local context and graph-level non-local dependencies. In the evaluation experiments, our model reached an F1 score of 90.28% on the cybersecurity corpus under the gold evaluation standard for NER, which performed better than the 86.49% obtained by the classic CNN-BiLSTM-CRF model."

9483736,Managing Cybersecurity Risk Using Threat Based Methodology for Evaluation of Cybersecurity Architectures,"To manage limited resources available to protect against cybersecurity threats, organizations must use risk management approach to prioritize investments in protection capabilities. Currently, there is no commonly accepted methodology for cybersecurity professionals that considers one of the key elements of risk function – threat landscape – to identify gaps (blinds spots) where cybersecurity protections do not exist and where future investments are needed. This paper discusses a new, threat-based approach for evaluation of cybersecurity architectures that allows organizations to look at their cybersecurity protections from the standpoint of an adversary. The approach is based on a methodology developed by the Department of Defense and further expanded by the Department of Homeland Security. The threat-based approach uses a cyber threat framework to enumerate all threat actions previously observed in the wild and scores protections (cybersecurity architectural capabilities) against each threat action for their ability to: a) detect; b) protect against; and c) help in recovery from the threat action. The answers form a matrix called capability coverage map – a visual representation of protections coverage, gaps, and overlaps against threats. To allow for prioritization, threat actions can be organized in a threat heat map – a visual representation of threat actions’ prevalence and maneuverability that can be overlaid on top of a coverage map. The paper demonstrates a new threat modeling methodology and recommends future research to establish a decision-making framework for designing cybersecurity architectures (capability portfolios) that maximize protections (described as coverage in terms of protect, detect, and respond functions) against known cybersecurity threats."
9469727,"Framework, Tools and Good Practices for Cybersecurity Curricula","Cybersecurity education and training are essential prerequisites of achieving a secure and privacy-friendly digital environment. Both professionals and the general public widely acknowledge the need for high-quality university education programs and professional training courses. However, guides, recommendations, practical tools, and good examples that could help institutions design appropriate cybersecurity programs are still missing. In particular, a comprehensive method to identify skills needed by cybersecurity work roles offered on the job market is missing. This paper aims to provide practical tools and strategies to help higher education providers design good cybersecurity curricula. First, we analyze the content of 89 existing study programs worldwide, collect recommendations of renowned institutions within and outside the EU, and provide a comprehensive survey accompanied by a dynamic web application called Education Map. Based on the knowledge about the current state in cybersecurity education, we design the SPARTA Cybersecurity Skills Framework that provides the currently missing link between work roles and required expertise and shows how to develop a curriculum that reflects job market requirements. Finally, we provide a practical tool that implements the framework and helps education and training providers design new study programs and analyze existing ones by considering the requirements of cybersecurity work roles."

8823310,Cybersecurity Education: From Beginners to Advanced Players in Cybersecurity Competitions,"Cybersecurity competitions have been shown to be an effective approach for promoting student engagement through active learning in cybersecurity. Players can gain hands-on experience in puzzle-based or capture-the-flag type tasks that promote learning. However, novice players with limited prior knowledge in cybersecurity usually found difficult to have a clue to solve a problem and get frustrated at the early stage. To enhance student engagement, it is important to study the experiences of novices to better understand their learning needs. To achieve this goal, we conducted a 4-month longitudinal case study which involves 11 undergraduate students participating in a college-level cybersecurity competition, National Cyber League (NCL) competition. The competition includes two individual games and one team game. Questionnaires and in-person interviews were conducted before and after each game to collect the players' feedback on their experience, learning challenges and needs, and information about their motivation, interests and confidence level. The collected data demonstrate that the primary concern going into these competitions stemmed from a lack of knowledge regarding cybersecurity concepts and tools. Players' interests and confidence can be increased by going through systematic training."
9467987,Experimental Cybersecurity Level Determination in the Civil Aviation Critical Infrastructure,"Critical information infrastructure protection is a complex process, which requires effective tools for entities' identification, criticality estimation, threat and vulnerability assessment, as well as security ensuring against threats and determining the cybersecurity level. The conducted analysis has shown that today there is no complex, multifunctional method which helps to evaluate the cybersecurity level of the critical information infrastructure entity or a certain industry of the state. From this viewpoint, in the paper advantages and disadvantages of the known approaches were defined. The authors have previously developed a method for determination the level of cybersecurity in critical information infrastructure of the state. This study was continued by experiments, which tested the adequacy of the method's response to changes in input data. In addition, a special software application was developed and implemented and the developed method was verified. It is proved, that the developed method and software make it possible to calculate quantitative parameters that characterize the security of the analyzed industry, to compare the level of critical object security before and after the security mechanisms implementation."

The University of Cincinnati’s Department Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, part of a NSA Center of Excellence, is developing a new B.S. in Cybersecurity Engineering which will be coordinated with cybersecurity programs in Information Technology and in Political Science. We describe our current cybersecurity certificate progran and our proposed new B.S. in Cybersecurity Engineering, which will meet the criteria to apply for ABET EAC accreditation."
9709603,Recent Advances on Federated Learning for Cybersecurity and Cybersecurity for Federated Learning for Internet of Things,"Decentralized paradigm in the field of cybersecurity and machine learning (ML) for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) has gained a lot of attention from the government, academia, and industries in recent years. Federated cybersecurity (FC) is regarded as a revolutionary concept to make the IoT safer and more efficient in the future. This emerging concept has the potential of detecting security threats, taking countermeasures, and limiting the spreading of threats over the IoT network system efficiently. An objective of cybersecurity is achieved by forming the federation of the learned and shared model on top of various participants. Federated learning (FL), which is regarded as a privacy-aware machine learning ML model, is particularly useful to secure vulnerable IoT environment. In this paper, we start with background and comparison of centralized learning, distributed on-site learning, and FL which is then followed by a survey of the application of FL to cybersecurity for IoT. This survey primarily focuses on the security aspect but it also discusses several approaches that address the performance issues (e.g. accuracy, latency, resource constraint and others) associated with FL which may impact the security and overall performance of the IoT. To anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts, challenges, and research trends in this area. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of FL for cybersecurity as well as cybersecurity for FL, different security attacks, and countermeasures."
9156050,AI in Cybersecurity Education- A Systematic Literature Review of Studies on Cybersecurity MOOCs,"Machine learning (ML) techniques are changing both the offensive and defensive aspects of cybersecurity. The implications are especially strong for privacy, as ML approaches provide unprecedented opportunities to make use of collected data. Thus, education on cybersecurity and AI is needed. To investigate how AI and cybersecurity should be taught together, we look at previous studies on cybersecurity MOOCs by conducting a systematic literature review. The initial search resulted in 72 items and after screening for only peer-reviewed publications on cybersecurity online courses, 15 studies remained. Three of the studies concerned multiple cybersecurity MOOCs whereas 12 focused on individual courses. The number of published work evaluating specific cybersecurity MOOCs was found to be small compared to all available cybersecurity MOOCs. Analysis of the studies revealed that cybersecurity education is, in almost all cases, organised based on the topic instead of used tools, making it difficult for learners to find focused information on AI applications in cybersecurity. Furthermore, there is a gab in academic literature on how AI applications in cybersecurity should be taught in online courses."
9073610,A multi-channel cybersecurity news and threat intelligent engine - SecBuzzer,"Cyber threat such as malware and exploit have causes significant losses to the economy and has become a lucrative form of illicit business by leveraging the darkweb as a communication channel. To understand more about the emerging cyber threats of attacking tools and its actors, a threat intelligence collecting mechanism is proposed for identifying the emerging threat. With crowdsourcing intelligence and public threat intelligence such as NVD and CERT, it is able to leverage multiple sources of information and provide domain-specific security intelligence. In addition, we propose a network-based darkweb cyberthreat alert model, which can well represent and visualize actors' similarity and thus uncover the vulnerable vendor (organization) exposed in the underground markets."
9579414,"Studying Cybersecurity in Civil Aviation, Including Developing and Applying Aviation Cybersecurity Risk Assessment","In addition to the importance of safety in civil aviation, the significance of cybersecurity in the aviation sector cannot be ignored, and this fact has often been highlighted owing to frequent cyber-attacks that denigrate victim(s) and also lead to political and economic controversies. Cybersecurity has recently received a major boost, with the shift of air navigation facilities from analog ground-based systems to digital space-based systems to accommodate the tremendous growth in air traffic density. Furthermore, most air navigation facilities have open designs that tend to overlook security concerns. In this regard, identifying a systematic methodology for aviation cybersecurity risk assessment is a key element in the identification of potential threats, and assessment of their likelihood and risk levels, whereby risks can be reduced to tolerable levels through appropriate mitigation measures. Existing review articles have not addressed cybersecurity in all the various aviation systems, and have not considered a systematic methodology for aviation cybersecurity risk assessment. This paper therefore presents a systematic qualitative and quantitative cybersecurity risk assessment methodology for legacy and next-generation critical infrastructure in aviation systems, such as air-ground communication, radio navigation aids, aeronautical surveillance, and system-wide information management (SWIM). Our analysis shows that the communication, navigation, and surveillance systems with the highest risk levels are very-high frequency voice communication, satellite-based navigation, and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast, respectively, while those with the lowest risk levels are controller-pilot data link communication, ground-based radio navigation aids, and secondary surveillance radar, respectively. Furthermore, the risk level of potential cyber-attacks in SWIM is medium."
9249163,Incorporating SCADA Cybersecurity in Undergraduate Engineering Technology & Information Technology Education,"The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it makes the case for incorporating cybersecurity principles into undergraduate Engineering Technology Education and for incorporating Industrial Control Systems (ICS) principles into undergraduate Information Technology (IT)/Cybersecurity Education. Specifically, the paper highlights the knowledge/skill gap between engineers and IT/Cybersecurity professionals with respect to the cybersecurity of the ICS. Secondly, it identifies several areas where traditional IT systems and ICS intercept. This interception not only implies that ICS are susceptible to the same cyber threats as traditional IT/IS but also to threats that are unique to ICS. Subsequently, the paper identifies several areas where cybersecurity principles can be applied to ICS. By incorporating cybersecurity principles into Engineering Technology Education, the paper hopes to provide IT/Cybersecurity and Engineering Students with (a) the theoretical knowledge of the cybersecurity issues associated with administering and operating ICS and (b) the applied technical skills necessary to manage and mitigate the cyber risks against these systems. Overall, the paper holds the promise of contributing to the ongoing effort aimed at bridging the knowledge/skill gap with respect to securing ICS against cyber threats and attacks."
8953034,"Review of Cybersecurity Research Topics, Taxonomy and Challenges: Interdisciplinary Perspective","As cybersecurity is a growing field of science, there is not complete agreement across the scope of cybersecurity research topics. This paper proposes a grouping and classifications of cybersecurity researches to introduce an easily referenceable taxonomy of the cybersecurity research topics. A literature survey was conducted to collect published literature review papers about various cybersecurity researches during the past five years periods. Taxonomic analysis of 99 selected papers, which were grouped based on research topic similarities, produced sets of research categories. It categorized the cybersecurity research topics into 8 areas: (1) Applied cybersecurity, (2) Cybersecurity data science, (3) Cybersecurity education and training, (4) Cybersecurity incidents, (5) Cybersecurity management and policy, (6) Cybersecurity technology, (7) Human and social cybersecurity and (8) Theories in cybersecurity. Although cybersecurity grew out of the computer science field, this paper argues that its interdisciplinary nature (not only technical computer security, but also data, system/technology, and human/social) can attract researcher from various disciplines, such as management, policy, psychology, and so on, to contribute to cybersecurity advancement."

Many small and medium scale businesses cannot afford to procure expensive cybersecurity tools. In many cases, even after procurement, lack of a workforce with knowledge of the standard architecture of enterprise security, tools are often used ineffectively. The Editors have developed multiple projects which can help in developing cybersecurity solution architectures and the use of the right tools from the opensource software domain. This book has 8 chapters describing these projects in detail with recipes on how to use opensource tooling to obtain standard cyber defense and the ability to do self-penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. This book also demonstrates work related to malware analysis using machine learning and implementation of honeypots, network Intrusion Detection Systems in a security operation center environment. It is essential reading for cybersecurity professionals and advanced students."
9281264,Surveillance Platform of cybersecurity maturity of micro and small enterprises,"Cyberattacks are malicious and sophisticated events that attempt to exploit the principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability of organizations, causing financial losses and reputational damage, among others. In general, the number of threats and their complexity increases every day as well as the digital transformation of organizations. While it is necessary for each company to increase its digital index, it is also necessary to increase its maturity in cybersecurity. Micro and small enterprises represent a large percentage of companies in Chile, which do not always have the capital to hire qualified cybersecurity personnel. Therefore, this bridge project between the Academy and the Industry, seeks to provide tools so that micro and small companies can evaluate themselves, and potentially have the accompaniment for continuous improvement and ultimately to mature digitally using a successful proposal of the study of different cybersecurity maturity modelels reviewed in the literature."
8821951,"A survey on cybersecurity awareness concerns, practices and conceptual measures","Cybersecurity, a word that attained considerable attention and is regarded as most widely used term across all the domains that use internet. Recent technological advances have mandated the necessity of exploring various aspects of cybersecurity. Rapid cyberisation with the introduction of smart devices has enforced both government and private organizations to create an awareness on cyber threats and cybersecurity. Developed countries like New Zealand has been a frontrunner in introducing new technology and in some cases has legally mandated to implement cybersecurity procedures in various sectors including educational institutions. Though, the necessity of such implementations are never questioned, however, there has been a continues debate on implementation framework particularly for school, bursary and undergraduate syllabus.This paper is divided into three parts. Firstly, the importance of cybersecurity awareness is established by presenting various statistics, followed by the current implementations for cybersecurity awareness in terms of courses, seminars etc. The results of a comprehensive survey among various age groups is presented which gives a generic opinion on different implementations. Finally, we propose a framework that leads to the process of implementing cybersecurity awareness.The survey provides a comprehensive understand of cyber security awareness. This work will contributes on understanding the cyber security awareness state of internet users, what are important aspects and statistics to be collected as well as on the important concepts of internet security that are to be considered while designing a survey. Further, the conclusions obtained from the survey result will guide the new works on cyber security awareness programmes."
9314992,Probabilistic Modeling and Study of Cybersecurity Attacks in Industrial Control Systems of Plants,"Cybersecurity attacks on plant industrial control systems (ICS) have been on the rise. In this paper, we review plant vulnerabilities, plant cyberattacks, and security controls. We also develop and evaluate a probabilistic model for cybersecurity attacks to plant ICS with five possible attacks, three cybersecurity defense strengths, and six cybersecurity defense scenarios. A model of the overhead costs of the six cyberattacks is also presented. We then evaluate the probability of success of these six modeled attacks, particularly under the six defense scenarios. This model helps in assessing the effectiveness of cybersecurity defenses facing a variety of plant cyberattacks and can be customized for different plant situations. Our results indicate that investing in securing the lower ICS network hierarchy levels is more effective than securing the higher levels including the enterprise network level."

We plan to analyze the immersive experience, situational interest, and workload after the experiment to study the participants' learning performance and user experience."
9077598,Relating Factors of Tertiary Institution Students’ Cybersecurity Behavior,"Humans are majorly identified as the weakest link in cybersecurity. Tertiary institution students undergo lot of cybersecurity issues due to their constant Internet exposure, however there is a lack in literature with regards to tertiary institution students' cybersecurity behaviors. This research aimed at linking the factors responsible for tertiary institutions students' cybersecurity behavior, via validated cybersecurity factors, Perceived Vulnerability (PV); Perceived Barriers (PBr); Perceived Severity (PS); Security Self-Efficacy (SSE); Response Efficacy (RE); Cues to Action (CA); Peer Behavior (PBhv); Computer Skills (CS); Internet Skills (IS); Prior Experience with Computer Security Practices (PE); Perceived Benefits (PBnf); Familiarity with Cyber-Threats (FCT), thus exploring the relationship between the factors and the students' Cybersecurity Behaviors (CSB). A cross-sectional online survey was used to gather data from 450 undergraduate and postgraduate students from tertiary institutions within Klang Valley, Malaysia. Correlation Analysis was used to find the relationships existing among the cybersecurity behavioral factors via SPSS version 25. Results indicate that all factors were significantly related to the cybersecurity behaviors of the students apart from Perceived Severity. Practically, the study instigates the need for more cybersecurity training and practices in the tertiary institutions."
9592133,8 CYBERSECURITY FOR THE FUTURE,"stract:
In this final chapter, I will discuss a number of innovative cybersecurity research areas that are worth noting: outcome-based cyber defense, artificial intelligence / machine learning, and Computer immunology. Outcome-based cyber defense focuses on attack outcomes rather than the attacks themselves. Recall that there are three primary cyberattack outcomes: denial-of-service attacks, data theft attacks, and misinformation attacks (i.e., cyber deception). Denial-of-service attacks prevent legitimate users from accessing systems or data that belong to them. Data theft attacks remove information that pertains to authorized users. Misinformation attacks cause legitimate users to make decisions based on erroneous information (e.g., phishing)."
8548564,Cybersecurity Interventions for Teens: Two Time-Based Approaches,"Contribution: Intervention effectiveness is shown to vary in its influence on teenagers' outcomes with cybersecurity problem-solving and engagement. In-depth, high-intensity types of intervention may be more effective for female students. Background: Instructional interventions are being developed to address both the critical shortage in cybersecurity talent and gender gaps in the cyber workforce. These interventions need rigorous evaluation. Specific types of instructional strategies are particularly effective for STEM learning. Also, gender differences are found in the benefit students derive from certain instructional methods. An important question is whether certain instructional methods are particularly effective for cybersecurity learning, and consistent in both male and female students. Research Questions: Do cybersecurity interventions affect problem-solving, cybersecurity engagement, and/or cybersecurity self-efficacy? Are there gender differences in terms of intervention effectiveness? Methodology: Study 1 (n = 79) included a 60-min workshop model where participants, assigned to treatment and control groups, completed surveys pre- and post-intervention. The treatment group experienced a workshop on computer networking, without any technology. The control group did not receive the workshop. Study 2 (n = 34) was a week-long intervention whose participants had formal lessons, built websites, and defended themselves from an ongoing simulated cyberattack. Participants completed a survey on cybersecurity learning and engagement three times during the intervention. Findings: Study 1 showed no main treatment effect, but females experienced greater gains in problem-solving than males. In Study 2, there was positive growth over time and females experienced greater growth in cybersecurity self-efficacy relative to males."

These case studies show the cybersecurity challenges and concerns triggered by these limited technologies and how they are addressed by regulations, standards, and technical mechanisms. The goal of these case studies is to illustrate how regulation and technologies attempt to protect the cybersecurity interests in industrial contexts. Finally, the case studies aim to generate an understanding of challenges and how standards and technology address cybersecurity issues in these industrial contexts."
8725885,Cybersecurity Vulnerability Mitigation Framework Through Empirical Paradigm (CyFEr): Prioritized Gap Analysis,"Cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tools, frameworks, methodologies, and processes are commonly used to understand the cybersecurity maturity and posture of a system or a facility. Although those tools are strictly developed based on standards defined by organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Energy, the majority of these tools and frameworks do not provide a platform to prioritize the requirements to reach a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we have been developing a framework and a software application called the cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). The efficacy of CyFEr was evaluated by implementing it on the NIST cybersecurity framework (CSF). This paper provides a detailed architecture of CyFEr and demonstrates its application to CSF by testing against a real-world cyberattack that targeted industrial control systems in a critical infrastructure facility."
9319872,"Cy-Through: Toward a Cybersecurity Simulation for Supporting Live, Virtual, and Constructive Interoperability","Cybersecurity simulation is a useful, practical approach to provide insights to counter cyber threats for organizations with a large-scale, complex cyber environment. From the micro behavior of malware on a host to the macroscopic impact of a DDoS attack, various phenomena can be observed and analyzed with simulation scenarios. Many platforms for cybersecurity simulation have been developed to support simulation scenarios and models with different fidelity levels: live, virtual, and constructive. Many platforms for cybersecurity simulation have been developed to support simulation scenarios and models with varying fidelity levels: live, virtual, and constructive. Hence, the support of interoperability between models with different fidelities remained untrodden in the cybersecurity simulation literature. In this paper, we propose a novel cybersecurity simulation platform, Cy-Through, which enables full interoperability between models with different fidelity levels, live/virtual and constructive models. Through the development and demonstration of a prototype of the platform, we prove the possibility of a Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC)-interoperable cybersecurity simulation."

8666518,Application of Rank-Weight Methods to Blockchain Cybersecurity Vulnerability Assessment Framework,"Cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tools, frameworks, and methodologies are used to understand the cybersecurity maturity of a system or a facility. However, these tools are strictly developed based on standards defined by organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Energy; the majority of these tools and frameworks do not provide a platform to prioritize the requirements to reach a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we have been developing a framework and software application called cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). CyFEr treats the problem at hand as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem, which requires that various criteria be weighed relatively. Defining those weights is non-trivial and often leads to subjective decisions leading to undesired complications. To facilitate such a weighting system in CyFEr, we evaluated the application of various rank-weight methods (such as rank sum, reciprocal rank, rank exponent, and rank order centroid). The efficacy of those rank-weight methods was evaluated by applying them and testing against the blockchain cybersecurity framework (BC2F). BC2F was developed using the NIST cybersecurity framework to evaluate the cybersecurity posture of the blockchain nodes and networks in a given blockchain application or use-case. This paper provides 1) technical insights on the application of rank-weight methods to cybersecurity vulnerability assessments, 2) an overview of BC2F, 3) the application of rank-weight methods to BC2F, and 4) a depiction of the integration of the discussed rank-weight methods in CyFEr."

Although the Wisconsin Department of Administration has been actively encouraging collaboration efforts between the public and private sectors and promoting cybersecurity as a promising career path, the demand for cybersecurity professionals continues to be greater than the supply, which is a trend noticed also nationwide. The state of Wisconsin is facing several challenges in attempting to promote cybersecurity including limited security curricula resources, lack of programs and other initiatives that promote security principles, and lack of awareness of cybersecurity risks. In this paper, we discuss the major challenges Wisconsin is facing towards establishing proper cyber hygiene for the general population and growing the cybersecurity work force. In addition, we suggest ways to overcome or lessen the effect of the identified issues."

Internet security has become an enormous challenge. Almost everything we see, touch, or use is connected to the internet, including cell phones, wearable devices, home appliances, and even semiautonomous vehicles. The internet is a portal for businesses, governments, and other institutions, providing remote access to trade secrets, medical records, and financial data. And such is the paradox of connectivity: the more connected our computer systems, the more exposed they are to cyberattacks—attempts to steal data, corrupt software, disrupt operations, and even physically damage hardware and networked infrastructures."

Cybersecurity audits assist organizations to deal with cyber threats, cybercriminals, and cyber-attacks thatare growing in an aggressive cyber landscape. However, cyber-attacks and threats become more increase and complex in complicated cyber landscapes challenge auditors to perform an effective cybersecurity audit. This current situation puts in evidens ce the critical need for a new approach in the cybersecurity audit execution. This study reviews an alternative method in the execution of cybersecurity security checks. The analysis is on the character and behavioral of cyber-attacks and threats using feature extraction and selection method to get crucial elements from the common group of cyber-attacks and threats. Cyber-attacks and threats profile are systematic approaches driven by a clear understanding of the form of cyber-attacks and threats character and behavior patterns in cybersecurity requirements. As a result, this study proposes cyber-attacks and threats profiling for cybersecurity audit as a set of control elements that are harmonized with audit components that drive audits based on cyber threats."

However, at present, the lack of software testing tools in vehicle industry and the lack of cybersecurity detection and evaluation are serious problems, which need to be solved urgently. This paper focuses on this issue, we carry out the research of ICV detection and evaluation platform, and explore the technology of ICV cybersecurity detection. In addition, we build a database of vehicle cybersecurity vulnerabilities to provide data support, and use source code analysis, firmware reverse, penetration test, simulation and other detection technologies to carry out cybersecurity evaluation for vehicle terminals, data communications, cloud platform and APP. Full detection and risk assessment is designed to build an ICV security detection and assessment platform."

9378014,Resolving the cybersecurity Data Sharing Paradox to scale up cybersecurity via a co-production approach towards data sharing,"As cybercriminals scale up their operations to increase their profits or inflict greater harm, we argue that there is an equal need to respond to their threats by scaling up cyber-security. To achieve this goal, we have to develop a co-productive approach towards data collection and sharing by overcoming the cybersecurity data sharing paradox. This is where we all agree on the definition of the problem and end goal (improving cybersecurity and getting rid of cybercrime), but we disagree about how to achieve it and fail to work together efficiently. At the core of this paradox is the observation that public interests differ from private interests. As a result, industry and law enforcement take different approaches to the cybersecurity problem as they seek to resolve incidents in their own interests, which manifests in different data sharing practices between both and also other interested parties, such as cybersecurity researchers. The big question we ask is can these interests be reconciled to develop an interdisciplinary approach towards co-operation and sharing data. In essence, all three will have to co-own the problem in order to co-produce a solution. We argue that a few operational models with good practices exist that provide guides to a possible solution, especially multiple third-party ownership organisations which consolidate, anonymise and analyse data. To take this forward, we suggest the practical solution of organising co-productive data collection on a sectoral basis, but acknowledge that common standards for data collection will also have to be developed and agreed upon. We propose an initial set of best practices for building collaborations and sharing data and argue that these best practices need to be developed and standardised in order to mitigate the paradox."
9220752,Cybersecurity named entity recognition using bidirectional long short-term memory with conditional random fields,"Network texts have become important carriers of cybersecurity information on the Internet. These texts include the latest security events such as vulnerability exploitations, attack discoveries, advanced persistent threats, and so on. Extracting cybersecurity entities from these unstructured texts is a critical and fundamental task in many cybersecurity applications. However, most Named Entity Recognition (NER) models are suitable only for general fields, and there has been little research focusing on cybersecurity entity extraction in the security domain. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel cybersecurity entity identification model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with Conditional Random Fields (Bi-LSTM with CRF) to extract security-related concepts and entities from unstructured text. This model, which we have named XBiLSTM-CRF, consists of a word-embedding layer, a bidirectional LSTM layer, and a CRF layer, and concatenates X input with bidirectional LSTM output. Via extensive experiments on an open-source dataset containing an office security bulletin, security blogs, and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, we demonstrate that XBiLSTM-CRF achieves better cybersecurity entity extraction than state-of-the-art models."

In this sense, this research focuses on the evaluation of characteristics for different well-established Machine Leaning algorithms commonly applied to IDS scenarios. To do this, a categorization for cybersecurity data sets that groups its records into several groups is first considered. Making use of this division, this work seeks to determine which neural network model (multilayer or recurrent), activation function, and learning algorithm yield higher accuracy values, depending on the group of data. Finally, the results are used to determine which group of data from a cybersecurity data set are more relevant and representative for the intrusion detection, and the most suitable configuration of Machine Learning algorithm to decrease the computational load of the system."

This paper aims to review issues that motivate the research of cybersecurity audit and the approaches to manage and execute it. Previous works in this area of interest are discussed by classifying and analyzing the current approaches. Models, scopes, strengths and limitations are studied and the most effective and accurate synthesis that can improve the quality of cybersecurity audits is highlighted. Various approaches to manage and execute cybersecurity audit with their objectives and advantages are classified. From this literature review, it is clear that cybersecurity audits can be improved by addressing the highlighted issues and create a well-rounded approach to improve the management and execution of auditing.

The software which has been developed to support the development and use of cybersecurity inference graphs is described including details of the public server where it can be used. It is shown that cybersecurity inference graphs can significantly contribute to development of, and validation of cybersecurity and also that rigorous validation of cybersecurity is not necessarily as difficult as previously thought."
9583716,Cybersecurity Test Range for Autonomous Vehicle Shuttles,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) shuttles for public transportation are challenged by a lack of cybersecurity testing and platforms to conduct testing. Real-world, operational vehicles are expensive and operators are reluctant to test cybersecurity test cases that could impart damage to the systems. Furthermore, despite rigorous regression testing methods used within the broader automotive industry, vulnerabilities of automotive systems are still being found by creative edge and corner cases. To enable testing for edge and corner cases for AV shuttles, we propose the integration of cyber-physical test beds and ranges into the testing program of real-world AV shuttles. We evaluated the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) DuckieBot as the basis for comprehensive cybersecurity vulnerability testing and show how the results can be applied to the iseAuto, a real-world AV shuttle operating in Tallinn, Estonia. The MIT DuckieBot test bed is used to replicate the complexity and interactions of relevant systems of the iseAuto AV shuttle. The practical evaluation, involving cybersecurity edge and corner test cases demonstrated that cyber-physical test beds and ranges can support agile, repeatable cybersecurity testing that is low-cost and is conducted in a controlled and safe environment."

8888060,Powering Hands-on Cybersecurity Practices with Cloud Computing,"Cybersecurity education and training have gained increasing attention in all sectors due to the prevalence and quick evolution of cyberattacks. A variety of platforms and systems have been proposed and developed to accommodate the growing needs of hands-on cybersecurity practice. However, those systems are either lacking sufficient flexibility (e.g., tied to a specific virtual computing service provider, little customization support) or difficult to scale. In this work, we present a cloud-based platform named EZSetup for hands-on cybersecurity practice at scale and our experience of using it in class. EZSetup is customizable and cloud-agnostic. Users can create labs through an intuitive Web interface and deploy them onto one or multiple clouds. We have used NSF funded Chameleon cloud and our private OpenStack cloud to develop, test and deploy EZSetup. We have developed 14 network and security labs using the tool and included six labs in an undergraduate network security course in spring 2019. Our survey results show that students have very positive feedback on using EZSetup and computing clouds for hands-on cybersecurity practice."
9274033,Overcoming the Challenges of Teaching Cybersecurity in UK Computer Science Degree Programmes,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper explores the diversity of challenges relating to the teaching of cybersecurity in UK higher education degree programmes, through the lens of national policy, to the impact on pedagogy and practice. There is a serious demand for cybersecurity specialists, both in the UK and globally; there is thus significant and growing higher education provision related to specialist undergraduate and postgraduate courses focusing on varying aspects of cybersecurity. To make our digital systems and products more secure, all in IT need to know some cybersecurity - thus, there is a case for depth as well as breadth; this is not a new concern, but it is a growing one. Delivering cybersecurity effectively across general computer science programmes presents a number of challenges related to pedagogy, resources, faculty and infrastructure, as well as responding to industry requirements. Computer science and cognate engineering disciplines are evolving to meet these demands - both at school-level, as well as at university - however, doing so is not without challenges. This paper explores the progress made to date in the UK, building on previous work in cybersecurity education and accreditation by highlighting key challenges and opportunities, as well as identifying a number of enhancement activities for use by the international cybersecurity education community. It frames these challenges through concerns with the quality and availability of underpinning educational resources, the competencies and skills of faculty (especially focusing on pedagogy, progression and assessment), and articulating the necessary technical resources and infrastructure related to delivering rigorous cybersecurity content in general computer science and cognate degrees. Though this critical evaluation of an emerging national case study of cybersecurity education in the UK, we also present a number of recommendations across policy and practice - from pedagogic principles and dev...

Numerous cybersecurity data exists in textual sources and data analysis is difficult for both security analyst and the machine. To convert the textual information into structured data for further automatic analysis, we extract cybersecurity-related entities and propose a self-attention-based neural network model for the named entity recognition in cybersecurity. Considering the single word feature not enough for identifying the entity, we introduce CNN to extract character feature which is then concatenated into the word feature. Then we add the self-attention mechanism based on the existing BiLSTM-CRF model. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model on the labelled dataset and obtain a better performance than the previous entity extraction model."
8939168,Cybersecurity and Driverless Cars: In Search for a Normative Way of Safety,"Burgeoning technological advancements have led to a quest for efficiency and haste in almost every area. This includes advanced technologies in transportation. Among such technologies are driverless cars that pose as perfect models for promising technology engines. These cars have received much attention and appreciation from high-tech companies. Studies have shown that they are statistically much safer than traditional vehicles; however, many issues remain which must be corrected to make the driverless car even more safe and reliable. For example, cyber-attacks on driverless cars are a major safety concern. Like any new technology, innovations of autonomous and unmanned vehicles have led to the emergence of threats of cyber-attacks. Hackers see multiple attack surfaces and believe they can penetrate any targeted vehicle system, steal an owner's personal identity information and compromise the vehicles security. Therefore, driverless car industries must put into place an efficient cybersecurity framework which will effectively counter cyber-attacks on driverless cars. In this study, we propose implementing a cybersecurity policy framework that examines potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities against driverless car systems. Threats and attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities are then identified and analyzed. This study investigates current status quo policy, policy objectives, the role of technology, and mitigation strategies for cybersecurity to be used in the development of driverless car systems. Cybersecurity systems are proposed and discussed in the final section."

9583711,A Model-Driven Methodology for Automotive Cybersecurity Test Case Generation,"Through international regulations (most prominently the latest UNECE regulation) and standards, the already widely perceived higher need for cybersecurity in automotive systems has been recognized and will mandate higher efforts for cybersecurity engineering. The UNECE also demands the effectiveness of these engineering to be verified and validated through testing. This requires both a significantly higher rate and more comprehensiveness of cybersecurity testing that is not effectively to cope with using current, predominantly manual, automotive cybersecurity testing techniques. To allow for comprehensive and efficient testing at all stages of the automotive life cycle, including supply chain parts not at hand, and to facilitate efficient third party testing, as well as to test under real-world conditions, also methodologies for testing the cybersecurity of vehicular systems as a black box are necessary. This paper therefore presents a model and attack tree-based approach to (semi-)automate automotive cybersecurity testing, as well as considerations for automatically black box-deriving models for the use in attack modeling."
8703422,Ambidextrous Cybersecurity: The Seven Pillars (7Ps) of Cyber Resilience,"Organizational ambidexterity balances exploitative and exploratory behaviors so that organizations are able to exploit their existing competencies while simultaneously exploring new opportunities. Similarly, ambidextrous cybersecurity (AMBI-CYBER) focuses on the protection of data, systems, and networks, while fostering the rapid introduction of new technologies within a company. This balance is linked to cybersecurity absorptive capacity and defines the “Cybersecurity Efficient Frontier.” In this paper, we view AMBI-CYBER as a combination of organizational as well as technological and cultural competences which rely upon a multifaceted, multimodal, multinodal, and multilevel set of skills and capabilities. We outline the anatomy of the AMBI-CYBER architecture adopting a balanced scorecard, multistage approach under a 7Ps stage gate model (Patient, Persistent, Persevering, Proactive, Predictive, Preventive, and Preemptive). Such an approach emphasizes the need to enable a complex, nonlinear, adaptive process of dynamic intangible organizational assets, resources, and capabilities across a performance frontier where we aim to optimize safety, security, and privacy effectiveness and efficiency. We also suggests that the Quadruple/Quintuple Helix Innovation model may promote AMBI-CYBER enabling a locus-centric and triple-bottom-line-centric entrepreneurial process of discovery followed by development, exploration, exploitation, and deployment."

Cybersecurity needs a change in communication. It is time to show the world that cybersecurity is an exciting and diverse field to work in. Cybersecurity is not only about hackers and technical gobbledygook. It is a diverse field of work with a lot of collaboration with other disciplines. Over the years, security professionals have tried different awareness strategies to promote their work and to improve the knowledge of their audience but without much success. Communication problems are holding back advances in in the field. Visual Communication for Cybersecurity explores the possibilities of visual communication as a tool to improve the communication about cybersecurity and to better connect with non-experts. Visual communication is useful to explain complex topics and to solve complex problems. Visual tools are easy to share through social media and have the possibility to reach a wide audience. When applied strategically, visual communication can contribute to a people-centric approach to security, where employees are encouraged to actively engage in security activities rather than simply complying with the policies. Cybersecurity education does not usually include communication theory or creative skills. Many experts think that it is not part of their job and is best left to the communication department or they think that they lack any creative talent. This book introduces communication theories and models, gives practical tips, and shows many examples.

There is very little research on qualitative machine-learning based methods for the analysis of student feedback in cybersecurity courses, if any courses. This research fills the literature gap by analyzing the feedback from 114 open-ended surveys across five cybersecurity and digital forensic courses to categorize areas of course improvement. To gain insights into the qualitative survey feedback, we employed term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) with a K-Means clustering algorithm on cleaned and pre-processed survey data. This methodology provides more useful insights for curriculum developers than a standard sentiment analysis. The methodology can be further extended to be directly integrated into continual course improvement (e.g. ABET, NSA, DoD, etc.) indicators."
9403180,Named Entity Recognition Using BERT with Whole World Masking in Cybersecurity Domain,"Nowadays the amount of cybersecurity data grows quickly on the Internet, however most of them are textual unstructured data, which is hard for security analysis to understand in time and is not suitable for automated security systems to directly use. The automated and real-time switching of cybersecurity information from unstructured text sources to structured representations can help the cyber threat intelligence analysis know the cyber situation better. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is able to convert unstructured data into structured data. Recently, a language representation model named Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has achieved great improvements among different NLP tasks. In this paper, we apply BERT and its improved version BERT with whole world masking (BERT wwm ) to the NER task for cybersecurity. We combine the BERT model with the BiLSTM-CRF architecture, and the experiment reveals that our method achieves greater performance on the precision, recall, and F1 score compared with the state-of-the-art model whether on the overall entity or single entity."

9119756,An Interledger Blockchain Platform for Cross-Border Management of Cybersecurity Information,"Cybersecurity certification is a core notion to support the mitigation of cybersecurity risks of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). At the European Union (EU) level, the Cybersecurity Act establishes a common cybersecurity certification framework supporting the coexistence of different certification schemes across Member States. However, its realization needs to be sustained by technical approaches to enable ICT stakeholders from different sectors or countries to exchange cybersecurity information and evaluate the up-to-date security level of an ICT system throughout their lifecycle. Toward this end, we propose a blockchain-based platform using a novel interledger design, where ledgers associated with ICT artifacts, cybersecurity certificates, and vulnerabilities are interconnected. The main purpose is to leverage the advantages of blockchain in terms of distributed trust, transparency, and accountability, while at the same time coping with scalability, performance, and interoperability requirements. We analyze the impact of our platform in the current EU legislation and provide insights for its deployment."
8802402,Cybersecurity Experimentation at Program Scale: Guidelines and Principles for Future Testbeds,"Cybersecurity Experimentation is often viewed narrowly in terms of a single technology or experiment. This paper reviews the experimentation life-cycle for two large scale research efforts that span multiple technologies. We identify salient aspects of each cybersecurity program, and capture guidelines based on eight years of experience. Extrapolating, we identify four principles for building future experimental infrastructure: 1) Reduce the cognitive burden on experimenters when designing and operating experiments. 2) Allow experimenters to encode their goals and constraints. 3) Provide flexibility in experimental design. 4) Provide multifaceted guidance to help experimenters produce high-quality experiments. By following these principles, future cybersecurity testbeds can enable significantly higher-quality experiments."
8853713,Cybersecurity Risk Assessment for Space Systems,"When considering critical infrastructure, we rarely consider the enabling technology and systems that realize such infrastructure; such as, agribusiness' reliance on weather and climate satellites, the U.S. military's reliance on intelligence satellites, and various transportation industries' reliance on global positioning system (GPS) satellites. Most of the world's critical infrastructure relies on space systems. While there is considerable effort to improve the cybersecurity of the critical infrastructure, there is less focus on cybersecurity for space systems. Challenges to secure space systems included technology development, ownership, and management perspective. This limits guidance in the form of standards that govern space system security and, ultimately, policies that enforce these standards."

9453958,Cybersecurity Teaching Expert Development Project by KOSEN Security Educational Community,"Threats of cyber attacks are rampant all over the world. The threats are getting stronger year by year. In 2015, the National Institute of Technology (KOSEN) launched the KOSEN Security Educational Community (K-SEC) and started cyber security training for KOSEN students. This project has two main purposes that one is outstanding cyber security human resource development which objects for improving quality and other one is fostering many KOSEN students who have systematically acquired security knowledge which objects for quantitative expansion. As part of K-SEC, research of cyber security human resource development education has been promoted. A new project ”Highly Advanced Cybersecurity for KOSEN (HACK) ” has been launched within K-SEC to accelerate the achievement of the two main purposes since 2019. HACK is a project based on the simple idea of strengthening KOSEN technical staff in order to foster strong students who have acquired practical cyber security skills. The plan is a three-year plan. HACK has three main objectives which are improving faculties ' and technical staffs' skills, the development excellent teaching materials based on the skills and to create both skills and human resources network. The success of HACK is important to contribute not only to security education but also to the examination of KOSEN or engineering education centered on practical education.

9437745,A Framework for Document-level Cybersecurity Event Extraction from Open Source Data,"With the rapid development of the Internet, the number of cyber threats increases exponentially. More and more cyber threats come from new and unexpected sources, leading organizations and individuals to facing more security risks and vulnerabilities. Automatically obtaining and structuring security information from cybersecurity news can help security analysts to identify useful information more quickly. Most existing studies on extracting security events merely focused on the event detection task, aiming to discover and categorize cybersecurity events from the plain text. However, such event detection methods cannot capture useful information such as who performed the cyberattack, when the data breach event happened, who was the victim, etc. These arguments of a cybersecurity event are needed for analysts to get cybersecurity event details directly. Several studies have tried to extract rich semantic information of cybersecurity events, but they merely focused on extracting event arguments within the sentence scope. These studies still have limitations when the event arguments needed to recognize spread across multiple sentences. In this paper, we proposed a framework that effectively extracts cybersecurity events at the document-level from cybersecurity news, blogs and announcements. We model the document level event extraction task as a sequence tagging problem. The goal is to identify the related arguments of cybersecurity events from documents. Firstly, we get the characters embedding and incorporate the word information into the character representations. Then we design a sliding window mechanism to get the cross-sentence context information. Finally, we predict the label of each character. We build a Chinese cybersecurity dataset and use three methods to evaluate our method, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model."
8998503,Fuzzy Logic Application to Link National Culture and Cybersecurity Maturity,"National culture and cybersecurity maturity (CM) both play defining roles in the identity and security of a nation. This study examines the relationship that these two constructs play in determining whether certain cultural dimensions of a nation leads to riskier cybersecurity behaviours. Based on the confirmed affirmation of the relationship between national culture and CM, we develop a research model based on fuzzy logic to predict the level of influence that national culture has on a country's Cybersecurity Maturity Level (CML). The fuzzy model was generated based on three semantic steps: (1) conducting statistical correlation analyses based on datasets related to 65 countries; (2) synthesizing a fuzzy model based on the derived knowledge; and (3) evaluating the fuzzy model based on public domain CM data across three case study countries. Our statistical analyses reveal a strong correlation between the cultural dimensions of Power Distance (PDI), Long Term Orientation (LTO), and Individualism (IDV) with login strength, implicating that these dimensions also strongly impact CM. Consequently, the proposed fuzzy model takes PDI, LTO, and IDV as the inputs to derive a quantitative value to the Global Cybersecurity Index related to a particular country. Hence, the novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach of creating and validating a model that can be used to determine the influence that national culture has on CML. Furthermore, this study suggests that national culture must be factored in when determining cybersecurity policy and frameworks which govern individuals within a nation's CM development."

9378482,A Comparative Study of Deep Learning based Named Entity Recognition Algorithms for Cybersecurity,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) is important in the cybersecurity domain. It helps researchers extract cyber threat information from unstructured text sources. The extracted cyber-entities or key expressions can be used to model a cyber-attack described in an open-source text. A large number of general-purpose NER algorithms have been published that work well in text analysis. These algorithms do not perform well when applied to the cybersecurity domain. In the field of cybersecurity, the open-source text available varies greatly in complexity and under-lying structure of the sentences. General-purpose NER algorithms can misrepresent domain-specific words, such as ""malicious"" and ""javascript"". In this paper, we compare the recent deep learning-based NER algorithms on a cybersecurity dataset. We created a cybersecurity dataset collected from various sources, including ""Microsoft Security Bulletin"" and ""Adobe Security Updates"". Some of these approaches proposed in literature were not used for Cybersecurity. Others are innovations proposed by us. This comparative study helps us identify the NER algorithms that are robust and can work well in sentences taken from a large number of cybersecurity sources. We tabulate their performance on the test set and identify the best NER algorithm for a cybersecurity corpus. We also discuss the different embedding strategies that aid in the process of NER for the chosen deep learning algorithms."
9467852,An Open-Source Testbed to Visualise ICS Cybersecurity Weaknesses and Remediation Strategies – A Research Agenda Proposal,"Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are responsible for the control of several processes in various critical infrastructure deployments ranging from energy, power and water utilities, to manufacturing sectors such as pharmaceutical precision engineering. They ensure the smooth, safe running and High Availability of these critical infrastructure and manufacturing processes. ICS cybersecurity is of increasing concern and this is evidenced by the mounting examples of cyber threats and attacks on ICS infrastructure that are referenced both within the technical community and the public media. The barriers of entry to ICS cybersecurity are still high given the limited skills base, expensive and proprietary hardware and software, as well as the inherent dangers of manipulating real physical processes. This greatly inhibits the practical application of cybersecurity tools in ICS environments and therefore the opportunity for practitioners to gain valuable experience. Furthermore, historical ICS testbeds have not delivered a practical application of accessing and improving ICS security posture as poisited in known ICS industry standards. This project seeks to build a comprehensive opensource virtualised ICS testbed to demonstrate typical cybersecurity weaknesses in an ICS environment as well as suitable remediation strategies. This testbed shall simulate real world industrial systems as closely as possible without replicating an entire plant. This research will identify a suitable ICS testbed to visualise the stages of an ICS cyber attack with reference to the ICS cyber kill chain proposed by the SysAdmin, Audit, Network and Security Institute. With the selected ICS testbed as a reference, this project shall also demonstrate an ICS cybersecurity evaluation based on the US National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework, detailing how defenders can identify vulnerable components in the ICS, identify potential threat vectors within the environment and devel...

8975537,Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities of Smart Inverters and Their Impacts on Power System Operation,"Smart Inverters (SIs) are becoming more popular with their ability to support voltage and frequency in a grid. This helps overcome the natural limitation of renewable energy deployments. More companies are looking at using SIs in their networks and closely study their impacts of these devices on the power system operation. Carefully controlled test environments show that necessary auxiliary support can be received from SIs. However, these modes actively inject power into the grid and may cause unknown problems. Especially if the SI control block is compromised by a hacker, these problems may have disastrous consequences. In order to fill this gap and investigate these points, a newly developed simulation platform called Sora-Grid is utilized to investigate impacts of cyberattacks on SI operation as well as power system operation at large. With the integration of Information Technologies (IT) and automation in power systems, cybersecurity has become a real threat and a concern. Most of the cybersecurity research focuses on large scale power plants that are connected at transmission level. This work analyzes the impact of such attacks on small-scale inverters that are connected to distribution networks. Based on these findings, cybersecurity measures can be developed to secure SI operation."

In this paper, they will be discussed from quality management point of view."
8992971,Assurance for CyberSecurity with Assume-Guarantee Reasoning,"Design of cybersecurity solutions for a network is a challenging problem as it involves the integration of several complex components such as routers, servers, computers, smart devices, that include not only essential networking algorithms but also security algorithms. This is further complicated by the need to have robust security policies implemented to prevent violation of confidentiality as the networked devices interact. The design of such complex networked systems demand a more rigorous approach to the modeling and analysis at a higher level of abstraction, which can be inherited from the field of formal methods in software engineering for safety critical systems. Presently, network or security engineers do not use a formal method based software engineering approach to design and build cybersecurity systems. Thus, we propose a software engineering based formal approach to model and analyze cybersecurity, that along with identification of concrete requirements enables automated analysis to guarantee cybersecurity properties are satisfied within the network. In this research paper, we discuss an ontology guided assume-guarantee based formal approach to model and analyze a designed network. To enable this approach, a domain specific language is designed that allows association of assumptions with components in the network that allows verifying the satisfaction of contracts that are guarantees. The formal language designed includes reserved words are guided by the CyberSecurity domain and the semantic reasoning is based on formal architectural representation."
9210363,Cybersecurity Attacks on Smart Home During Covid-19 Pandemic,"COVID-19 has generated that dynamics in the context of cybersecurity change significantly, due to the displacing of activities of organizations in the city to home in telework mode. The cybersecurity architecture at home does not have the same levels of security as in organizations, even more if the house has been developed under a smart infrastructure (smart home) scheme, the cybersecurity attack surface expands. This context could be one of the reasons why the number of attacks has increased significantly to more than 35%. VPN solutions are uses to protect telecommuting communications but security attacks exploit vulnerabilities of home-equipment and people, so VPN solutions could reduce their efficiency. Attackers have focused on social engineering attacks that use the concerns generated by the covid-19 pandemic to be more effective in their attacks. This study presents an analysis of cybersecurity attacks that have appeared during this pandemic and how it forces to change defense strategies in cybersecurity."

8673585,Cybersecurity in Big Data Era: From Securing Big Data to Data-Driven Security,"‘‘Knowledge is power” is an old adage that has been found to be true in today’s information age. Knowledge is derived from having access to information. The ability to gather information from large volumes of data has become an issue of relative importance. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is the term coined by researchers to describe the art of processing, storing and gathering large amounts of data for future examination. Data is being produced at an alarming rate. The rapid growth of the Internet, Internet of Things (IoT) and other technological advances are the main culprits behind this sustained growth. The data generated is a reflection of the environment it is produced out of, thus we can use the data we get out of systems to figure out the inner workings of that system. This has become an important feature in cybersecurity where the goal is to protect assets. Furthermore, the growing value of data has made big data a high value target. In this paper, we explore recent research works in cybersecurity in relation to big data. We highlight how big data is protected and how big data can also be used as a tool for cybersecurity. We summarize recent works in the form of tables and have presented trends, open research challenges and problems. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of cybersecurity in the big data era, as well as research trends and open challenges in this active research area."
9272723,Cybersecurity of Smart Electric Vehicle Charging: A Power Grid Perspective,"With the roll-out of electric vehicles (EVs), the automobile industry is transitioning away from conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles. As a result, the EV charging demand is continuously growing and to meet this growing demand, various types of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are being deployed for commercial and residential use. This nexus of EVs, EVCSs, and power grids creates complex cyber-physical interdependencies that can be maliciously exploited to damage each of these components. This paper describes and analyzes cyber vulnerabilities that arise at this nexus and points to the current and emerging gaps in the security of the EV charging ecosystem. These vulnerabilities must be addressed as the number of EVs continue to grow worldwide and their impact on the power grid becomes more viable. The purpose of this paper is to list and characterize all backdoors that can be exploited to seriously harm either EV and EVCS equipments, or power grid, or both. The presented issues and challenges intend to ignite research efforts on cybersecurity of smart EV charging and enhancing power grid resiliency against such demand-side cyberattacks in general."

9020351,Design of a Testbed for Cybersecurity Research on Power Converters in Microgrids,"In this paper, we study the design of an Internet-enabled power electronic converter for cybersecurity research in microgrid systems. The motivation for this paper comes from the OpenPLC project [1], and the development of a PLC testbed which can be used for cybersecurity research [2]. Depending on the economics of the problem, having dedicated and protected communication channels may not be economically feasible, especially for microgrid systems. In other words, the economics of the application may dictate the use of common and unprotected communication channels, like the Internet for higher level coordination. This means that the embedded system responsible for time-sensitive tasks, like power management, energy management, voltage regulation, or reactive power sharing, must also have some awareness of potential cyber threats. In particular, its state transition diagram, timeout values for blocking I/O operations, whether it will be bare-metal or not, and where the TCP/IP stack will run, are all very critical design issues. In this work, different design architectures are analyzed, the pros and cons of each option are studied, and a final system architecture is proposed."

8961044,Countering Cybersecurity and Counterfeit Material Threats in Test Systems,"Automatic test systems designed to validate the performance of military and aerospace products have always been held to a higher standard; moreover, emerging threats to data security and instrumentation integrity continue to raise this bar. Engineers are faced with growing pressure to not only ensure that the unit under test (UUT) meets all design criteria, but that it remains safe from malicious attacks aimed at gaining access to test parameters or results, controlling of test sequences and functionality, downloading malware, or impacting functionality by way of counterfeit parts installed in instrumentation. This paper will delve into the cybersecurity issue from the perspective of the test development environment, including the use of test executives, and the challenges associated with minimizing impact to data integrity and access to control. An undetected data breach on military / aerospace automated test equipment (ATE) holds significance beyond just the test system, since mission critical electronics associated with avionics, radar, electronic warfare and missile assemblies must also be protected. One topic discussed will be the impact of adopting methods and procedures detailed in the Department of Defense's (DoD) Application Security Technical Implementation Guide, which is based on NIST documents and details how to manage and maintain a secure software-based system such as an ATE system. Another aspect of cybersecurity that is often overlooked in the world of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) instrumentation and switching systems is the potential impact on the UUT from substandard counterfeit parts and those embedded with malware. Concerns with counterfeit material can encompass a range of threats including the re-purposing of used parts and new knockoff parts with substandard operating characteristics represented and sold as new hardware. One of the most concerning aspects, parts intentionally infected with malware, can pose a significant risk to personnel ...

9155972,Pedagogical Challenges and Ethical Considerations in Developing Critical Thinking in Cybersecurity,"The online world of today offers both possibilities and challenges, increasingly requiring critical thinking to distinguish between truth and lies. One has to tell the real news and videos from the fake ones at election campaigns, to distinguish fake online shops from the real ones, and recognize catfishing attempts in budding relationships. The aim of our paper is to discuss pedagogical and ethical challenges online, using the deliberately created fake accounts as a tool to teach students critical thinking and other digital survival skills. In 2018 and 2019 we carried out an exercise for M.Sc. students (a 50 in each year) involving the creation of fake accounts based on prescribed data. We mapped the developed skills and knowledge, analyzing the legal and ethical aspects of the process (also involving external experts, e.g. physical and cybersecurity specialists, lawyers, educational technologists). We conclude that fake accounts as a learning tool can be a powerful measure to activate new ways of `out of the box' thinking necessary for both cybersecurity experts and common citizens in an information society."

9582462,Model-based Attack Tree Generation for Cybersecurity Risk-Assessments in Automotive,"Networked and highly automated driver assistance systems require interfaces to the outside world and within the vehicle. These can potentially be used for cybersecurity attacks. Therefore, cybersecurity risk analyses are essential to adequately counter cybersecurity threats. Through UNECE Regulations No. 155, cybersecurity risk assessments, are mandatory for all new cars from 2024. The ISO/SAE 21434 standard “Road vehicles Cybersecurity engineering”, defines requirements for cybersecurity risk management with regard to electrical/electronic systems and components. In this context, it is imperative that possible attack paths are investigated. The creation of these attack paths is labor-intensive and should relate to the preliminary system architecture. Automatic attack tree generation could help to reduce the effort to create attack paths manually. This paper presents a new approach to generate relevant attack paths in a semi-automated way, taking the attack motivation and functional dependencies into account. This can shift the effort of creating attack trees in the concept phase to the preliminary system description and allows cybersecurity experts to focus more on aspects that require their creativity and expertise."

We further provide PACS specific Security Functional Requirements, and we conclude with a guideline for selecting suitable Security Assurance Requirements."
8666600,A System Architecture of Cybersecurity Information Exchange with Privacy (CYBEX-P),"Rapid evolution of cyber threats and recent trends in the increasing number of cyber-attacks call for adopting robust and agile cybersecurity techniques. Cybersecurity information sharing is expected to play an effective role in detecting and defending against new attacks. However, reservations and or-ganizational policies centering the privacy of shared data have become major setbacks in large-scale collaboration in cyber defense. The situation is worsened by the fact that the benefits of cyber-information exchange are not realized unless many actors participate. In this paper, we argue that privacy preservation of shared threat data will motivate entities to share threat data. Accordingly, we propose a framework called CYBersecurity information EXchange with Privacy (CYBEX-P) to achieve this. CYBEX-P is a structured information sharing platform with integrating privacy-preserving mechanisms. We propose a complete system architecture for CYBEX-P that guarantees maximum security and privacy of data. CYBEX-P outlines the details of a cybersecurity information sharing platform. The adoption of blind processing, privacy preservation, and trusted computing paradigms make CYBEX-P a versatile and secure information exchange platform."

9373127,Adversarial Teaching Approach to Cybersecurity: A Mathematical Model Explains Why It Works Well,"Teaching cybersecurity means teaching all possible ways how software can be attacked - and how to fight such attacks. From the usual pedagogical viewpoint, a natural idea seems to be to teach all these ways one by one. Surprisingly, a completely different approach works even better: when the class is divided into sparring mini-teams that try their best to attack each other and defend from each other. In spite of the lack of thoroughness, this approach generates good specialists - but why? In this paper, by analyzing a simple mathematical model of this situation, we explain why this approach work - and, moreover, we show that it is optimal in some reasonable sense."

8752904,Game Theoretic-Based Approaches for Cybersecurity-Aware Virtual Machine Placement in Public Cloud Clusters,"Allocating several Virtual Machines (VMs) onto a single server helps to increase cloud computing resource utilization and to reduce its operating expense. However, multiplexing VMs with different security levels on a single server gives rise to major VM-to-VM cybersecurity interdependency risks. In this paper, we address the problem of the static VM allocation with cybersecurity loss awareness by modeling it as a two-player zero-sum game between an attacker and a provider. We first obtain optimal solutions by employing the mathematical programming approach. We then seek to find the optimal solutions by quickly identifying the equilibrium allocation strategies in our formulated zero-sum game. We mean by ""equilibrium"" that none of the provider nor the attacker has any incentive to deviate from one's chosen strategy. Specifically, we study the characteristics of the game model, based on which, to develop effective and efficient allocation algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed cybersecurity-aware consolidation algorithms can significantly outperform the commonly used multi-dimensional bin packing approaches for large-scale cloud data centers."

Owing to its unique advantages, artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in cybersecurity and playing an increasingly important role. However, cybersecurity talents, especially those with AI skills (defined as AISec talents) are in short supply, and talents cultivation becomes a top priority. Cybersecurity competition is one of the most effective ways to identify talents. In order to reduce the gap between supply and demand of AISec talents, we investigate the existing cybersecurity competitions concerning AI applications in the paper. We summarize several existing forms of competing in cybersecurity competitions and discuss the ways AI impacts on cybersecurity. Based on the work of above, AI competitions in categories and how AI is applied in competitions are illustrated in detail. By analyzing and summarizing, we reveal the current problems and point out the direction for future competitions to better serve in talents cultivation and selection."
8971822,Demonstration of the Cybersecurity Framework through Real-World Cyber Attack,"The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity, provides five concurrent and continuous functions to Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover from cyber threats and vulnerabilities to buildings. Based on the core architecture and security best practices defined in the CSF guidelines, we developed the CSF webtools. The CSF webtools provide actionable functions that can be easily adopted by a facility operator to enhance their critical infrastructure security. The essence is captured in a set of “how-to” instructions for the facility operators to adopt, adapt, and apply to their critical infrastructure facilities. When considered together, these functions provide a high-level, strategic view of the lifecycle of an organization's cybersecurity risk management. The CSF webtools provide an easy to follow set of cybersecurity best practices, policies, and procedures to improve the cybersecurity posture of our nation's buildings and other critical infrastructures. The CSF webtools are also designed to facilitate communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across the organization from the executive to operations levels. Finally, the CSF webtools allow the critical infrastructure operators to assess the overall cybersecurity maturity and posture. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the capabilities of the CSF webtools through an illustrative cyber-attack based on a real-world scenario."
9060332,Veterans and Their Inherent Cybersecurity Preparedness: Myth or Reality?,"Increasingly, the cybersecurity job market is lacking in qualified talent. Although lack of available workers with the proper skills is part of it, it is primarily due to the increasing breadth of the cyber domain. To combat this, many companies and government agencies are looking to train combat veterans in the necessary skills to be effective and capable in the domain of cybersecurity. Combat veterans, who have experience with risk and adapting to difficult situations and unknown threats, are believed to be better suited than the civilian population to deal with the threat landscape of cybersecurity. The purpose of the research is to examine this preconceived notion through four overarching research questions: 1. Do combat veterans make better cybersecurity professionals? 2. How much does their experience with risk and threat assessment come into play? 3. Do veterans make better cybersecurity professionals for other reasons? 4. Or is the notion that vets make better cybersecurity professions flawed because the required skills are so technical in nature? As a precursor to a comprehensive study, a large-scale survey was conducted to see what differences, if any, there are between individuals with combat experience and those that do not have such experience. These results are discussed. Future research will employ a mixed methods design consisting of a general survey (phase I) followed by interviews with Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) (phase II), and finally interviews with Veterans and non-veterans (phase III). The phased approach will allow us to make the most efficient use of our time by using the information learned in one phase to help inform subsequent phases. This will result in a richer set of data and more meaningful results."
9345803,A Review of Cybersecurity Guidelines for Manufacturing Factories in Industry 4.0,"Industry 4.0 is a revolution in manufacturing by introducing disruptive technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-computing into the heart of the factory. The resulting increased automation and the improved production synergy between stocks, supply chains and customer demands, come along with the threats and attacks from the Internet. Despite extensive literature on the cybersecurity topic, many actors in manufacturing factories are just realizing the impact of cybersecurity in the preservation of their business. This paper introduces step-by-step the concepts and practical aspects of an Industry 4.0 manufacturing factory that are related to cybersecurity. Based on a subdivision of a typical factory into several generic perimeters, we present the vulnerabilities and threats regarding the network and devices usually found in each perimeter. Therefore, it is more efficient to present the recent proposals of the literature regarding cybersecurity guidelines and solutions in Industry 4.0. Instead of spreading a lot of references regarding every aspect of cybersecurity, we focused on a limited number of papers among the recent references. However, for each paper, we provide the details about the purpose of the proposal, the methodology adopted, the technical solution developed and its evaluation by the authors. These solutions range from classical cybersecurity countermeasures to innovative ones, such as those based on honeypots and digital twins. In order to deliver a review also useful to non scientists, we present our guidelines along with those of some organizations involved in cybersecurity harmonization and standardization in the world."
8725033,Analyzing Cybersecurity Job Market Needs in Morocco by Mining Job Ads,"Cybersecurity jobs are becoming more and more in demand for companies and governmental organizations, especially with the increasing number of cyber-threats in the world. In order to keep up with these changes, a study for the cybersecurity job market needs is required in order to help universities adapt their curricula and train more skilled graduates. However, most of prior work focuses on IT jobs and overlooks the cybersecurity field which makes the analysis of the needs of this field ambiguous. In this paper, we collect job ads from 9 Moroccan job portals from February 2017 to June 2018. After removing duplicates, we result in 409 job ads. Then, we split the data into two categories that are cybersecurity jobs and IT jobs that require cybersecurity. We use text analysis techniques to extract skills and requirements listed in these ads. More specifically, we extract the education level, programming languages, natural languages, years of experience, certifications and types of contract listed in these ads. Our paper finds that skills that are highly requested, such as risk analysis methods and certificates are not emphasized in cybersecurity-specific curriculum, while skills that are less in demand, such as a range of programming languages, are taught more regularly in universities. Additionally, more jobs require some understanding of English than of French, which was surprising given prevalence of French in Morocco. Our results can be used to reshape universities training in order to meet the demand of the job market."
9488211,On Aggregation and Prediction of Cybersecurity Incident Reports,"The study of cybersecurity incidents is an active research field. The purpose of this work is to determine accurate measures of cybersecurity incidents. An effective method to aggregate cybersecurity incident reports is defined to set these measures. As a result we are able to make predictions and, therefore, to deploy security policies. Forecasting time-series of those cybersecurity aggregates is performed based on Koopman's method and Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithm. Both techniques have shown to be accurate for a wide variety of dynamical systems ranging from fluid dynamics to social sciences. We have performed some experiments on public databases. We show that the measure of the risk trend can be effectively forecasted."
9629198,Cybersecurity issues in citizen science,"As Citizen Science projects become more wide-spread and global, we must pay attention to cybersecurity issues that can emerge. Sharing data is fundamental to Citizen Science projects, and that requires attention to protecting privacy. This issue is exacerbated if participants use common technologies, e.g., cell phones, that are used for other purposes and may be subject to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity issues can arise during recruitment, by which social media is a prevalent tool, to Citizen Science projects in that bad actors can solicit input into malicious and false projects. Furthermore, the results of Citizen Science projects may provide foundations for policy and legislation; thus, integrity must be maintained, and bad actors prevented from manipulating data and/or results. Governance of Citizen Science projects must include attention to cybersecurity issues, regardless of their scope and scale. The exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities is often the result of ethical lapses. Just as scientists respect science research ethics, so must citizens who undertake scientific research. In this paper, we will share a taxonomy that identifies how research ethics are represented and brought to life in 21st century Citizen Science projects."
9532042,A Threat Actions Extraction Method Based on The Conditional Co-occurrence Degree,"With a growing number of publications on threat intelligence information, it is inefficient to manually extract useful information from unstructured contexts. In order to help cybersecurity researchers have better understandings of the threat actions taken by attackers in cybersecurity incidents, this paper proposes a method to automatically extract multiple threat actions from cybersecurity incident reports based on the conditional co-occurrence degree. Firstly, the text is reconstructed into a set of co-occurrence words. Then Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is used to extract the topic words to calculate the semantic similarity between the documents and the threat actions, which is taken as the document features. Finally, the problem of threat actions extraction is transformed into multi-label classification problem, and several machine learning algorithms are used to complete the extraction of threat actions in articles related to cybersecurity events. The dataset consists of security-related articles from various authoritative threat intelligence publishing platforms. After a series of experiments, we compared the performance of the proposed method with the previous method. The experimental results show that the precision of the threat actions extraction method proposed in this paper is over 65%. Our method is applicable to threat intelligence extraction, and the introduction of co-occurrence words is also an innovation in the field of multi-label classification."
8886898,The CATS Hackathon: Creating and Refining Test Items for Cybersecurity Concept Inventories,"Presently, there is no rigorous, research-based method for measuring the quality of cybersecurity instruction. Validated assessment tools are needed so that cybersecurity educators have trusted methods for discerning whether efforts to improve student preparation are successful. The Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) Project 9 provides rigorous evidence-based instruments for assessing and evaluating educational practices (http://www.cisa.umbc.edu/cats/index.html). The first instrument is the Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI), which measures how well students understand core concepts in cybersecurity (especially adversarial thinking) after a first course in the field. The second instrument, the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA), measures how well students understand the same core concepts after completing a full cybersecurity curriculum and whether they are ready to enter the workforce as cybersecurity professionals. These tools can identify pedagogies and content that are effective in teaching cybersecurity."
9319018,Cybersecurity in Medical Private Practice: Results of a Survey in Audiology,"Despite well-documented cyber threats to patients' protected health information (PHI), sparse evidence exists about the state of cybersecurity behavior of health care workers and medical private practices. There is evidence of insecure behavior in hospital settings, even though specific insights about private practice are still absent. In addition to mandatory standards for securing PHI, such as the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA), small business viability and their patients' security and privacy are critically dependent upon technology availability and reliability. In this survey of 131 clinical audiologists we show that many lack time, staff expertise, or funds to deploy adequate cybersecurity that prevents and mitigates threats to security and privacy. We find widespread deployment of HIPAA-compliant cybersecurity, including antivirus software and individual logins. Only 9.9% of participants reported at least one data breach in 2019, significantly less than the average for small businesses and health care providers, and only 24.4% reported having cyber insurance. Practice owners view patient data as well protected and unlikely victims for cyber attacks and breaches. These results have important implications for cybersecurity products and services, and to medical professionals who must acknowledge the acute importance of cybersecurity in securing protected health information and mitigating risks. Small business private practice health care providers who are particularly sensitive to the impacts of cyber attacks and must prioritize and adopt countermeasures that decrease the risks to patients and their own businesses."
9031164,BloCyNfo-Share: Blockchain based Cybersecurity Information Sharing with Fine Grained Access Control,"To build a proactive cyber defense system, sharing the cybersecurity information has been very popular by which any organization can get more information about unknown and new threats. Cybersecurity Information Exchange (CYBEX) is one of the important platforms which has been playing an important role in implementing proactive cyber defense system by allowing organizations sharing their cybersecurity information. However, they are centralized and therefore they may suffer from complete failure in case of any damage or accident. Moreover, while sharing private information it lacks the mechanism of providing rights to query organizations i.e., enabling the access control over the shared sensitive information. Finally, nonrepudiation of the system does not exist i.e., there is no way to track or keep the record what any organization is sharing and it is necessary to keep the record in case anyone denies after sharing false information. To address these issues, in this paper we propose blockchain based privacy preserving cybersecurity information sharing using proxy re-encryption and attribute-based encryption (BloCyNfo-Share) where the organization can achieve fine-grain access control by delegating which organization can have the access to its cybersecurity information leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology. We conduct privacy and experimental analysis of the proposed system and the findings show that the model is private as well as efficient."
8972000,Recommended Functionalities for Improving Cybersecurity of Distributed Energy Resources,"The current electric grid is transitioning through increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), which include intermittent renewable generation resources on the distribution side. Both the monitoring and control of DERs require extensive data-exchange and communication networks. These networks lead to cyber vulnerabilities and risks of new kinds of cyberattacks that may be extremely destructive for power system operations. Although current standards, such as IEEE Std. 1547-2018, do not discuss cybersecurity measures for DERs, cybersecurity controls should be developed for securing DER systems at the device level, communications level, and applications level. This paper discusses the current industry's best practices related to DER cybersecurity and proposes recommended functionalities for improving the cybersecurity posture of DERs, specifically at the device/distribution level. These practical recommendations have been discussed and verified with the industry through a DER cybersecurity working group."
9527908,SoK: Autonomic Cybersecurity - Securing Future Disruptive Technologies,"This paper is a systemization of knowledge of autonomic cybersecurity. Disruptive technologies, such as IoT, AI and autonomous systems, are becoming more prevalent and often have little or no cybersecurity protections. This lack of security is contributing to the expanding cybersecurity attack surface. The autonomic computing initiative was started to address the complexity of administering complex computing systems by making them self-managing. Autonomic systems contain attributes to address cyberattacks, such as self-protecting and self-healing that can secure new technologies. There has been a number of research projects on autonomic cybersecurity, with different approaches and target technologies, many of them disruptive. This paper reviews autonomic computing, analyzes research on autonomic cybersecurity, and provides a systemization of knowledge of the research. The paper concludes with identification of gaps in autonomic cybersecurity for future research."
9515166,Investigating Potential Barriers to Cybersecurity Risk Management Investment in SMEs,"Ignoring the importance of cybersecurity risk management in SMEs became an issue among decision-makers. Lack of strategic investment decision by SMEs could lead to further risks and vulnerabilities. The significant increase of cybersecurity threats might become a very difficult task for both SMEs and other parties in the future. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential barriers to cybersecurity risk management investment in SMEs based on conducting several interviews with decision-makers in the sector to understand the causes of this prevention. The authors aim to reveal the role the SMEs’ decision-makers are playing in addressing cybersecurity risks in recent years and to suggest avenues for further research. The paper follows a qualitative exploratory approach to identify those potential barriers. Starting with an invitation are distributed by e-mail, phone call, or social medial account, to hundreds of Saudi’s decision-makers in the SMEs sector, asking them to participate in this study. As a result, 20 participants from various SMEs business sectors have agreed to participate. Therefore, six potential barriers that play a key role in the prevention of cybersecurity risk management investment in SMEs, which are the financial capacity, the lack of awareness, the size of SMEs, the traditional commerce, the absence of risk standards, and the over-confidence of decision-makers. Some of these barriers impacts have been discussed before in different contexts. Yet, this study investigates these barriers impact on preventing SMEs from investing in CRM. Also, to the best of authors knowledge, none of previous research has combined these barriers together with an insight to measure their effect on managerial decision-making. Further research on cybersecurity risk management in SMEs is needed."

8963730,Harnessing Artificial Intelligence Capabilities to Improve Cybersecurity,"Cybersecurity is a fast-evolving discipline that is always in the news over the last decade, as the number of threats rises and cybercriminals constantly endeavor to stay a step ahead of law enforcement. Over the years, although the original motives for carrying out cyberattacks largely remain unchanged, cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated with their techniques. Traditional cybersecurity solutions are becoming inadequate at detecting and mitigating emerging cyberattacks. Advances in cryptographic and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (in particular, machine learning and deep learning) show promise in enabling cybersecurity experts to counter the ever-evolving threat posed by adversaries. Here, we explore AI's potential in improving cybersecurity solutions, by identifying both its strengths and weaknesses. We also discuss future research opportunities associated with the development of AI techniques in the cybersecurity field across a range of application domains."
9233955,A Study of Chinese Policy Attention on Cybersecurity,"The rising number of cyberattacks and cybercriminals around the world has put major threats on the cybersecurity and even the national security of many countries. In response, governments started to introduce policies and regulations to improve cybersecurity. It is increasingly realized that effective cybersecurity policy making largely depends upon optimized policy attention and the effective use of public resources. This article draws on the “attention-driven policy choice model” and the punctuated equilibrium theory to analyze the relationship between policy attention allocation, policy agenda setting, and the choice of policy tools in different periods of cybersecurity development. Using Chinese cybersecurity development as the main context, content analysis of policy texts was conducted to examine the pathway of cybersecurity policy development in China between 1994 and 2019. The findings suggest that there is evidence for punctuated equilibrium with policy stagnation and incrementality being broken up by major events which shift policy attention and subsequently affects agenda setting and the choice of policy tools. The findings of this article will provide important implications for the development of strategic foresight of cybersecurity and the effective use of public resources to improve cybersecurity."

9092037,UAE Cybersecurity Perception and Risk Assessments Compared to Other Developed Nations,"Understanding perception and risk behavior of citizens in a particular country can influence policies that leads to creation of appropriate cyber laws that guarantees citizens' security and privacy in cyber related transactions. UAE cyber activity and perception data is compared with data from nine developed nations. Results obtained have shown that with respect to monetary loss due to cybercrime versus relative risk, UAE is at par with Canada. Combination of results obtained suggests a need for aggressive promotion of cybersecurity awareness program in UAE. Although digital maturity, access to Internet and cybersecurity awareness in UAE may be low compared to other developed nations, cyber risk behavior is comparatively the same as in other nine developed nations. One major contribution of this research is that methodologies are presented that can be used in developing cybersecurity assessment of cybersecurity risk behaviors, and comparison of cyber related risk behavior among countries."
9225942,Analysis of Learning Modalities Towards Effective Undergraduate Cybersecurity Education Design,"Cybersecurity education is a critical component of today's computer science and IT curriculum. To provide for a highly effective cybersecurity education, we propose using machine-learning techniques to identify common learning modalities of cybersecurity students in order to optimize how cybersecurity core topics, threats, tools and techniques are taught. We test various hypothesis, e.g. that students of selected VARK learning styles will outperform their peers. The results indicate that for the class assignments in our study preference of read/write and kinesthetic modalities yielded the best results. This further indicates that specific learning instruments can be tailored for students based on their individual VARK learning styles."
9229727,Tech Pains: Characterizations of Lived Cybersecurity Experiences,"The permeation of technology into every facet of life has profoundly shifted the nature and ramifications of cybersecurity incidents. As a consequence, a complete and refined characterization of these adverse events necessitates a sociotechnical approach that takes into account the subjective lived experiences of the victims. Although researchers have examined such experiences pertaining to specific types of incidents, a broad understanding of the harmful impact of cybersecurity incidents requires an investigation of how people characterize and cope with these adverse experiences in general. To that end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 individuals who reported a variety of cybersecurity incidents, consequences, and coping mechanisms. We found that the experiences can be characterized along a bounded to fuzzy spectrum. As the majority of current cybersecurity efforts focus on relatively bounded incidents, we make the case that fuzzy incidents deserve similar attention because their harmful impacts are deeper and longer-lasting. Our insight can be applied to improve and personalize the delivery of cybersecurity interventions."
9075068,Digital Simulation in the Virtual World: Its Effect in the Knowledge and Attitude of Students Towards Cybersecurity,"The search for alternative delivery modes to teaching has been one of the pressing concerns of numerous educational institutions. One key innovation to improve teaching and learning is e-learning which has undergone enormous improvements. From its focus on text-based environment, it has evolved into Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) which provide more stimulating and immersive experiences among learners and educators. An example of VLEs is the virtual world which is an emerging educational platform among universities worldwide. One very interesting topic that can be taught using the virtual world is cybersecurity. Simulating cybersecurity in the virtual world may give a realistic experience to students which can be hardly achieved by classroom teaching. To date, there are quite a number of studies focused on cybersecurity awareness and cybersecurity behavior. But none has focused looking into the effect of digital simulation in the virtual world, as a new educational platform, in the cybersecurity attitude of the students. It is in this regard that this study has been conducted by designing simulation in the virtual world lessons that teaches the five aspects of cybersecurity namely; malware, phishing, social engineering, password usage and online scam, which are the most common cybersecurity issues. The study sought to examine the effect of this digital simulation design in the cybersecurity knowledge and attitude of the students. The result of the study ascertains that students exposed under simulation in the virtual world have a greater positive change in cybersecurity knowledge and attitude than their counterparts."
9247722,Cybersecurity Impact over Bigdata and IoT Growth,"Big Data and IoT based applications are promising and being necessary for almost all the fields. IoT applications provide us with beneficial services, and also they gather and transmit data to Big Data databases where data can be stored and analyzed. Big Data and IoT started to be involved in smart homes, smart healthcare, education, shopping and even in agriculture field. These Big Data and IoT based applications are growing rapidly. The more these technologies are giving us great applications and making our life better; the more cybersecurity attacks start against them. These applications are the target for attackers due to the useful and massive amount of data they have. Cybersecurity is a significant issue for these technologies. Cybersecurity threats and attacks can stop these technologies from growing, which is considered to be a negative point for us and these promising technologies. Cybersecurity threats weaken these technologies to gain full access over the user's data. Understanding the possible applications and benefits that we could learn from these technologies is important Also, understanding and being aware of the possible threats that could threaten the various Big Data and IoT based applications is more critical Understanding the possible cybersecurity attacks and threats can help us to know about how to protect these technologies and applications from cybersecurity attacks. This research presents critical cybersecurity impacts in the form of security threats, and attacks that could be initiated against Big Data and IoT based applications and affect their growth. These impacts are elaborated using a case study of a healthcare system with its possible cybersecurity attacks, which shows the relation between cybersecurity attacks and the growth of Big Data and IoT technologies."
9092220,On Cybersecurity Education for Non-technical Learners,"In this paper the topic of cybersecurity education for individuals who are not in a technical learning environment will be explored. There are currently several organizations that can certify an education program that is focused on cybersecurity or similar areas. However, for individuals who are not within the cybersecurity field, such as those who are not yet finished with their high school education, those who are within another discipline at the University or College level, or those who are outside of the education system entirely, then there is no such entities or guidelines for programs to inform them about cybersecurity and privacy related issues and topics. This does not mean though, that these individuals have any less of a need for some training in the basics of cybersecurity and privacy protection that will affect everyone's daily life. Since these individuals are not exposed to the curriculums that might enable them to recognize or gain an understanding of the reasons behind practices that are common place for everyone, such as password requirements, then there could be an even greater need for them to be exposed to it in a controlled and consistent manner. The need to understand the security and privacy concerns associated with using various services and devices will continue to increase as more devices become internet and network connected, more jobs increasingly rely on technology, and more of these connected devices are brought into homes."

8925257,Cybersecurity Risk Assessment for California's Smart Inverter Functions,"The increased proliferation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) has made a new approach to distribution system planning necessary. California's Rule 21 stipulates the requirements for connecting generators to the distribution grid. Power electronics are instrumental in making these interconnections possible, converting electric power and energy into several forms and magnitudes. Power electronics also facilitate the control of distributed generation and storage assets. Inverters are prominent power electronics found in many customer premises because of their pertinence in converting electricity from DC to AC. Smart inverters go beyond basic conversion and have the potential to support the utility system. The additional grid support function creates some cyber security vulnerabilities, especially when the grid relies on inverter-dependent DER in high proliferation areas. In California., the Smart Inverter Working Group (SIWG) provided smart inverter functionality recommendations in three interrelated and interdependent phases. Both phase 1 and phase 3 functions are expected to comply with phase 2 communications requirements. This paper explores the risks associated with all phases of the SIWG Smart Inverter functions. We will consider current industry standards applicable to smart inverter communications such as the IEEE 2030.5 Implementation Guide for Smart Inverters."

9379762,Smart Inverter Communication Model and Impact of Cybersecurity Attack,"Increasing penetration of inverter based distributed renewable energy resources poses many challenges for stable grid operation. Smart Inverters (SI) offers some potential support to the grid operation. SI can provide voltage or frequency support to the grid. To realize the full potential of these benefits SIs must operate in coordination with Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS). The coordinated operation of SIs and DERMS can only realized through a standardized and interoperable communication. This paper presents IEC 61850 based communication model for SIs. Furthermore, the IEC 61850 message exchanges required for SI operation, i.e. defining and enabling different operating curves, is implemented in laboratory using IEC 61850 emulation tools. Furthermore, the vulnerability of SI standardized communication to cyberattacks and its impact on distribution performance is showcased."

9635693,Information Systems Sourcing Strategies and Organizational Cybersecurity Breaches,"This article compares the impacts of various information systems (IS) sourcing strategies on organizational cybersecurity breaches. Through a longitudinal empirical analysis, we found that when the organization has a narrower spread of IT applications, a best of breed (BoB) strategy is less likely to cause cybersecurity breaches than a single-sourcing approach; and the difference is decreasing as its IT application spread increases. The insourcing strategy has shown a lower likelihood of organizational cybersecurity breaches than any outsourcing strategy [i.e., single-sourcing, best of suite (BoS), and BoB], which is weakened by the organization's IT application spread and is significant only when the IT application spread is relatively low. A BoS strategy has an insignificant difference in cybersecurity breaches compared to the BoB approach. However, for organizations with a broader spread of IT applications, there is no significant difference among all sourcing strategies on the likelihood of cybersecurity breaches. This research provides theoretical and practical implications for organizational cybersecurity management in IS development and interorganizational relationships."
9269037,SecBot: a Business-Driven Conversational Agent for Cybersecurity Planning and Management,"Businesses were moving during the past decades to-ward full digital models, which made companies face new threats and cyberattacks affecting their services and, consequently, their profits. To avoid negative impacts, companies' investments in cybersecurity are increasing considerably. However, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) operate on small budgets, minimal technical expertise, and few personnel to address cybersecurity threats. In order to address such challenges, it is essential to promote novel approaches that can intuitively present cybersecurity-related technical information.This paper introduces SecBot, a cybersecurity-driven conversational agent (i.e., chatbot) for the support of cybersecurity planning and management. SecBot applies concepts of neural networks and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to interact and extract information from a conversation. SecBot can (a) identify cyberattacks based on related symptoms, (b) indicate solutions and configurations according to business demands, and (c) provide insightful information for the decision on cybersecurity investments and risks. A formal description had been developed to describe states, transitions, a language, and a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementation. A case study and a performance evaluation were conducted to provide evidence of the proposed solution's feasibility and accuracy."

The IoT is not only connecting computer and mobile devices, it also interconnects smart homes, buildings, companies and cities.With increased deployment of IoT devices in domestic smart home environment, the threats and challenges also need to be addressed in order to improve and build a secure and resilient cybersecurity based IoT smart infrastructure. Moreover, IoT smart environment tackles more security issues than traditional computer networks usually do. While many researchers are trying to explore the security challenges and open problems in smart home based IoT infrastructure, there is a lack of a systematic study of the security challenges in the IoT cybersecurity landscape. However, Smart home environment and IoT services will introduce significant security challenges due to the substantial increase in the number of computing resources, attack surface, communications infrastructure and attack rates. In this paper, we intent to fulfil this gap by executing the IoT cybersecurity-based attacks to detect the most critical attacks for smart home IoT end devices. At the same time, we present our intrusion prevention system methodology in order to protect the affected system from future attacks."
9383723,Using Deep Learning For Assessing Cybersecurity Economic Risks In Virtual Power Plants,"This paper presents an assessment procedure for evaluating economic risks in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) using two deep learning techniques, viz., Naïve Bayes algorithm and J48 bagging tree model. A comprehensive matrix of cybersecurity economic assessment based on threats, motives, impacts, challenges and economic impacts is provided in this paper. Cybersecurity risk quantification and their measurement and Cyber risk mitigation frameworks are also dealt with in this paper. Our cybersecurity risk Return On Security Investment (ROSI) model employs 9-parameters, while our dataset collection is classified into 11 types of attack profiles. The results obtained from Naïve Bayes classifier and CRQ using J48 bagging tree model yield a predictor accuracy of 82%, while the classifier correctly classifies instances in Naïve Bayes with a Receiver-Operator-Characteristic (ROC) area of 0.940 indicating the good classification of the sampled data; the prediction rate is 94.2% for the CRQ-J48. The ROC curve for the naïve Bayes classifier performs its best when the data is at 80% and performs worse when at 10%. Similarly, the J48 performs best when the data is at 85%-90% and worse between 5%-10%. While examining the cost of the data breach of a single instance of compromise, it can be estimated that web server has the maximum exposure and hence the cost of a breach is approximately estimated to be around 19 million dollars in our dataset."
9626339,Sec4ML: An approach to support Cybersecurity Data Publishing for Machine Learning tasks,"Despite the exponential growth of the World Wide Web since its creation, there are still few available datasets of cybersecurity incidents to be reused due to several issues, such as privacy-preserving concerns and data publication format standardization. As a result, the domain incidents analysis are precarious impacting on the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) development. The LOD (Linked Open Data) practices, which allows the sharing of data on the Web as a large and interconnected data graph, together with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, which guides the publication of data for reuse, can support the sharing of cybersecurity incidents datasets. Furthermore, anonymization techniques can be used to handle privacy concerns. Moreover, Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to improve IDS effectiveness. This article proposes the Sec4ML approach which supports the preparation of cybersecurity incident datasets for ML techniques using LOD practices and following FAIR principles, involving, among others, anonymization and preprocessing subprocesses, which are illustrated using data extracted from the UNSW-NB15 dataset."
8766805,Self-Service Cybersecurity Monitoring as Enabler for DevSecOps,"Current IoT systems are highly distributed systems that integrate cloud, edge, and fog computing approaches depending on where intelligence and processing capabilities are allocated. This distribution and heterogeneity make development and deployment pipelines very complex and fragmented with multiple delivery endpoints above hardware. This fact prevents rapid development and makes the operation and monitoring of production systems a difficult and tedious task, including cybersecurity event monitoring. The DevSecOps can be defined as a cultural approach to improve and accelerate the delivery of business value by making dev/sec/ops teams' collaboration effective. This paper focuses on self-service cybersecurity monitoring as an enabler to introduce security practices in a DevOps environment. To that end, we have defined and formalized an activity that supports `Fast and Continuous Feedback from Ops to Dev' by providing a flexible monitoring infrastructure so that teams can configure their monitoring and alerting services according to their criteria (you build, you run, and now you monitor) to obtain fast and continuous feedback from the operation and thus, better anticipate problems when a production deployment is performed. This activity has been formalized using the Software & Systems Process Engineering Metamodel by OMG and its instantiation is described through a case study that shows the versioned and repeatable configuration of a cybersecurity monitoring infrastructure (Monitoring as Code) through virtualization and containerization technology. This self-service monitoring/alerting allows breaking silos between dev, ops, and sec teams by opening access to key security metrics, which enables a sharing culture and continuous improvement."
9582702,Enhancing Situational Awareness for Tutors of Cybersecurity Capture the Flag Games,"Supervised Capture the Flag games represent a popular method of practical hands-on training in cybersecurity education. However, as cybersecurity training sessions are process-oriented, tutors have only a limited insight into what trainees are doing and how they deal with the tasks. From their perspective, it is necessary to have situational awareness, enabling them to identify and react to any issues during a training session as soon as they emerge. We propose a tool designed in collaboration with cybersecurity educators. Based on user requirements, we developed the Progress Visualization Tool, which provides educators with timely feedback through the session. More specifically, the tool informs educators of the training progression, helps identify the students who might struggle with their tasks, and reveals overall deviation from the schedule. We validated the tool through formative and summative qualitative in-lab evaluations. The participants appraised the impact on the training workflow and gave further insights regarding the tool. We discuss the insights and recommendations that arose from the evaluations as they could aid the design of future tools for supporting educators, not only of CTFs but also in other domains."
9217053,Fuzzy-based Cybersecurity Risk Analysis of the Human Factor from the Perspective of Classified Information Leakage,"Nowadays, the digital transformation of organizations is not a challenge but a must-have. In the spring of 2020, practically the whole world worked from home offices. Now digital adaptation is the challenge for many people and orgaization. This situation poses challenges for the cybersecurity world. At the time of writing this article, there is no exact data yet on what cybersecurity incidents have occurred or how much damage they have caused. Nevertheless, it is certain that in the pandemic chaos, many corporates made mistakes during their digital adaptation processes. To a considerable extent, these mistakes are due to humans. Even though there are outstanding technological solutions or regulations at a company, if this riskfactor is not appropriately managed, then the other two are worthless. Despite the need, there is no widespread human risk anylisys method in cybersecurity, because it is difficult to measure, and covered in obscurity. In this paper, the authors propose a fuzzy model to organizations whereby they can measure this risk if they have sufficient information about the workforce. The model will be easier understood if presented through a specific threat, the digital leakage of classified information from a critical infrastructure."

9583706,Using Cyber Digital Twins for Automated Automotive Cybersecurity Testing,"Cybersecurity testing of automotive systems has become a practical necessity, with the wide adoption of advanced driving assistance functions and vehicular communications. These functionalities require the integration of information and communication technologies that not only allow for a plethora of on-the-fly configuration abilities, but also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses circumstances have also been recognized by standardization and regulation bodies, making the need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also proving the effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques. The approach is intended to generate meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-to-zero a priori knowledge."

9453894,Teaching Team Collaboration in Cybersecurity: A Case Study from the Transactive Memory Systems Perspective,"Recent trends in the cybersecurity workforce have recognized that effective solutions for complex problems require collective efforts from individuals with diverse sets of knowledge, skills, and abilities. Therefore, the growing need to train students in team collaboration skills propelled educators in computer science and engineering to adopt team-based pedagogical strategies. Team-based pedagogy has shown success in enhancing students' knowledge in course subjects and their motivation in learning. However, it is limited in offering concrete frameworks specifically focusing on how to teach team collaboration skills. As part of an interdisciplinary effort, we draw on Transactive Memory Systems Theory-a communication theory that explains how individuals in groups learn who knows what and organize who does what-in developing a Team Knowledge Sharing Assignment as a tool for student teams to structure their team collaboration processes. This paper reports a result of a case study in designing and facilitating the assignment for cybersecurity students enrolled in a scholarship program. Students' evaluations and the instructor's assessment reveal that the assignment made a positive impact on students' team collaboration skills by helping them successfully identify their team members' expertise and capitalize on their team's knowledge resources when delegating functional roles. Based on this case study, we offer practical suggestions on how the assignment could be used for various classes or cybersecurity projects and how instructors could maximize its benefits."

9394341,Adaptive Machine learning: A Framework for Active Malware Detection,"Applications of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in cybersecurity provide significant performance enhancement over traditional rule-based algorithms. These intelligent cyber-security solutions demand careful integration of the learning algorithms to develop a significant cyber incident detection system to formulate security analysts' industrial level. The development of advanced malware programs poses a critical threat to cybersecurity systems. Hence, an efficient, robust, and scalable malware recognition module is essential for every cybersecurity product. Conventional Signature-based methods struggle in terms of robustness and effectiveness during malware detection, specifically in the case of zero-day and polymorphic viruses attacks. In this paper, we design an adaptive Machine Learning based active malware detection framework which provides a cybersecurity solution against phishing attacks. The proposed framework utilize ML algorithms in a multilayered feed-forwarding approach to successfully detect the malware by examining the static features of the web pages. The proposed framework successfully extracts the features from the web pages and performs a successful detection process for the phishing attack. In the multilayered feed-forwarding framework, the first layer utilizes Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVN), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifiers to build a model for detecting malware from the real-time input. The output of the first layer passes to the Ensemble Voting (EV) algorithm, which accumulates earlier classifiers' performance. At the third layer, adaptive frameworks investigate second layer input data and formulate the phishing detection model. We analyze the proposed framework's performance on three different phishing datasets and validate the higher accuracy rate."
9028407,A UK Case Study on Cybersecurity Education and Accreditation,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a national case study-based analysis of the numerous dimensions to cybersecurity education and how they are prioritised, implemented and accredited; from understanding the interaction of hardware and software, moving from theory to practice (and vice versa), to human factors, policy and politics (as well as various other important facets). A multitude of model curricula and recommendations have been presented and discussed in international fora in recent years, with varying levels of impact on education, policy and practice. This paper address three key questions: i) what is taught and what should be taught for cybersecurity to general computer science students; ii) should cybersecurity be taught stand-alone or in an integrated manner to general computer science students; and iii) can accreditation by national professional, statutory and regulatory bodies enhance the provision of cybersecurity within a body's jurisdiction? Evaluating how cybersecurity is taught in all aspects of computer science is clearly a task of considerable size, one that is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead a case study-based research approach - primarily focusing on the UK - has been adopted to evaluate the evidence of the teaching of cybersecurity within general computer science to university-level students. Thus, in the context of widespread international computer science/engineering curriculum reform, what does this need to embed cybersecurity knowledge and skills mean more generally for institutions and educators, and how can we teach this subject more effectively? Through this UK case study, and by contrasting with related initiatives in the US, we demonstrate the positive effect that national accreditation requirements can have, and offer some recommendations both for future research and curriculum developments."

A versatile workbook model has been explored, which proves to be adaptable to serve a wide range of cases for successfully managing government and private sector security operations center. Cybersecurity incident sharing partnership, formalism for metric and measurements of cybersecurity incident parameters, and cybersecurity incident classification and prioritization schemes are presented, and finally, cybersecurity incident “plays” and playbook templates are discussed."
9517068,"Cybersecurity in Robotics: Challenges, Quantitative Modeling, and Practice","act:
Robotics is becoming more and more ubiquitous, but the pressure to bring systems to market occasionally goes at the cost of neglecting security mechanisms during the development, deployment or while in production. As a result, contemporary robotic systems are vulnerable to diverse attack patterns, and a posteriori hardening is at least challenging, if not impossible at all. This book aims to stipulate the inclusion of security in robotics from the earliest design phases onward and with a special focus on the cost-benefit tradeoff that can otherwise be an inhibitor for the fast development of affordable systems. We advocate quantitative methods of security management and design, covering vulnerability scoring systems tailored to robotic systems, and accounting for the highly distributed nature of robots as an interplay of potentially very many components. A powerful quantitative approach to model-based security is offered by game theory, providing a rich spectrum of techniques to optimize security against various kinds of attacks. Such a multi-perspective view on security is necessary to address the heterogeneity and complexity of robotic systems. This book is intended as an accessible starter for the theoretician and practitioner working in the field."

9336084,The Challenges of Software Cybersecurity Certification [Building Security In],"In 2019, the new European Union (EU) cybersecurity regulation ""Cybersecurity Act"" (""CSA"")1 entered into force to create a common framework for the certification of any information and communication technology (ICT) system, including products, services, and processes. The main purpose of this framework is to reduce the current fragmentation of cybersecurity certification schemes2 as well as to increase end users? trust in a hyperconnected society3 by fostering a mutual recognition of certified ICT components in any EU country."
9620717,Changing the Game: Adapting Capture the Flag To Underrepresented Groups,"Capture the Flag (CTF) contests have become popular in the cybersecurity community to display and cultivate skills related to cybersecurity. Professionals within the cybersecurity community participate in them to claim “bragging” rights, conferences use them as a hands-on workshop activity, and universities sponsor them to build interest in cybersecurity. Skill in navigating a CTF contest is a source of prestige, and infers cybersecurity skills. The traditional cybersecurity CTF game uses a competitive context rather than cooperative. Competitors is may work alone or form teams. Games and other technology design are noted for reflecting the creators. Since the majority of cybersecurity professionals and academics are non-diverse, the games they create reflect their cultural bias. One of the ways to reach underrepresented groups, such as women and minorities, is provide learning options that reduce cultural bias. If the major learning option in cybersecurity is CTF games that reflect a traditional cultural bias, underrepresented groups are at a disadvantage. With this in mind, this research developed a game framework designed for the participants to build an original Capture the Flag. The game framework removes the need for designers to build game functionality, while still retaining full control over the content. Consequently, the Capture the Flag challenges can reflect the interests and cultural background of any group of designers. In addition to the game play and the opportunity to tailor content, the framework also tracks how effective the challenges from the various design teams are based on the interaction of the participants with those challenges."

In order to ensure the universality of methods for investigating cybercrimes, which would allow them to be investigated regardless of the country of commission. This paper discusses the main cybersecurity threats in 2021 and the main directions of cybersecurity in the world."
9508261,Cybersecurity: Perceived Threats and Policy Responses in the Gulf Cooperation Council,"The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a political and economic union of the Arab states, comprising some of the fastest growing economies in the world due to the prevalence of oil and gas industry and more recently due to significant investments in the digital economy. However, in recent years, rates of cybercrime and cyber-threats have risen significantly, posing challenges to the security and economic performance of the region. This article deals with the necessity to engage in transnational cooperation to counter the complex challenges posed by cybercrime across the GCC. Interviews were held with members of the GCC political elite who hold expertise in cybersecurity affairs. An analysis is presented of cybersecurity threats in the region, problems of strategic cooperation and lack of dialogue to tackle common challenges in the areas of cybercrime and cybersecurity. Finally, specific aspects of GCC cybersecurity policy are discussed: preventive and mitigation actions; potential intraregional and international cooperation avenues; and the formulation of effective strategy to enhance cybersecurity capabilities and resilience. Although grounded in the GCC as a regional bloc, the findings also carry implications for other contexts, especially other Middle East and North Africa countries and, thus, represent a promising avenue for future research."
9637052,Toolset for Collecting Shell Commands and Its Application in Hands-on Cybersecurity Training,"This Full Paper in the Innovative Practice category presents and evaluates a technical innovation for hands-on classes. When learning cybersecurity, operating systems, or networking, students perform practical tasks using a broad range of command-line tools. Collecting and analyzing data about the command usage can reveal valuable insights into how students progress and where they make mistakes. However, few learning environments support recording and inspecting command-line inputs, and setting up an efficient infrastructure for this purpose is challenging. To aid engineering and computing educators, we share the design and implementation of an open-source toolset for logging commands that students execute on Linux machines. Compared to basic solutions, such as shell history files, the toolset's novelty and added value are threefold. First, its configuration is automated so that it can be easily used in classes on different topics. Second, it collects metadata about the command execution, such as a timestamp, hostname, and IP address. Third, all data are instantly forwarded to central storage in a unified, semi-structured format. This enables automated processing of the data, both in real-time and post hoc, to enhance the instructors' understanding of student actions. The toolset works independently of the teaching content, the training network's topology, or the number of students working in parallel. We demonstrated the toolset's value in two learning environments at four training sessions. Over two semesters, 50 students played educational cybersecurity games using a Linux command-line interface. Each training session lasted approximately two hours, during which we recorded 4439 shell commands. The semiautomated data analysis revealed different solution patterns, used tools, and misconceptions of students. Our insights from creating the toolset and applying it in teaching practice are relevant for instructors, researchers, and developers of learning environments....

9540950,Evaluating the Performance of NIST’s Framework Cybersecurity Controls Through a Constructivist Multicriteria Methodology,"This paper aims to show how creating a risk plan can be solved with the help of the constructivist multicriteria method. A case study using Multicriteria Decision Aid Constructivist (MCDA-C) was applied, with cybersecurity framework’s controls as a reference. The study was conducted in a large Brazilian bank in Brazil. The relevance of this work is the need to show that the application of multicriteria methods can be applied in the context of information security, which recommends the use of such methods to assist in risk analysis. The methodology used in this study was both quantitative and qualitative, obtaining primary data through brainstorming with decision-makers and forms answered by experts. The secondary data were obtained through the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, created by NIST - the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States. The problem was structured according to the constructivist method, and the data collected were processed and calculated. The study concluded that the category of Security Continuous Monitoring controls stood out compared to other categories. It also shows the importance of applying the constructivist method for the management of cyber risks by unravelling a problem and providing a basis for decision making. Our work contributes to a better understanding of risk management, encouraging the adoption of the constructivist method as a form of risk management best practice."
9280482,Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Augmentation and Embedding Improvement - A Healthcare Usecase,"The implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in medical environments, has introduced a growing list of security vulnerabilities and threats. The lack of an extensible big data resource that captures medical device vulnerabilities limits the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based cyber defense systems in capturing, detecting, and preventing known and future attacks. We describe a system that generates a repository of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) about various medical devices and their known vulnerabilities from sources such as manufacturer and ICS-CERT vulnerability alerts. We augment the intelligence repository with data sources such as Wikidata and public medical databases. The combined resources are integrated with threat intelligence in our Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG) from previous research. The augmented graph embeddings are useful in querying relevant information and can help in various AI assisted cybersecurity tasks. Given the integration of multiple resources, we found the augmented CKG produced higher quality graph representations. The augmented CKG produced a 31% increase in the Mean Average Precision (MAP) value, computed over an information retrieval task."
9224932,Hardware-based Capture-The-Flag Challenges,"In a world where cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important and where the lack of workforce is estimated in terms of millions of people, gamification is getting a more and more significant role in leading to excellent results in terms of both training and recruitment. Within cybersecurity gamification, the so-called Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenges are definitely the corner stones, as proved by the high number of events, competitions, and training courses that rely on them. In these events, the participants are confronted directly with games and riddles related to practical problems of hacking, cyber-attack, and cyber-defense. Although hardware security and hardware-based security already play a key role in the cybersecurity arena, in the worldwide panorama of CTF events hardware-based challenges are unfortunately still very marginal. In the present paper, we focus on hardware-based challenges, providing first a formal definition and then proposing, for the first time, a comprehensive taxonomy. We eventually share experiences gathered in preparing and delivering several hardware-based challenges in significant events and training courses that involved hundreds of attendees."
9174388,Opportunities and Challenges of Data-Driven Cybersecurity for Smart Cities,"To enhance the quality of life for city residents, ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is used along with additional new technologies to create smart cities. Smart cities also facilitate efficient utilization of the city resources and improve adaptability and sustainability. There are different applications supporting smart cities for smart energy systems, smart water networks, smart transportation systems, smart healthcare and smart public safety and security. While these applications provide several benefits, cybersecurity threats can be a major obstacle in realizing these benefits. In this study, we review the cybersecurity challenges in smart city applications. Then, we investigate using a data-driven cybersecurity approach to protect smart city applications. We identify and discuss the opportunities and challenges of utilizing the data-driven approach. Currently there are research efforts and publications discussing cybersecurity issues in smart city applications. However, none of them focus on data-driven cybersecurity approaches. Therefore, the main contributions of this paper include identifying potential smart city applications, identifying and discussion the benefits and opportunities of using the data-driven approach and outlining the challenges of applying it for securing smart city applications."

9470895,On Medical Device Cybersecurity Compliance in EU,"The medical device products at the European Union market must be safe and effective. To ensure this, medical device manufacturers must comply to the new regulatory requirements brought by the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR). In general, the new regulations increase regulatory requirements and oversight, especially for medical software, and this is also true for requirements related to cybersecurity, which are now explicitly addressed in the legislation. The significant legislation changes currently underway, combined with increased cybersecurity requirements, create unique challenges for manufacturers to comply with the regulatory framework. In this paper, we review the new cybersecurity requirements in the light of currently available guidance documents, and pinpoint four core concepts around which cybersecurity compliance can be built. We argue that these core concepts form a foundations for cybersecurity compliance in the European Union regulatory framework."
9116258,Cybersecurity Evaluation with PowerShell,"An organization’s cybersecurity posture is trending as one of the most highly regarded areas of focus. As more companies fall victim to breaches and exploits, we find more cases where corporations are falling victim to this and we find they attribute to improper defined security practices, failure to have a policy to address breaches or even comply with their existing strategies. It comes as no surprise that the effects of breaches and the eventual compromise of data continues to impact every level from large corporations down to the individuals. Therefore, it is imperative to provide individuals with a comparative method to retrieve a common baseline of their cybersecurity posture versus an acceptable established standard. Existing audit measures are quite cumbersome and introduce room for errors. Using PowerShell provides a method to automate parsing information into a company’s existing policy and expose any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. PowerShell audit process used here will provide an organization with the method to self-check without having to incorporate the use of software from third-party tools. Because of PowerShell’s flexibility of parsing information using from the OS environment. CSET as designed by the collaborative efforts from Department Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) provides a very thorough method of producing an evaluation of the organization’s Cybersecurity posture. Their tool achieves this through various means which may require an auditor participant to produce the necessary information by manually extracting values, such as whether software firewall rules are enabled or not. The research done here will focus on executing query commands and automating much of the manual process of gathering data to eliminate the human component. We achieve this by combining PowerShell functions which can give the auditor another method to tailor their audit experience to what is relevant in...

8993105,SecML: A Proposed Modeling Language for CyberSecurity,"Cybersecurity is a comparatively new discipline, related to computer science, electrical engineering, and similar subjects. As a newer discipline it lacks some of the tools found in more established subject areas. As one example, many engineering disciplines have modeling languages specific for that engineering discipline. As two examples, software engineering utilizes Unified Modeling Language (UML) and systems engineering uses System Modeling Language (SysML). Cybersecurity engineering lacks such a generalized modeling language. Cybersecurity as a profession would be enhanced with a security specific modeling language. This paper describes such a modeling language. The model is described in sufficient detail to be actionable and applicable. However, suggestions for future work are also provided."

Regulation is not keeping pace with technological developments. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a regulatory framework that will be several steps ahead. Specialist certification and licensing of cybersecurity products is one of the most important methods of regulating new technologies. The article attempts to systematize the experience of various countries in the field of licensing and certification in the field of cybersecurity. This article discusses cybersecurity professional certification, cybersecurity software licensing, and lists reasons why certification and licensing are a necessity of today's world."
9675075,Cybersecurity Taxonomy: research and knowledge areas,"In this paper, we proposed a taxonomy to relate areas of knowledge with cybersecurity research. The structure of the taxonomy integrates various areas of knowledge applied in research, congresses, certifications, tools and work roles defined in the ACM curriculum. Through the proposed taxonomy, students in science and engineering can find lines of research and knowledge generated in the field of cybersecurity. In this way, the generation of academic projects and research related to cybersecurity is promoted. The proposal aims to reduce the gap in the search for bibliographic sources by allowing the addition in academic curricula in engineering and science careers. This contributes to the development of new work roles and research methodologies generating knowledge through the cases of cyber-attack suffered by organizations. The basis of the proposed taxonomy is based on the integration of the ACM curriculum with the NICE framework and the topics most relevant to the understanding of cybersecurity. The proposal was validated based on the judgment of experts in higher education resulting in a 54% improvement in the level of knowledge in cybersecurity lines generated by the proposed taxonomy."
9113458,Antecedents of Cybersecurity Implementation: A Study of the Cyber-Preparedness of U.K. Social Enterprises,"The cybersecurity of organizations is a subject of perennial concern as they are subject to mounting threats in an increasingly digitalized world. While commercial and charitable organizations have been the objects of cybersecurity research, social enterprises (SEs) have remained unexplored. As SEs have become increasingly important features of social and economic development, so their prominence as potential targets of cybercrime also increases. In order to address this knowledge gap, this article examines the factors that influence the cyber-preparedness of SEs in the U.K. Through the use of semistructured interviews with SE owner-managers, these factors are found to comprise the characteristics of the enterprise, the characteristics of the enterprise management, resource constraints, experience of cyberattacks, usage of IT, and awareness of cybersecurity schemes and resources. These insights provide valuable guidance for SE owner-managers, SE support agencies, and policy-makers when considering the cybersecurity of SEs. These findings are of immediate concern to SEs but also to other organizations that are engaged in partnerships with them as SEs may afford “gateway” opportunities to those with malicious intent."
9716070,A Review on Cybersecurity of Cloud Computing for Supporting Connected Vehicle Applications,"In an internet-of-things (IoT) environment, cloud computing is emerging as a technologically feasible and economically viable solution for supporting real-time and non-real-time connected vehicle (CV) applications due to its unlimited storage, enormous computing capabilities, and cost advantage, i.e., cloud computing costs less than owning such systems. However, maintaining cybersecurity is a major challenge in cloud-supported CV applications as it requires CVs and various transportation or non-transportation services to exchange data with the cloud via multiple wired and wireless communication networks, such as long-term evolution (LTE) and Wi-Fi. In this paper, we review the cybersecurity requirements of cloud-supported CV applications, such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, accountability, and privacy. Our review also identifies the associated cybersecurity challenges that might impact cloud-supported CV applications and corresponding solutions to these challenges. In addition, we present future research opportunities to prevent and mitigate cybersecurity issues in cloud computing for CV-related applications."
9637296,ABET Cybersecurity Continual Course Improvements for Secure Software Development,"This is an innovative practice full paper. The need to develop software securely cannot be over-emphasized. The changing legal and regulatory international and local landscape for software requirements is astounding. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the United States' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Chinese Cybersecurity laws, and the credit card industry's Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) are all upholding higher standards for system development and deployment. Such legal and regulatory changes of necessity require modifications and updating in software development methods that must be incorporated into cybersecurity software development courses to properly prepare students for successfully working in the field. To address these and other changes within the computing field, the Accreditation Board for Engineering (ABET) recently proposed preliminary cybersecurity accreditation criteria for which fewer than 20 universities have both applied and become ABET Cybersecurity accredited. The accreditation requires maintaining continuous course improvement in the core courses including a secure software development course. This research first reports on important topics incorporated into a senior-level secure software development for cybersecurity majors. Our research then analyses student Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved surveys to learn which course components could benefit from continuous course improvements. We apply machine learning to help build categories for ABET continual improvement. Finally, we share lessons learned and plans for future work."

However, in this paper we show that current maritime cybersecurity guidelines have two main shortcomings in that they neither provide a set of holistic recommendations to the key stakeholders in the maritime transportation system nor are the current guidelines sufficiently grounded in research. Thus, as a second contribution in this paper, we propose a comprehensive outline aimed to allow the stakeholders to develop comprehensive and thus more effective cybersecurity guidelines for the maritime transportation system."
9281757,Cybersecurity Analysis of Distribution Grid Operation with Distributed Energy Resources via Co-Simulation,"As penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) continue to increase in power grids, many utilities have analyzed their impacts on grid operations. However, cybersecurity impacts of these DERs connecting to the grid have only begun to follow. Especially, analyzing how potential cybersecurity attacks manifest on the grid such as voltage stability and power flows requires modeling both communication network and power grid components, and co-simulating them. In pursuit of this effort, a cyber-physical co-simulation code base is developed to investigate the impact of cybersecurity attacks on distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS), using a communication network simulator (ns-3), a virtual machine emulator (QEMU), an IEEE 1815 communication protocol implementation (Opendnp3), a distribution grid simulator (GridLAB-D) and a hierarchical engine for large-scale infrastructure co-simulation (HELICS). A total of four cybersecurity attack scenarios on a DERMS that manages 20 solar photovoltaic generation inverters are simulated using two feeders of the City of Riverside Public Utilities in California, USA. The impact of the attacks on these feeders is analyzed."
9006444,Extracting Rich Semantic Information about Cybersecurity Events,"Articles about cybersecurity events like data breaches and ransomware attacks are common, both in general news and technical sources. Automatically extracting structured information from these can provide valuable information to inform both human analysts and computer systems. In this paper we describe how cybersecurity events can be described via semantic schemas, examined through an initial set of five event types. Using a collection of 1,000 news articles annotated with these event types, including their semantic roles, arguments, realis, and coreference, we detail a modular, deep-learning based information extraction (IE) pipeline, which extracts useful event information with high accuracy. We argue that the event argument set considered here can support many other cybersecurity events, facilitating the extension to new cybersecurity event types, such as distributed denial of service and SQL injection attacks."

9073093,RelExt: Relation Extraction using Deep Learning approaches for Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph Improvement,"Security Analysts that work in a `Security Operations Center' (SoC) play a major role in ensuring the security of the organization. The amount of background knowledge they have about the evolving and new attacks makes a significant difference in their ability to detect attacks. Open source threat intelligence sources, like text descriptions about cyber-attacks, can be stored in a structured fashion in a cybersecurity knowledge graph. A cybersecurity knowledge graph can be paramount in aiding a security analyst to detect cyber threats because it stores a vast range of cyber threat information in the form of semantic triples which can be queried. A semantic triple contains two cybersecurity entities with a relationship between them. In this work, we propose a system to create semantic triples over cybersecurity text, using deep learning approaches to extract possible relationships. We use the set of semantic triples generated through our system to assert in a c ybersecurity knowledge graph. Security Analysts can retrieve this data from the knowledge graph, and use this information to form a decision about a cyber-attack."
9381324,A Census of Swedish Government Administrative Authority Employee Communications on Cybersecurity during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Cybersecurity is the backbone of a successful digitalization of society, and cyber situation awareness is an essential aspect of managing it. The COVID-19 pandemic has sped up an already ongoing digitalization of Swedish government agencies, but the cybersecurity maturity level varies across agencies. In this study, we conduct a census of Swedish government administrative authority communications on cybersecurity to employees at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The census shows that the employee communications in the beginning of the pandemic to a greater extent have focused on first-order risks, such as video meetings and telecommuting, rather than on second-order risks, such as invoice fraud or social engineering. We also find that almost two thirds of the administrative authorities have not yet implemented, but only initiated or documented, their cybersecurity policies."
9081786,Evaluation of the LDACS Cybersecurity Implementation,"Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) infrastructure in civil aviation must evolve as fast as possible to cope with all challenges posed by the growth of the worldwide population, globalization and the worldwide demand for more and more mobility. Analogue systems are replaced by digital means and automation is becoming much more important to be able to handle the large amount of new entrants in the air traffic system. Spectrum saturation must be solved by introducing digital systems and safety and security of the safety critical infrastructure surrounding civil aviation must be constantly updated to support the ever-growing system complexity. As one of the Future Communication Infrastructure (FCI) candidates we introduce LDACS as the very first true integrated CNS system worldwide. In previous works we have already analyzed its cybersecurity, developed a cybersecurity architecture with corresponding algorithms and demonstrated the improvement in cybersecurity due to our security additions. Here we implement the LDACS cybersecurity architecture and evaluate the impact of introduced security overhead on the LDACS system. We conclude that the proposed protection mechanisms successfully mitigate previously identified risks and only add minor time, data and computation overhead on top of the LDACS protocol stack. With this result, the security solutions are a good candidate to be included in the SESAR wave 2 updated LDACS specification."

Meanwhile, governments, businesses, and individual Internet users show the growing public appetite to improve cyber resilience that refers to their ability to prepare for, combat and recover from cyber threats and incidents. Undoubtedly, predicting cybersecurity incidents is deemed to have excellent potential for proactively advancing cyber resilience. Research communities and industries have begun proposing cybersecurity incident prediction schemes by utilizing different types of data sources, including organization’s reports and datasets, network data, synthetic data, data crawled from webpages, and data retrieved from social media. With a focus on the dataset, this survey paper investigates the emerging research by reviewing recent representative works appeared in the dominant period. We also extract and summarize the data-driven research methodology commonly adopted in this fast-growing area. In consonance with the phases of the methodology, each work that predicts cybersecurity incident is comprehensively studied. Challenges and future directions in this field are also discussed."
9283100,Cybersecurity Framework for P300-based Brain Computer Interface,"This paper describes a cybersecurity framework for protecting brain computer interface (BCI) technology. This framework consists of cybersecurity risk scenarios related to user safety/privacy and best practices to manage them. This framework provides solutions for privacy and safety issues of the existing noninvasive BCIs (e.g., electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI). We chose to design a P300-based BCI application because it is the most popular modality, simulate some common cybersecurity attacks, and find a relevant solution to protect the user and/or integrated EEG hardware-software system. In this paper, we describe how cybersecurity risks could affect BCI form streaming/recording EEG signal in real-time until sending commands. We used EEG Equipment for measuring brain activity and Python programing language to build our experimental paradigm, record EEG signal, classify P300 components, send a message to another user, simulate some attacks, and find perfect solutions for assuring high BCI protection. This paper gives an overview of the framework, some description of BCI hacking challenges and their impact on BCI users as well as a preliminary demonstration of a P300-based BCI system with two common simple attacks."

Many theories from behavioural science like the theory of planned behaviour and protection motivation theory have been used to investigate the factors that affect the cybersecurity behaviour and practices of the end-user. In this paper, the researchers have used Fogg behaviour model (FBM) to study factors affecting the cybersecurity behaviour and practices of smartphone users. This study found that the odds of secure behaviour and practices by respondents with high motivation and high ability were 4.64 times more than the respondents with low motivation and low ability. This study describes how FBM may be used in the design and development of cybersecurity awareness program leading to a behaviour change."
8875389,Incentive Contract for Cybersecurity Information Sharing Considering Monitoring Signals,"Cyber insurance is a viable method for cyber risk transfer. However, the cyber insurance faces critical challenges, the most important of which is lack of statistical data. In this paper, we proposed an incentive model considering monitoring signals for cybersecurity information haring based on the principal-agent theory. We studied the effect of monitoring signals on increasing the rationality of the incentive contract and reducing moral hazard in the process of cybersecurity information sharing, and analyzed factors influencing the effectiveness of the incentive contract. We show that by introducing monitoring signals, the insurer can collect more information about the effort level of the insured, and encourage the insured to share cybersecurity information based on the information sharing output and monitoring signals of the effort level, which can not only reduce the blindness of incentive to the insured in the process of cybersecurity information sharing, but also reduce moral hazard."
9269524,Using Event-Based Method to Estimate Cybersecurity Equilibrium,"Estimating the global state of a networked system is an important problem in many application domains. The classical approach to tackling this problem is the periodic (observation) method, which is inefficient because it often observes states at a very high frequency. This inefficiency has motivated the idea of event-based method, which leverages the evolution dynamics in question and makes observations only when some rules are triggered (i.e., only when certain conditions hold). This paper initiates the investigation of using the event-based method to estimate the equilibrium in the new application domain of cybersecurity, where equilibrium is an important metric that has no closed-form solutions. More specifically, the paper presents an event-based method for estimating cybersecurity equilibrium in the preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics, which has been proven globally convergent. The presented study proves that the estimated equilibrium from our trigger rule i) indeed converges to the equilibrium of the dynamics and ii) is Zeno-free, which assures the usefulness of the event-based method. Numerical examples show that the event-based method can reduce 98% of the observation cost incurred by the periodic method. In order to use the event-based method in practice, this paper investigates how to bridge the gap between i) the continuous state in the dynamics model, which is dubbed probability-state because it measures the probability that a node is in the secure or compromised state, and ii) the discrete state that is often encountered in practice, dubbed sample-state because it is sampled from some nodes. This bridge may be of independent value because probability-state models have been widely used to approximate exponentially-many discrete state systems."
9583691,Success Factors for Designing a Cybersecurity Exercise on the Example of Incident Response,"Exercises are a resource intensive form of providing participants learning, capability testing and validation of plans and procedures. As exercises commonly are used in the field of cybersecurity, their effective and optimal organisation is important. This article aims at identifying key exercise organisation assessment indicators, regardless of exercise type or goal, on the example of cyber incident response exercises. Based on practical experience and literature on crisis management, incident response, and cybersecurity exercises, a 10-step exercise organisation process is identified. For each step, criticalities for the designers and other stakeholders of cyber incident response exercises are identified. These criticalities are also translated in a checklist of actionable indicators aimed at supporting them in measuring the quality of the exercise and implementing an exercise organisation learning loop."

9714728,On the Cybersecurity of Traffic Signal Control System With Connected Vehicles,"Connected vehicle (CV) technology brings both opportunities and challenges to the traffic signal control (TSC) system. While safety and mobility performance could be greatly improved by adopting CV technologies, the connectivity between vehicles and transportation infrastructure may increase the risks of cyber threats. In the past few years, studies related to cybersecurity on the TSC systems were conducted. However, there still lacks a systematic investigation that provides a comprehensive analysis framework. In this study, our aim is to fill the research gap by proposing a comprehensive analysis framework for the cybersecurity problem of the TSC in the CV environment. With potential threats towards the major components of the system and their corresponding impacts on safety and efficiency analyzed, data spoofing attack is considered the most plausible and realistic attack approach. Based on this finding, different attack strategies and defense solutions are discussed. A case study is presented to show the impact of the data spoofing attacks towards a selected CV based TSC system and corresponding mitigation countermeasures. This case study is conducted on a hybrid security testing platform, with virtual traffic and a real V2X communication network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present a comprehensive analysis framework to the cybersecurity problem of the CV-based TSC systems."
9457098,Cybersecurity Challenges for Manufacturing Systems 4.0: Assessment of the Business Impact Level,"An ever-growing number of companies are moving toward the Industry 4.0 paradigm, adopting a range of advanced technologies (e.g., smart sensors, big data analytics, and cloud computing) and networking their manufacturing systems. This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of operations but also introduces new cybersecurity challenges. In this article, the impact assessment methodology is applied in the context of manufacturing systems 4.0 (also known as smart manufacturing systems, cyber manufacturing systems, or digital manufacturing systems), thus identifying the critical assets to be protected against cyber-attacks and assessing the business impacts in the case of subtractive and additive technologies. The research design of the single case study with multiple units of analysis is applied. In particular, a large company, a leader in the manufacturing of aeronautical components, is considered a representative case study, and its two main types of manufacturing cells that is, those based on networked computer numerical control machines and 3-D printers, are taken as applicative cases for the methodology. The application of the impact assessment methodology in the manufacturing context 4.0 of aeronautical components represents a useful guide for researchers in the field of cybersecurity and for companies intending to implement it in their smart manufacturing environments. In particular, based on this study, companies can define the critical manufacturing data to protect against cyber-attacks, isolate the business impacts in case of cybersecurity breaches, correlate the identified business impacts with the specific data category, and assess the level of business impacts."
9619798,The Evolution of Cyber Security Norm Development in The Digital Age,"The development of normative cybersecurity behaviors in cyberspace plays a critical role in the resilience of the global digital supply chain. This case study takes a longitudinal approach in analyzing cyber norm development activities throughout 1997–2020. A total of 216 individual cases were collected, and 233 individual cyber norms were identified and compiled into 25 subject categories, allowing for a longitudinal view of cyber norm activities, and the changes of cyber norm developments over these years. This examination enables us to identify which cyber norms (if any) would work: norms with consistent activity across the timeline were considered successful, while those norms that disappeared completely or for long periods were considered unsuccessful. Considering such trends of success in cyber norm development allows for the prospect of a successful cybersecurity environment in the future. and guides the construction of cybersecurity governance in the digital age."

9427684,Digital Labels: Influencing Consumers Trust and Raising Cybersecurity Awareness for Adopting Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer a wide range of promising benefits by reducing traffic accidents, environmental pollution, traffic congestion and land usage etc. However, to reap the intended benefits of AVs, it is inevitable that this technology should be trusted and accepted by the public. The consumer's substantial trust upon AVs will lead to its widespread adoption in the real-life. It is well understood that the preservation of strong security and privacy features influence a consumer's trust on a product in a positive manner. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of digital labels for AVs to increase consumers awareness and trust regarding the security level of their vehicle. We present an architecture called Cybersecurity Box (CSBox) that leverages digital labels to display and inform consumers and passengers about cybersecurity status of the AV in use. The introduction of cybersecurity digital labels on the dashboard of AVs would attempt to increase the trust level of consumers and passengers on this promising technology."

This paper discusses the profiling of attackers, which, in practice, can help in managing cybersecurity events. The main goal of the research is to perform attackers' profiling as close as possible to real-time processing. The paper outlines the basic idea of real-time attacker profiling. We use stream processing. Within the system, we profile attackers into seven profiles or mark them as outliers if they do not fall into any of the known profiles. The paper also deals with the dynamic profiling model update and the difference of the calculated model using the original non-real-time model."
9594376,Cybersecurity for Flight Deck Data Exchange,"Recent flight deck advancements include rapidly expanding applications for Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs), high-bandwidth air-ground data links using Internet Protocols (IP), and the introduction of Aircraft Interface Devices (AIDs) that connect legacy avionics busses, EFBs, and the IP communication links. These advances allow the flight deck to participate in system-wide information sharing and enable pilots to more fully and collaboratively participate in air traffic management decision making. However, the introduction of these connected aircraft systems potentially expose the applications and networks on board the aircraft to a variety of new cybersecurity threats. This paper reviews a generic networked aircraft architecture that uses the EFB, AID & IP Data Links to implement two sample applications and performs a qualitative cybersecurity analysis on the resulting system. The cybersecurity analysis assumes typical aviation security measures are in place and is used to identify any residual risks and makes recommendations for additional security measures where required."

9105520,When Software Engineering meets Cybersecurity at the classroom,"Software Engineering is a foundation on modern computer systems development. This discipline is offered by the large branch of related university degrees these days around the world, among with other computer science courses. As we all know, cybersecurity problems are mostly related with software, for example bad implementations, poor quality achieved, lack of testing. Overall the bigger problem is lack of security planification since the inception and designing of the project. Cybersecurity had gained a lot of attention in recent years. From everyday desktop software been exploited, such as browser exploits and Windows RDP protocol exploits, to abusing Internet of Things to create massive botnets capable to disrupt the Internet service, the case of Mirai in 2017 as an example. We believe that if security played a basic role from the inception of the software project, much of this incidents could be prevented. So, we are proposing to introduce cybersecurity basics in the software engineering courses to raise the awareness of this problems to future professional software engineers."
9123059,Temporal Understanding of Cybersecurity Threats,"As cybersecurity-related threats continue to increase, understanding how the field is changing over time can give insight into combating new threats and understanding historical events. We show how to apply dynamic topic models to a set of cybersecurity documents to understand how the concepts found in them are changing over time. We correlate two different data sets, the first relates to specific exploits and the second relates to cybersecurity research. We use Wikipedia concepts to provide a basis for performing concept phrase extraction and show how using concepts to provide context improves the quality of the topic model. We represent the results of the dynamic topic model as a knowledge graph that could be used for inference or information discovery."
8975603,Demographic Factors of Cybersecurity Awareness in Bangladesh,"The growing rate of cybercrime has turned into a crucial concern that makes people more afraid of cyberwar than a nuclear weapon and climate change. An alarming awareness level has been observed in this study which is not satisfactory. A significant percentage of the population is unaware of cybersecurity policies and practices. Even the relevant organizations, as well as the government, are not concerned about the issues of cybercrime. A significant variation is essential to enrich the cybersecurity policies and practices. Furthermore, it needs to be monitored and restructured with the pace of time. This pilot study is designed to consider a comprehensive investigation regarding the level of cybercrime awareness amongst Bangladeshi people. The survey has been carried out through both the online and offline responses against a well-prepared questionnaire. Additionally, T-test, mean score and ANOVA tests were accompanied for detailed analysis. Based on this study, it is recommended that the development and implementation of a massive cybersecurity awareness program are urgently required that would immune the citizens from cyber threats."

The approach taken is to articulate explicit questions about the origins of cybersecurity knowledge based on the author’s reflections on common ground and differences between cybersecurity knowledge creation practices and selected epistemological sources. Although no independent evidence is presented for the validity or utility of these questions, the author hopes to refine these questions and the underlying assumptions on which they are based both through feedback on this paper and future empirical studies."
9061242,Cybersecurity in the Blockchain Era : A Survey on Examining Critical Infrastructure Protection with Blockchain-Based Technology,"Cybercriminals and nation-state hackers are investing heavily in strategies devised to disrupt critical infrastructure systems. Nearly one out of two Industrial Control System (ICS) computers in the energy sector had been impacted by malicious cyber activity in 2018. With threats increasing and attack vectors expanding, critical infrastructure sectors like energy need to implement innovative technology to ensure Critical Infrastructure Protection. This study reviewed blockchain research published between 2015 and 2019 in order to examine the development of blockchain, evaluate current applications of blockchain in the energy sector, and propose additional opportunities for the application of blockchain technology. Quantitative analysis revealed that blockchain-based cybersecurity research and application in the energy sector is increasing at an annual average growth rate of 169% since 2015 with intensified focus on Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Grid infrastructures. Computed projections forecast a continued increase in the research and application of IoT and Smart Grids. Calculations indicate that nearly 50% of the new research will be in blockchain-based cybersecurity solutions such as cryptographic communications and secure email. Qualitative analysis indicates potential for blockchain- based cybersecurity solutions to provide enhanced Critical Infrastructure Protection in those sectors against pervasive phishing and social engineering threats."

9026901,Additive Manufacturing Cyber-Physical System: Supply Chain Cybersecurity and Risks,"Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods have become increasingly efficient and industrially viable in the past ten years. These methods offer the freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain (digital thread) with the physical supply chain and their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further, we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged."
9555622,Adversarial XAI Methods in Cybersecurity,"Machine Learning methods are playing a vital role in combating ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity domain. Explanation methods that shed light on the decision process of black-box classifiers are one of the biggest drivers in the successful adoption of these models. Explaining predictions that address ‘Why?/Why Not?’ questions help users/stakeholders/analysts understand and accept the predicted outputs with confidence and build trust. Counterfactual explanations are gaining popularity as an alternative method to help users to not only understand the decisions of black-box models (why?) but also to provide a mechanism to highlight mutually exclusive data instances that would change the outcomes (why not?). Recent Explainable Artificial Intelligence literature has focused on three main areas: (a) creating and improving explainability methods that help users better understand how the internal of ML models work as well as their outputs; (b) attacks on interpreters with a white-box setting; (c) defining the relevant properties, metrics of explanations generated by models. Nevertheless, there is no thorough study of how the model explanations can introduce new attack surfaces to the underlying systems. A motivated adversary can leverage the information provided by explanations to launch membership inference, and model extraction attacks to compromise the overall privacy of the system. Similarly, explanations can also facilitate powerful evasion attacks such as poisoning and back door attacks. In this paper, we cover this gap by tackling various cybersecurity properties and threat models related to counterfactual explanations. We propose a new black-box attack that leverages Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to compromise the confidentiality and privacy properties of underlying classifiers. We validate our approach with datasets and models used in the cyber security domain to demonstrate that our method achieves the attacker’s goal under threat mod...

9644479,Exploring the Impact of Information Security Climate and Information Security Training on Cybersecurity Behavior: Based on Protection Motivation Theory,"It has been widely agreed that employees' cybersecurity behavior is a key factor to prevent information security events. According to Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), this study developed a theoretical model to better understand how organization environments encourage employees' cybersecurity behavior. With a survey data of 513 Chinese civil servants, this study empirically found that both information security climate and information security training are positively associated with employees' perceived severity, perceived vulnerability and response efficacy. Furthermore, all the three factors are significantly related to employees' cybersecurity behavior."
9524529,Quantifying Cybersecurity Effectiveness of Dynamic Network Diversity,"The deployment of monoculture software stacks has devastating consequences because a single attack can compromise all of the vulnerable computers in cyberspace. This one-vulnerability-affects-all phenomenon will continue until after software stacks are diversified, which is well recognized by the research community. However, existing studies mainly focused on investigating the effectiveness of software diversity at the building-block level (e.g., whether two independent implementations indeed exhibit independent vulnerabilities); the effectiveness of enforcing network-wide software diversity is little understood, despite its importance in possibly helping justify investment in software diversification. As a first step towards ultimately tackling this problem, we propose a systematic framework for modeling and quantifying the cybersecurity effectiveness of network diversity, including a suite of cybersecurity metrics. We also present an agent-based simulation to empirically demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. We draw a number of insights, including the surprising result that proactive diversity is effective under very special circumstances, but reactive-adaptive diversity is much more effective in most cases."

In the case of cybersecurity, it helps to better analyze previous cyber attacks and develop proactive strategy to detect, prevent the security threats. Both ML and cybersecurity are important subjects in computing curriculum but ML for security is not well presented there. We design and develop case-study based portable labware on Google CoLab for ML to cybersecurity so that students can access, share, collaborate, and practice these hands-on labs anywhere and anytime without time tedious installation and configuration which will help students more focus on learning of concepts and getting more experience for hands-on problem solving skills."
9735409,Quantum-Key-Distribution Based Microgrid Control for Cybersecurity Enhancement,"The integration of information and communication technologies has introduced cybersecurity challenges to microgrid (MG) apart from bringing more flexibility, reliability, and resilience. Especially in the upcoming quantum era, the existing cryptographic systems are vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers. Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a quantum-key-distribution (QKD) based MG distributed control framework for cybersecurity enhancement. To defend the side-channel attacks and make the framework practical enough for industrial applications, measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) is introduced. The following contributions are made in this work: 1) A novel QKD based quantum-secure control architecture is established to assure the data transmission security in MG distributed control. 2) MDI-QKD with asymmetric protocol is used to form a scalable QKD network for MG control. 3) A method for fast parameter optimization based on deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to adjust the parameters in QKD systems in real-time. Simulations are carried on a 13-bus MG to demonstrate the working principles of the proposed control scheme. The test results also prove the feasibility of the DNN based parameter optimizer."

9162381,An Empirical Analysis of Blockchain Cybersecurity Incidents,"The establishment of Bitcoin in 2008 has introduced Blockchain technology to become the predominant new ways in digital transactions in many fields, such as energy, healthcare, and financial services. Although blockchain technology promised many advantages, it has suffered from various attacks with significant financial loses. We analyse 65 cybersecurity incidents that have been happening on the blockchain networks between 2011 and the first half-year of 2019. We categorize those incidents against the key cybersecurity vulnerabilities in blockchain technology, which showed an upward trend of an increasing number of attacks which dues to lack of security controls in the digital currency exchange and vulnerability in smart contracts. This result of this research highlights the needs in a major overhaul of the blockchain technology."
9619624,Cybersecurity architecture functional model for cyber risk reduction in IoT based wearable devices,"In this paper, we propose a functional model for the implementation of devices that use the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, the number of devices connected to the internet per person has increased from 0.08 in 2003 to a total of 6.58 in 2020, suggesting an increase of 8,225% in 7 years. The proposal includes a functional IoT model of a cybersecurity architecture by including components to ensure compliance with the proposed controls within a cybersecurity framework to detect cyber threats in IoT-based wearable devices. The proposal focuses on reducing the number of vulnerabilities present in IoT devices since, on average, 57% of these devices are vulnerable to attacks. The model has a 3-layer structure: business, applications, and technology, where components such as policies, services and nodes are described accordingly. The validation was done through a simulated environment of a system for the control and monitoring of pregnant women using wearable devices. The results show reductions of the probability index and the impact of risks by 14.95% and 6.81% respectively."
9255753,Expanding Cybersecurity Knowledge Through an Indigenous Lens: A First Look,"Decolonization and Indigenous education are at the forefront of Canadian content currently in Academia. Over the last few decades, we have seen some major changes in the way in which we share information. In particular, we have moved into an age of electronically-shared content, and there is an increasing expectation in Canada that this content is both culturally significant and relevant. In this paper, we discuss an ongoing community engagement initiative with First Nations communities in the Western Manitoba region. The initiative involves knowledge-sharing activities that focus on the topic of cybersecurity, and are aimed at a public audience. This initial look into our educational project focuses on the conceptual analysis and planning stage. We are developing a “Cybersecurity 101” mini-curriculum, to be implemented over several one-hour long workshops aimed at diverse groups (these public workshops may include a wide range of participants, from tech-adverse to tech-savvy). Learning assessment tools have been built in to the workshop program. We have created informational and promotional pamphlets, posters, lesson plans, and feedback questionnaires which we believe instill relevance and personal connection to this topic, helping to bridge gaps in accessibility for Indigenous communities while striving to build positive, reciprocal relationships. Our methodology is to approach the subject from a community needs and priorities perspective. Activities are therefore being tailored to fit each community. We hope this will lead to increased awareness and engagement by community members. Two Indigenous student research assistants were hired to assist in this project, which has developed into a blend of community outreach on the topic of security and data protection (most notably with respect to social media and online banking) and a computing education student-led educational research project."
9454150,Teaching Efficient Computer Science and Cybersecurity Courses Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic,"It is an understatement to say that teaching efficient Computer Science and Cybersecurity courses amidst the COVID19 pandemic has placed extreme pressure on faculty. In general, this is true for any academic area which has a strong hands-on component tied to the theoretical counterpart. In this paper, we chronicle and provide our approach, from the lens of St. John's University Computer Science Chairperson and the Cybersecurity Program Director, on the suitability of utilizing WebEx HandsOn-Labs tool to close the instructional gap that exists between face-to-face and fully online teaching."
9595142,Green IoT System Architecture for Applied Autonomous Network Cybersecurity Monitoring,"Network security morning (NSM) is essential for any cybersecurity system, where the average cost of a cyberattack is
$1.1
million. No matter how much a system is secure, it will eventually fail without proper and continuous monitoring. No wonder that the cybersecurity market is expected to grow up to
$170.4
billion in 2022. However, the majority of legacy industries do not invest in NSM implementation until it is too late due to the initial and operation cost and static unutilized resources. Thus, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Internet of things (IoT) architecture for an industrial NSM that features a low installation and operation cost, low power consumption, intelligent organization behavior, and environmentally friendly operation. As a case study, the system is implemented in a midrange oil a gas manufacture facility in the southern states with more than 300 machines and servers over three remote locations and a production plant that features a challenging atmosphere condition. The proposed system successfully shows a significant saving
(>65
%) in power consumption, acquires one-tenth the installation cost, develops an intelligent operation expert system tools as well as saves the environment from more than 500 mg of CO2 pollution per hour, promoting green IoT systems."
9319024,Assessing the provision of public-facing cybersecurity guidance for end-users,"The increased use of digital technologies and services brings with it a similarly increasing requirement for their end-users to have the awareness and ability to protect the security and privacy of their devices and data. However, this raises the related questions of what they need to know and from where they may obtain related guidance. The discussion begins by considering the knowledge and skills that could usefully characterize a cybersecurity literate user. The paper then proceeds to examine the provision of end-user guidance from 17 public-facing sources, spanning national sources, operating system provides, training providers and popular online services. The findings illustrate that, while some topics are commonly covered, none of them are found to be uniformly addressed across all sources. As such, the level of awareness that users may have, and the level of good practice that they may follow, is likely to be highly dependent upon where they have looked for guidance. This points toward the need for a consistent and more harmonized approach if we wish to ensure that a common baseline of cybersecurity literacy can be achieved across an increasingly digital society."
9125011,Business Models of Collaborative Networked Organisations: Implications for Cybersecurity Collaboration,"The incorporation of advanced information and communications technologies allows for the effective collaboration of diverse and geographically distributed legal entities in networked organisations, implementing various business models. This paper presents the results of a survey of academic sources on business models of collaborative networks and their implications for the design of models of collaboration in the field of cybersecurity. It outlines the transition from traditional to digital business models, provides examples of business models in ad-hoc, long-term and goal-oriented organisational collaborations, and presents identified best practices, forms of collaboration, main processes, and key roles in a network. The paper presents a taxonomy of business models, used to span the exploration space in a follow-on design of governance and management models of a cybersecurity competence network."
9476383,Cybersecurity risks : A behavioural approach through the influence of media and information literacy,"The growing use of digital media has been accompanied by an increase of the risks associated with the use of information systems, notably cybersecurity risks. In turn, the increasing use of information systems has an impact on users' media and information literacy. This research aims to address the relationship between media and information literacy, and the adoption of risky cybersecurity behaviours. This approach will be carried out through the definition of a conceptual framework supported by a literature review, and a quantitative research of the relationships mentioned earlier considering a sample composed by students of a Higher Education Institution."
9448913,A Process to Facilitate Automated Automotive Cybersecurity Testing,"Modern vehicles become increasingly digitalized with advanced information technology-based solutions like advanced driving assistance systems and vehicle-to-x communications. These systems are complex and interconnected. Rising complexity and increasing outside exposure has created a steadily rising demand for more cyber-secure systems. Thus, also standardization bodies and regulators issued standards and regulations to prescribe more secure development processes. This security, however, also has to be validated and verified. In order to keep pace with the need for more thorough, quicker and comparable testing, today's generally manual testing processes have to be structured and optimized. Based on existing and emerging standards for cybersecurity engineering, this paper therefore outlines a structured testing process for verifying and validating automotive cybersecurity, for which there is no standardized method so far. Despite presenting a commonly structured framework, the process is flexible in order to allow implementers to utilize their own, accustomed toolsets."
9334097,Employees' Cybersecurity Behaviour in the Mobile Context: The Role of Self-Efficacy and Psychological Ownership,"Mobile devices are widely known to be a cybersecurity risk for organisations. However, their use for work purposes is largely becoming a common practice as most organisations rather prefer to find security countermeasures than miss out on the momentous benefits they provide. Since the weakest link in cybersecurity is the human element, organisations are increasingly looking for ways to upskill their employees so that they can be able to implement the necessary security safeguards. Yet, a concerning trend is that even individuals with a high-security self-efficacy sometimes fail to take the needed security actions. To better understand why this occurs, the present study proposes and validates psychological ownership as a possible boundary condition for explaining the security self-efficacy to security behaviour nexus in the mobile security context. Using an online survey with 214 respondents, this study showed that both the direct and indirect effects of security self-efficacy on mobile device security behaviour were moderated by psychological ownership such that the effects were more pronounced when psychological ownership was high than when it was low. The paper culminates with a discussion of the implications for theory and practice."
9087634,Optimization of Cybersecurity Investment Strategies in the Smart Grid Using Game-Theory,"With the increasing penetration of cyber systems in the power grid, it is becoming increasingly imperative to deploy adequate security measures all across the grid to secure it against any kind of cyber threat. Since financial resources for investment in security are limited, optimal allocation of these cybersecurity resources in the grid is extremely important. At the same time, optimization of these investments proves to be challenging due to the uncertain behavior of attackers and the dynamically changing threat landscape. Existing solutions for this problem either do not address the dynamic behavior of adversaries or lack in the practical feasibility of the defense models. This paper addresses the problem of optimizing investment strategies in the cybersecurity infrastructure of a smart grid using a game-theoretic approach. The attacker is modeled using various attacker profiles which represent the possible types of adversaries in the context of CPS. Each profile has certain characteristics to bring out the aspect of uncertain behavior of the adversaries. The defender is modeled with various pragmatic characteristics that can be easily translated to the real-world grid scenarios for implementation. These characteristics include the standards laid down by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) commonly known as the NERC-CIP standards. The game-theoretic framework allows us to obtain optimal strategies that the defender of the grid can adopt to minimize its losses against the possible attack threats on the grid. The concept is illustrated by a simplistic 3-bus power system model case study which depicts how the solution can be translated to practical implementation in the actual grid."
9020560,Performance Evaluation of Different Feature Encoding Schemes on Cybersecurity Logs,"Many cybersecurity logs contain a substantial volume of textual data regarding security events. This data needs to be converted to numerical types before any machine learning (ML) algorithms can be applied. Feature encoding is the process of transforming textual data into numerical values so they may be applied to ML algorithms, resulting in improved model accuracy. Researchers have used many approaches to convert textual data into numerical values such as, “Label Encoding” “One Hot Encoding” and “Binary Encoding”. These approaches are useful encoding schemes for dealing with large scale text data. We examine the application of these methods to cybersecurity datasets to determine which encoding scheme performs the best when used with a classification ML algorithm in identifying intrusion detections. Experimental results show that label encoding performed the best, whereas one hot encoding was least effective."
8858454,Industrial CyberSecurity 4.0: Preparing the Operational Technicians for Industry 4.0,"In the context of Industry 4.0, industrial facilities are connected to corporate data networks and are frequently administered remotely over the Internet. However, these new technologies have brought new threats into the world of industrial automation, since the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in place today were designed to operate for decades, and many of them were developed without any serious regard to IT security. Hence, the modern labor market in the industry needs trained technicians and engineers capable to identify potential cybersecurity threats and able to respond adequately when an attack is identified. Personnel training in these skills is costly, as experienced and skilled trainers are required for an ever-changing technological environment. In this context, InCyS 4.0 (Industrial CyberSecurity 4.0) is a 2-year KA2 project co-funded by the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union, that aims to create open source educational material to address training of industrial production technicians for handling cyber-security vulnerabilities. In order InCyS4.0 to assure that the developed training material fits the needs of European Industries, it conducted a field research in every partner country. Field research had the form of an anonymous questionnaire targeting the IT personnel of local industries. Aim of the research was the investigation of the security weaknesses of the participating enterprises and the extraction of the profile of the industrial IT engineers, so the project adapts the training content to the feedback. This paper describes the rationale, aims and objectives of the project, presents the outcomes of the research and outlines the proposed course material."
9087864,A Cybersecurity Insurance Model for Power System Reliability Considering Optimal Defense Resource Allocation,"With the increasing application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), cyberattacks have become more prevalent against Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) such as the modern power grids. Various methods have been proposed to model the cybersecurity threats, but so far limited studies have been focused on the defensive strategies subject to the limited security budget. In this paper, the power supply reliability is evaluated considering the strategic allocation of defense resources. Specifically, the optimal mixed strategies are formulated by the Stackelberg Security Game (SSG) to allocate the defense resources on multiple targets subject to cyberattacks. The cyberattacks against the intrusion-tolerant Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system are mathematically modeled by Semi-Markov Process (SMP) kernel. The intrusion tolerance capability of the SCADA system provides buffered residence time before the substation failure to enhance the network robustness against cyberattacks. Case studies of the cyberattack scenarios are carried out to demonstrate the intrusion tolerance capability. Depending on the defense resource allocation scheme, the intrusion-tolerant SCADA system possesses varying degrees of self-healing capability to restore to the good state and prevent the substations from failure. If more defense resources are invested on the substations, the intrusion tolerant capability can be further enhanced for protecting the substations. Finally, the actuarial insurance principle is designed to estimate transmission companies’ individual premiums considering correlated cybersecurity risks. The proposed insurance premium principle is designed to provide incentive for investments on enhancing the intrusion tolerance capability, which is verified by the results of case studies."
9051704,Cybersecurity Named Entity Recognition Using Multi-Modal Ensemble Learning,"Cybersecurity named entity recognition is an important part of threat information extraction from large-scale unstructured text collection in many cybersecurity applications. Most existing security entity recognition studies and systems use regular matching strategy or machine learning algorithms. Due to the peculiarity and complexity of security named entity, these models ignore the characteristic of security data and the correlation of entities. Therefore, through the in-depth study of security entity characteristic, we propose a novel security named entity recognition model based on regular expressions and known-entity dictionary as well as conditional random fields (CRF) combined with four feature templates. This model is named RDF-CRF. The rule-based expressions can match security entities with good accuracy in simpler situations, the known-entity dictionary can extract common and specific security entity, and the CRF-based extractor leverages the identified entities by rule-based and dictionary-based extractors to further improve the recognition performance. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, extensive experiments are performed on a security text dataset collected from public security webs. The experimental results show that can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods."
9284690,A Blockchain Solution for Enhancing Cybersecurity Defence of IoT,"The growth of IoT devices during the last decade has led to the development of smart ecosystems, such as smart homes, prone to cyberattacks. Traditional security methodologies support to some extend the requirement for preserving privacy and security of such deployments, but their centralized nature in conjunction with low computational capabilities of smart home gateways make such approaches not efficient. Last achievements on blockchain technologies allowed the use of such decentralized architectures to support cybersecurity defence mechanisms. In this work, a blockchain framework is presented to support the cybersecurity mechanisms of smart homes installations, focusing on the immutability of users and devices that constitute such environments. The proposed methodology provides also the appropriate smart contracts support for ensuring the integrity of the smart home gateway and IoT devices, as well as the dynamic and immutable management of blocked malicious IPs. The framework has been deployed on a real smart home environment demonstrating its applicability and efficiency."

However, most of these activities take place in restricted environments, such as military organizations, or require paying high training fees. In this paper we present an open-source architecture that makes it possible to easily conduct cybersecurity training, thus lowering the barrier to entry for a large number of students and IT professionals to benefit from such activities. The core element of our architecture is a set of mechanisms for automating the scenario progression management, thus enabling activities that combine attack, forensic and defense training in realistic scenarios. We present the design and implementation of the progression management module, and its interactions with the overall training framework into which it was integrated. Our evaluation of the architecture from both functionality and performance perspectives demonstrates that it meets the requirements for realistic training activities, and that progression management introduces only a low execution overhead."
9154757,Association Analysis-Based Cybersecurity Risk Assessment for Industrial Control Systems,"With the adoption of various information and communication technologies and commercial off-the-shelf components, industrial control systems (ICSs) become highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment (CSRA) plays a vital role in the security protection of ICSs. To reduce the complexity of the modeling process in the dynamic CSRA, an association analysis-based CSRA approach is proposed in this article. It designs a three-layer association network (AN) to infer the probabilities of security incidents. The parameters of the AN are derived through mining the data of historical attack records. From a distance correlation analysis of the process data of the target system, an association matrix is obtained between the system state variables and the key security variables to quantify the cybersecurity risk of the system. A case study is conducted on a coupling tanks control system to demonstrate the effectiveness and timeliness of the proposed approach."

9447833,A Survey of Deep Learning Techniques for Cybersecurity in Mobile Networks,"The widespread use of mobile devices, as well as the increasing popularity of mobile services has raised serious cybersecurity challenges. In the last years, the number of cyberattacks has grown dramatically, as well as their complexity. Traditional cybersecurity systems have failed to detect complex attacks, unknown malware, and they do not guarantee the preservation of user privacy. Consequently, cybersecurity systems have embraced Deep Learning (DL) models as they provide efficient detection of novel attacks and better accuracy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent cybersecurity works that use DL in mobile and wireless networks. It covers all cybersecurity aspects: infrastructure threads and attacks, software attacks and privacy preservation. First, we provide a detailed overview of DL techniques applied, or with potential applications, to cybersecurity. Then, we review cybersecurity works based on DL. For each cybersecurity threat or attack, we discuss the challenges for using DL methods. For each contribution, we review the implementation details and the performance of the solution. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first survey that provides a complete review of the DL methods for cybersecurity. Given the analysis performed, we identify the most effective DL methods for the different threats and attacks."
8676111,Flow Context and Host Behavior Based Shadowsocks’s Traffic Identification,"Cloud Virtual Private Server (VPS) services provide the chance of rapid deployment of anonymous proxy services, becoming an important part of many anonymous proxy solutions. The anonymous system represented by ShadowSocks (SS), through proxy services deployed on VPSs provided by different cloud service providers, has become an important mean for illegal network activists to engage in illegal network activities such as cyber-attacks and darknet transactions. It is difficult for local network administrators to supervise SS traffic from the cloud. While from the local network, the task faces the challenges of Invisible Negotiation Process and Data Transparent Transmission. In this paper, we present a novel SS detection method based on flow context and host behavior. The method can not only accurately identify SS flows, but also be applicable to a large-scale network environment. In this method, we extract 12-dimensional features from three aspects: the relationship between flows, hosts' flow behavior, and hosts' DNS behavior to build the detection model. Among them, the four features about flow burst and the feature of unassociated domain names' number are innovatively proposed in this paper. Moreover, the big data statistical and association techniques are used in the method. To verify the effectiveness of the method, we first built a real SS running environment based on the campus network and two VPSs on two different public cloud platforms. Moreover, we conduct a series of experiments on the NTCI-BDP data platform which is a big data platform built by our team. The experimental results show that our method achieves 93.43% accuracy on experimental data sets and can effectively identify SS traffic."

For subleasing their frequency slices to MVNOs, WIPs use their service level agreements (SLA) with MVNOs to divide and reconfigure their RF bands. Then, we use two stage game for maximizing the payoff of MVNOs and secrecy rates (aka payoff) of end users. The performance of the proposed game is evaluated using numerical results where MVNOs offer lowers price to attract more users or more requests from users and the end users adapt their strategies to improve their secrecy rates."
9664807,eChain: A Blockchain-enabled Ecosystem for Electronic Device Authenticity Verification,"Counterfeit electronic devices can cause a significant revenue loss and brand value damage to the original component manufacturers (OCM). In addition, they can instigate serious safety and security issues in critical military and space applications. These devices can be injected by untrusted entities in the supply chain, such as outsourced foundries, distributors, PCB assemblers, and system integrators. Existing methods for device authenticity verification are either destructive, require an advanced electrical test or physical inspection infrastructure. Furthermore, the existing database query-based verification systems by OCMs provide an illusion of authenticity verification by looking for a device record in their online system. In reality, a customer may have bought a cloned or recycled copy of an electronic device and may find a valid record in the OCM verification system. This paper presents a blockchain-centric solution to address these limitations to verify electronic devices. A detailed study is presented to transform an existing supply chain into a trustworthy distributed ledger framework called eChain (electronic Chain). eChain generates device provenance records from blockchain that users can utilize to classify authentic and counterfeit ICs. A fully functional prototype of eChain is developed to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed solution."

9502873,Cybersecurity Metrics for Human-Robot Collaborative Automotive Manufacturing,"A human-robot collaborative system was developed where a human co-worker and a collaborative robot collaborated to perform assembly tasks. We assumed such assembly tasks as the representative assembly tasks in the automotive manufacturing industry. We assumed that the collaborative assembly system would be a part of an industrial control system (ICS) in actual industrial environment. We recruited 20 human subjects to perform the assembly tasks in collaboration with the robot. We trained the subjects to enable them to perform the collaborative assembly tasks, and evaluate cybersecurity conditions (status) of the collaborative system. Each subject performed the collaborative assembly separately with the robot. At the end of the assembly task, each subject was asked to brainstorm, write down the cybersecurity assessment criteria as best as he/she could perceive or realize through his/her experiences with the collaborative system, and rate the cybersecurity status of the collaborative system for each of the criteria (i.e., how capable the collaborative system was in fulfilling the cybersecurity requirements for each criterion) using a five-point subjective rating scale (a Likert scale), where 1 indicated the least and 5 indicated the most secured system. We then analyzed the responses and determined a list of the tentative cybersecurity assessment criteria with their relative importance (the total frequency of each criterion proposed by the subjects was to indicate the importance level for that criterion). We also proposed how machine learning and data analytics could be applied to analyze the cybersecurity metrics and enhance cybersecurity in the collaborative system. The proposed cybersecurity metrics can serve as the preliminary effort towards developing comprehensive cybersecurity metrics and methods for human-robot collaborative assembly in automotive manufacturing in particular and for human-robot collaborative systems in general.

9349310,The Use of a Genetic Algorithm in the Problem of Distribution of Information Security Organizational and Financial Resources,"A model of the application of the genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the problem of multicriteria optimization in the distribution of resources allocated for the cybersecurity of the protected object is proposed. In the presented model, in contrast to the existing solutions, the Bellman-Zade principle is involved, which makes it possible to optimize the distribution, for example, of the organizational and financial resources of the protected object. It is shown that the use of GAs in the tasks of multicriteria optimization of cybersecurity resources will make it possible, based on multivariate simulation modeling, to select the optimal variant of resource allocation, which is especially important when these resources are limited in volume, and the defense side does not have data on the attackers’ resources."
9452797,A Study of Cybersecurity Education Using a Present-Test-Practice-Assess Model,"Contribution: Based on a previous exploratory study, this research further investigated learning mode contributions from simulations and live competitive activities compared to a traditional classroom, laboratory, and testing approach to instruction in order to assess the applied behavioral contributions of each. Background: Cybersecurity capabilities in organizations lag behind the threats; consequently, there is a renewed emphasis on cybersecurity education. However, education appears to lack its full potential in most settings. Few empirical studies have systematically tested the efficacy of various training methods and modes, and those that have been conducted have yielded inconsistent findings. Recent literature on the use of gamified simulations have suggested that they may improve cybersecurity behaviors. Similarly, live activities, such as hackathons and capture the flag events, have been surmised to augment learning and capabilities. This study sought to systematically investigate this question. Research Questions: 1) Do cybersecurity simulations improve applied learning performance; 2) do live competitive activities improve applied learning performance; and 3) do any or each of these modes amplify applied learning performance when used in combination? Methodology: This study randomly assigned computer science students to one of four sections using different modalities. It used pretest scores on an applied exam as the co-variate, with post-test scores as the dependent variable. Results: Simulations improved learning performance over traditional classroom/lab instruction alone whereas live competitive activities did not. However, the greatest learning outcomes achieved was structured cybersecurity simulated environments combined with live competitive activities."
9721733,An Intelligent Gamification Tool to Boost Young Kids Cybersecurity Knowledge on FB Messenger,"With the blind connectivity of many individuals across the Internet today, a lot of cyber-crimes and cyber-assaults occur in diverse forms. Cybersecurity knowledge among kids on Facebook Messenger within the ages of 6-12 years is a major concern due to their age group and perhaps their inability to manage security/privacy issues of their personal information and attitudes to issues while surfing the Facebook Messenger App. In view of this, this research first analysed recent issues regarding cybersecurity of young children, focusing more on Facebook Kids Messenger.

9728736,Cybersecurity Enhancement for Multi-Infeed High-Voltage DC Systems,"Composed of multiple two-terminal high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission systems, a multi-infeed HVDC (MIDC) system exchanges massive power among multiple asynchronous AC systems. However, as an intrinsically cyber-physical system, an MIDC system could suffer from cyber-attacks, leading to massive power mismatches in multiple AC systems, and resulting in catastrophic consequences. Since the sequential responses of an MIDC system and interconnected AC systems are in different timescales, this paper first establishes a two-timescale model to evaluate the sequential impacts caused by cyber-attacks. Then, an event-triggered cyber-defense strategy is proposed to enhance the cybersecurity of an MIDC system by mitigating multiple non-simultaneous cyber-attacks. Whenever new cyber-attack events occur, the proposed cyber-defense strategy, which is mathematically modeled as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem, is executed on-line and updated in an event-triggered manner. Simulation results on an MIDC system demonstrate that the low-cost and almost blind cyber-attacks can cause severe frequency deviations, and the proposed strategy can mitigate multi-cyber-attacks effectively."

9227142,12 Introduction,"stract:
Cybersecurity needs a change in communication. It is time to show the world that cybersecurity is an exciting and diverse field to work in. Cybersecurity is not only about hackers and technical gobbledygook. It is a diverse field of work with a lot of collaboration with other disciplines. Over the years, security professionals have tried different awareness strategies to promote their work and to improve the knowledge of their audience but without much success. Communication problems are holding back advances in in the field. Visual Communication for Cybersecurity explores the possibilities of visual communication as a tool to improve the communication about cybersecurity and to better connect with non-experts. Visual communication is useful to explain complex topics and to solve complex problems. Visual tools are easy to share through social media and have the possibility to reach a wide audience. When applied strategically, visual communication can contribute to a people-centric approach to security, where employees are encouraged to actively engage in security activities rather than simply complying with the policies. Cybersecurity education does not usually include communication theory or creative skills. Many experts think that it is not part of their job and is best left to the communication department or they think that they lack any creative talent. This book introduces communication theories and models, gives practical tips, and shows many examples. The book can support students in cybersecurity education and professionals searching for alternatives to bullet-point presentations and textual reports. On top of that, if this book succeeds in inspiring the reader to start creating visuals, it may also give the reader the pleasure of seeing new possibilities and improving their performance. The book is divided into different parts for readers with different interests. There is no need to read the book from cover to cover; the chapters are organized thematically...

9125213,"Cybersecurity Education and Skills: Exploring Students’ Perceptions, Preferences and Performance in a Blended Learning Initiative","Designing a cybersecurity course for a big cohort of students from the different educational background is a challenging job. Examined in this study are the perceptions, preferences and performance of students who have participated in a strategic blended learning initiative aimed at preparing students for their working lives. For this purpose, both self-reported and observational data were collected from 115 students who voluntarily registered for the pilot run of the course. Self-reported data was used to measure students’ preferences as well as perceptions related to satisfaction, engagement, convenience, interaction and views on learning. Observational data measuring students’ performance was directly extracted from the collaborative learning platform on which the course was hosted. The results show that overall students liked the blended design of the course. They were satisfied with the format of the course, they felt engaged, and most of them secured good grades. Moreover, no significant difference in perceptions and preferences were found when controlled for gender, educational discipline, and overall performance, showing that the blended design of the course was accepted across the board."
9458582,Measurable Challenges in Smart Grid Cybersecurity Enhancement: A Brief Review,"This paper aims to provide a brief summary of measurable factors affecting the adoption of cybersecurity enhancement techniques. From the practicality perspective, it is important to know that “to what degree” the cyber resilience will be improved by adopting a resilience enhancement scheme that requires a certain amount of financial investment. Numerous strategies have been proposed in different sets of literature to make smart grids more resilient against cyber attack. In this paper, the recent proposed techniques published within the past few years are further discussed in terms of three measurable factors including accuracy, computational time, and robustness with an emphasis on false data injection attacks. There is no single solution that would fit all needs in the power industry. Therefore, recently proposed attack detection and recognition schemes are compared and discussed quantitatively."
9177710,A New Approach to Fuzzy Regular Expression Parsers for Cybersecurity Logs,"As we move towards a zero-trust environment, collaborative intelligent systems are a vital tool in the cybersecurity workflow. These intelligent systems need to receive accurate and complete information from the multiplicity of low-level network monitoring systems. Typically, these low-level systems use regular expressions which are fast but not robust against minor changes - thus, information is often discarded. This paper outlines a new approach to low-level parsers, able to suggest new regular expression sequences and deal with approximate matching in an efficient way."

Finally, the paper discusses and recommends solutions for future work to decrease cyber-attacks in the medical field so that human health can be guaranteed."
9552043,Modeling and Simulation Approaches for Cybersecurity Impact Analysis: State-of-the-Art,"Designing resilient critical infrastructures involves ensuring the secure operation of the underlying systems and their components. Due to the ever-increasing integration of cyber components to monitor and control physical processes in such systems, cyberattacks can not only compromise the cyberinfrastructure but can also disrupt, delay, or thwart the physical processes and operations. Thus, a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment framework mandates analyzing the potential impact that successful exploits may have on such systems. In this paper, we survey the existing literature to aggregate the diverse modeling and simulation-based approaches that have been used to define and/or characterize the impact of attacks on cyber-physical and industrial control systems. The resulting analysis provides insight into the varying definitions of impact and domains of application, providing recommendations to guide future impact analysis studies."
9454089,Boosting Students and Teachers Cybersecurity Awareness During COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 Coronavirus originating from Wuhan, China has become a global pandemic. In order to protect their country's residents, governments worldwide have ordered schools and companies to close and for people to quarantine at home. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of digital devices and activity on the internet. Cybercriminals around the globe have seen this pandemic as an opportunity to initiate cyberattacks. This paper reviews the cyber threats that threaten users globally, as well as some of the attacks that have already occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then make suggestions to countermeasure these attacks and what can be done in the future to improve cybersecurity awareness and prevent them from occurring again."
8943833,Multilevel Unified Data Model for Critical Aviation Information Systems Cybersecurity,"Critical infrastructure protection currently is one of the priorities for the state. Especially this question is acutely raises for the states, that implementing new information and communication technologies in all critical areas. These technologies, amongst other things, generate new vulnerabilities and potential cyberthreats. For example, in civil aviation criticality level substantially amplified by increased degree of communication and interaction between ground and on-board aircraft systems. Known model of requirements formation for providing civil aviation security allows formalizing the process of creating complete requirements set, which should be done to protect civil aviation against cyberthreats. But there is no mechanism for determining provision of certain security mode by the implementation of methods and tools, that are declared in appropriate requirements. In this regard, multilevel unified data model was proposed in this paper. This model uses a basic approach to forming requirements for ensuring civil aviation cybersecurity, concatenation and binary-hexadecimal transformation of security features, defining security models set and security features subsets. It allows to formalize the identification process of requirements providing and to determine security modes of different critical aviation information systems including UAV."

In order to help SMEs to secure their business against such threats, various programs are developing all over Europe. We report here about the evolution of a Belgian program first anchored in good practices and self-assessment to a lightweight certification scheme fitting the needs and capabilities of SMEs. We present how the various means interconnect to form a maturity raising scale. We also detail some supporting tools for the current assessment and the future certification scheme."
8813712,Continuous Cybersecurity Management Through Blockchain Technology,"Traditional management practices applied to the cybersecurity realm are causing significant delays to the product release cycle for major organizations and government agencies. These delays are often seen as a necessary part of the security landscape to ensure appropriate approvals, audits, and risks are addressed prior to fielding software. However, the exact opposite outcome has been observed; delayed releases decrease overall security and functionality. This paper presents an alternative approval and review process using blockchain technology that complements agile development and continuous delivery paradigms. An example implementation is provided to demonstrate the behavior of the proposed system under hypothetical auditing and threat assessment scenarios."
9424999,A Cybersecurity Assessment Model for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,"The industrial environment is facing important changes from Industry 4.0 and requisite digital transformation. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) continue to introduce innovative and advanced Industry 4.0 technologies to improve their competitiveness. Industry 4.0 can provide a boost in efficiency, greater production flexibility through human–machine collaboration, and general agility.

It has been used to implement Controller Area Network (CAN) fuzz testing (a dynamic security test) via a prototype CAN fuzzer. The black-box fuzz testing of a laboratory vehicle's display ECU demonstrates the value of a fuzzer in the automotive field, revealing bugs in the ECU software, and weaknesses in the vehicle's systems design."
8769470,A Novel Cybersecurity Framework for Countermeasure of SME's in Saudi Arabia,"Cyber security is a core issue of the world. Every country and each organization is trying their best to defend their assets by spending a huge amount of their budget on Cybersecurity issues. It has been noticed that cyber security funds have not be utilized in a proper way to defend the assets of an organization. Each organization has their special needs and sensitivity to their assets. Some assets are critical to be protected in an organization while a few assets are trivial to be protected as organizational backup plan works. In this connection, we have proposed three basic models for Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs) and one holistic model to cover the needs in the life cycle of diverse SMEs. These models are based on the sensitivity of assets and organizational requirements. These model can be further assessed when extensive survey/interviews based on the target organization taken placed."
8895792,Crowdsourcing Approach for Developing Hands-On Experiments in Cybersecurity Education,"The operational skills are essential for the cybersecurity practitioners and the hands-on experiments can be utilized to train their practical skills. As malicious attacks are continually changing and new vulnerability appears quickly with the increasing number of new software, it has been a challenging problem to develop hands-on experiments rapidly and continuously which are consistent with realistic threat scenarios. Normally, skilled engineers are familiar with threat scenarios and the attack/defense skills, but they have no motivation to develop hands-on experiments for education. In contrast, the faculties are good at teaching and training but they have no resource or experience to deploy lots of hands-on experiments by themselves. In this paper, we propose a framework called RC 2 F by adopting the crowdsourcing approach, which acts as a platform for the engineers and the faculties as well as channels between them for resource exchanging. In the framework, we also introduce two incentive models to motivate the participants, where the constructor-oriented Forward Incentive Model (FIM for short) encourages the engineers by the incentive mechanism and the demand-oriented Backward Incentive Model (BIM for short) balances the educational resources for the faculties. We also provide a comprehensive case based on the practical data to analyze the proposed framework. And the results validate that the proposed framework as well as the FIM and BIM models can address the challenge in developing hands-on experiments."
9151814,Analysis of Cybersecurity Mechanisms with respect to Dependability and Security Attributes,"Embedded electronic systems need to be equipped with different types of security mechanisms to protect themselves and to mitigate the effects of cybersecurity attacks. These mechanisms should be evaluated with respect to their impacts on dependability and security attributes such as availability, reliability, safety, etc. The evaluation is of great importance as, e.g., a security mechanism should never violate the system safety. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate a comprehensive set of security mechanisms consisting of 17 different types of mechanisms with respect to their impact on dependability and security attributes. The results show that, in general, the use of these mechanisms have positive effect on system dependability and security. However, there are at least three mechanisms that could have negative impacts on system dependability by violating safety and availability requirements. The results support our claim that the analyses such as the ones conducted in this paper are necessary when selecting and implementing an optimal set of safety and security mechanisms."
8786028,Leveraging SecDevOps to Tackle the Technical Debt Associated with Cybersecurity Attack Tactics,"Context: Managing technical debt (TD) associated with external cybersecurity attacks on an organization can significantly improve decisions made when prioritizing which security weaknesses require attention. Whilst source code vulnerabilities can be found using static analysis techniques, malicious external attacks expose the vulnerabilities of a system at runtime and can sometimes remain hidden for long periods of time. By mapping malicious attack tactics to the consequences of weaknesses (i.e. exploitable source code vulnerabilities) we can begin to understand and prioritize the refactoring of the source code vulnerabilities that cause the greatest amount of technical debt on a system. Goal: To establish an approach that maps common external attack tactics to system weaknesses. The consequences of a weakness associated with a specific attack technique can then be used to determine the technical debt principal of said violation; which can be measured in terms of loss of business rather than source code maintenance. Method: We present a position study that uses Jaccard similarity scoring to examine how 11 malicious attack tactics can relate to Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). Results: We conduct a study to simulate attacks, and generate dependency graphs between external attacks and the technical consequences associated with CWEs. Conclusion: The mapping of cyber security attacks to weaknesses allows operational staff (SecDevOps) to focus on deploying appropriate countermeasures and allows developers to focus on refactoring the vulnerabilities with the greatest potential for technical debt."

This is followed by a description of the ""life"" of a new type of Security and Cybersecurity and Standardisation Security Issues. The conclusory part deals with the cybersecurity interest and content area."
9478241,A Census of Swedish Public Sector Employee Communication on Cybersecurity during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of the Swedish public sector, and to ensure the success of this ongoing process cybersecurity plays an integral part. While Sweden has come far in digitalization, the maturity of cybersecurity work across entities covers a wide range. One way of improving cybersecurity is through communication, thereby enhancing employee cyber situation awareness. In this paper, we conduct a census of Swedish public sector employee communication on cybersecurity at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic using questionnaires. The study shows that public sector entities find the same sources of information useful for their cybersecurity work. We find that nearly two thirds of administrative authorities and almost three quarters of municipalities are not yet at the implemented cybersecurity level. We also find that 71 % of municipalities have less than one dedicated staff for cybersecurity."
9000440,An Example of a Cybersecurity Education Model,"IT technology is a vital part of our everyday life and society. Additionally, as it is present in strategic domains like the military, healthcare or critical infrastructure, the aspect of protection, i.e. cybersecurity is of utmost importance. In recent years, the demand for cybersecurity experts is exponentially rising. Additionally, the field of cybersecurity is very much interdisciplinary and therefore requires a broad set of skills.

9020332,Security Tag Fields and Control Flow Management,"Cybersecurity community now faces advanced threats: Rowhammer, Spectre, Meltdown, Foreshadow, PortSmash, and future unknown threats. Current cybersecurity threats have led to a renewed interest in security tag fields and program control flow. Security tag fields have their roots in 1950's era hardware for system reliability. Today, there is great interest in tags for hardware-based cybersecurity. Current commodity microprocessors execute instructions. Future cybersecurity architectures need to understand and manage security. We investigate using security tag fields to enforce some control flow properties."
8802745,"“What”, “Where”, and “Why” Cybersecurity Controls to Enforce for Optimal Risk Mitigation","Most enterprises depend on information security standards and guidelines such as CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS CSC)to adopt and manage cybersecurity controls. With the escalation and diversity of cyber attacks, hundreds of cybersecurity controls have been defined to implement NIST Cybersecurity Framework (i.e., Identify, Detect, Protect, Respond, and Recover)[1]. However, the selection of the most appropriate set of security controls to optimize cyber defense Return on Investment (ROI)is still a highly complex and error-prone task due to the large number of security controls, the consideration of various risk factors (such as vulnerabilities and attack incidents), and budget constraints. Moreover, the complexity exacerbates due to the presence of various enterprise-oriented usability requirements. In this paper, we present a novel model and optimization techniques to select the most cost-effective set of Critical Security Controls (CSC) for optimal risk mitigation planning considering affordable residual risk, budget, and usability constraints. We developed Cyber Defense Matrix (CDM), that our automated approach uses to determine “what” security controls are needed at a particular enterprise for security function (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover), “where” to enforce in the cyber environment (Network, Device, People, Application, and Data), and “why” it is effective in the cyber attack kill chain phases. We formulate the CDM decision-making problem using SMT constraints and developed a tool, called CyberARM, that computes correct-by-construction planning to satisfy cybersecurity ROI with bounded residual risk under specific budget constraints."
9261465,Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cybersecurity Assessment of Wind Integrated Power Systems,"The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) is rapidly increasing in electric power systems (EPS). While the inclusion of intermittent RES coupled with the wide-scale deployment of communication and sensing devices is important towards a fully smart grid, it has also expanded the cyber-threat landscape, effectively making power systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This article proposes a cybersecurity assessment approach designed to assess the cyberphysical security of EPS. The work takes into consideration the intermittent generation of RES, vulnerabilities introduced by microprocessor-based electronic information and operational technology (IT/OT) devices, and contingency analysis results. The proposed approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an adapted Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score tailored to assess vulnerabilities in EPS in order to identify the optimal attack transition policy based on
N−2
contingency results, i.e., the simultaneous failure of two system elements. The effectiveness of the work is validated via numerical and real-time simulation experiments performed on literature-based power grid test cases. The results demonstrate how the proposed method based on deep
Q
-network (
DQN
) performs closely to a graph-search approach in terms of the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack policy, without the need for full observation of the system. In addition, the experiments present the method's scalability by showcasing the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack transition policy in a large system such as the Polish 2383 bus test system. The results exhibit how the proposed approach requires one order of magnitude fewer transitions when compared to a random transition policy."

8813669,FACTS Approach to Address Cybersecurity Issues in Electric Vehicle Battery Systems,"Regulations and standards define requirements for the development of every component in an Electric Vehicle (EV). Standards are meant to ensure healthy competition among the stakeholders and enhance consumer safety. Frameworks for the development and testing of the overall EVs have been developed, but they do not address the requirements of each component individually from cybersecurity perspective. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and connected devices, cybersecurity issues and attacks are coming into notice. This evolution requires a defined framework which addresses cybersecurity issues in EVs. Till date, only a generic EV standard (SAE J3061) has been developed. Battery Management Systems (BMS) which control the key component of an EV, the battery stacks, currently do not have a standard that could address their cybersecurity issues. The Framework for Analysis, Comparison, and Test of Standards (FACTS), is presented in this paper after identifying the key player in EV cybersecurity by comparing existing frameworks. The development approach and steps applicable to EV BMS's for obtaining technical requirements and comparing testing standards are also presented. Finally, a fault tree analysis is also developed to validate the approach based on the technical requirements considered for the framework development."

9368731,Cybersecurity Assessment Using Delay from Backlog Bound Calculation,"During the last decade, cybersecurity assessment has become a key issue among all security problems encountered in designing and managing complex systems. Today, for dealing with cybersecurity, many sophisticated models are available. Still, the classic CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability remains actual and useful. In this article, following the CIA model, we investigate cybersecurity of control systems. After some research, we make it clear that availability is the most critical property of cybersecurity in the operational technology context, and so can be used as an indicator of cybersecurity. Conducting a review of availability definitions, we elect a proper interpretation of availability with a delay as a measure for its evaluation. For calculations, we use a theory of deterministic queueing systems Network calculus, but in contrast to the common practice of delay calculation through the bounds of the arrival flow and service, we investigate another critical case where a delay can be estimated from the knowledge of the backlog bound and the framework of service curves. A problem for systems with a linear relationship between the minimum and maximum service curves and a special case of rate-latency service curves are examined."
9570208,Industry Engagement for Identification of Cybersecurity Needs Practices for Digital Twins,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are helping to make smart cities a reality, thanks to technological advancements in the construction industry. Through use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT), CPS integrates information and the physical world. Integrating Building Information Models (BIM) with IoT and sensor using CPS is becoming a more common goal in the industry. The adoption of digital twins in the future will open up new opportunities for CPS using tracking, simulation, and optimization strategies. Researchers, on the other hand, often overlook the cybersecurity implications. Assimilation of BIM data and cybersecurity principles has been difficult so far, and as a result, cybersecurity has been neglected. Specifically, this research will address research question; What are the key cybersecurity needed practices of built environment stakeholders? To answer these questions, this paper will survey the research of adoption of the cyber-physical system and digital twins regarding the industry. and determine obstacles to the adoption of cybersecurity for digital twins/CPS in the built environment. The findings of this study validated the value of using digital twins in industry. As a result, this paper assesses the use of digital twins in CPSs in order to determine the practices for bolstering cybersecurity and integrating digital twin and city standards in future urban cities."
8780260,Cybersecurity Analysis of Industrial Control System Functionality,"The cybersecurity issue becomes increasingly important with the development of the Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industrial 4.0 architectures. The instance of cyberattacks against infrastructures and Industrial Control System (ICS) in safety critical domains is increasing every year. How to alleviate this situation is a challenging topic. In many cases, threats to cybersecurity are only discovered after they have led to a disaster. In this paper, we are going to analyze those cybersecurity issues from the system functionality, before an attack happens. Except for considering confidentiality and availability, functional integrity and information integrity are involved as well. This allows a precise determination of cybersecurity issues during the analysis process (from the system function perspective). A safety critical ICS in a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) is used as an example to show how to conduct the cybersecurity analysis step by step.

9097899,Analyzing Students’ Self-Perception of Success and Learning Effectiveness Using Gamification in an Online Cybersecurity Course,"This paper analyzes students' self-perception of success and learning effectiveness after using non-compulsory gamification in an online Cybcourse. For this purpose, we designed a cybersecurity game based on cognitive constructivism learning theory. We built the game scenes using metaphors to present the main Cybersecurity contents to the students. We delivered the game in a regular course with two objectives: first, to find the primary design factors that affect students' self-perception of success. We propose a structural equation model to find out the elements with the most significant impact on the students' self-perception of success. The results show that the realistic game design and the contextualization of the game do have a notable influence. They are both examples of best practices in game design; second, to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the game. The results suggest a high correlation between playing the game and succeeding in the course. Moreover, chronological analysis of the performance reveals that the intention to play the game could be a simple dropout predictor. Thus, introducing the game in the educational curricula improves student engagement and consolidates their knowledge on cybersecurity."
9280671,A three-year retrospective on offering an embedded systems course with a focus on cybersecurity,"The fast pace of advancement in fields of computer science and engineering creates enormous opportunities for the use and application of computing devices. The internet of things (IoT) constitutes an area experiencing significant growth. If IoT systems are not configured and used correctly, there is potential for widespread disruption and harm due to cyberattacks. Hence, the new generation of professionals in the field of computer technology needs to be conversant with cybersecurity and the design of protection of computer systems. Cybersecurity is not restricted to a specific domain such as hardware or software and needs to address all aspects of operation of computer systems. Consequently, we have found it beneficial to introduce students to cybersecurity through an embedded systems course. Based on three years of teaching cybersecurity to students in an embedded systems course, we observe that students are excited and motivated to participate in hands-on lab exercises. We have taken special care to orient these lab exercises to breaking news articles about developments related to safety and cybersecurity. We also found it helpful to unify multiple lab exercises around a specific target application domain such as healthcare or retail. Our results over a three-year period demonstrate that it is possible to teach essential cybersecurity concepts within a one-semester course to students who do not have prior exposure to this area. This knowledge needs to be expanded upon in other courses, thereby weaving a thread of cybersecurity through the students' educational experience."

9303356,A Comprehensive Study of the IoT Cybersecurity in Smart Cities,"Smart cities exploit emerging technologies such as Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance public services management. The use of IoT allows detecting and reporting specific parameters related to different domains of the city, such as health, waste management, agriculture, transportation, and energy. LoRa technologies, for instance, are used to develop IoT solutions for several smart city domains thanks to its available features, but sometimes people (i.e., citizens, information technology administrators, or city managers) might think that these available features involve cybersecurity risks. This study explores the cybersecurity aspects that define an assessment model of cybersecurity maturity of IoT solutions to develop smart city applications. In that sense, we perform a systematic literature review based on a top-down approach of cybersecurity incident response in IoT ecosystems. Besides, we propose and validate a model based on risk levels to evaluate the IoT cybersecurity maturity in a smart city."
9229751,Learning Analytics Perspective: Evidencing Learning from Digital Datasets in Cybersecurity Exercises,"Cybersecurity exercises are gaining in popularity in university curricula and professional training paths and are seen as an effective teaching method. Such exercises provide digital datasets to facilitate a learning analytics approach such as by using the traces that learners leave behind to improve the learning process and environment. While there are various learning measurement efforts from digital datasets in the existing literature, a holistic learning analytics approach incorporated into cybersecurity exercises is still lacking. We propose a practical reference model for incorporating a learning analytics approach into the cybersecurity exercise life-cycle. To facilitate this application, we have performed an extensive review of existing academic research on applying learning analytics in the context of cybersecurity exercises. We specifically focus on the learning indicators used to measure empirical impact and training effectiveness that could indicate achievement of defined learning outcomes. This reference model and overview of existing learning analytics use cases and learning metrics in various types of exercises can help educators, organisers and cyber range developers. This results in more adaptive exercise design and measurement using evidence-based data and connects digital learning traces to skills and competencies."
9368459,"Exploring the Relationship Between Collaborative Discourse, Programming Actions, and Cybersecurity and Computational Thinking Knowledge","Computational thinking (CT) skills are necessary for solving the real-world problems of today and are therefore being incorporated into K-12 curricula. Cybersecurity is of similar importance; however, it can be difficult for young learners to grasp the required concepts and use them to construct meaningful algorithms. We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development. We discuss the impact of this approach on cybersecurity and CT learning and then present future directions for this work."

8998491,Towards an Improved Understanding of Human Factors in Cybersecurity,"Cybersecurity cannot be addressed by technology alone; the most intractable aspects are in fact sociotechnical. As a result, the 'human factor' has been recognised as being the weakest and most obscure link in creating safe and secure digital environments. This study examines the subjective and often complex nature of human factors in the cybersecurity context through a systematic literature review of 27 articles which span across technical, behavior and social sciences perspectives. Results from our study suggest that there is still a predominately a technical focus, which excludes the consideration of human factors in cybersecurity. Our literature review suggests that this is due to a lack of consolidation of the attributes pertaining to human factors; the application of theoretical frameworks; and a lack of in-depth qualitative studies. To ensure that these gaps are addressed, we propose that future studies take into consideration (a) consolidating the human factors; (b) examining cyber security from an interdisciplinary approach; (c) conducting additional qualitative research whilst investigating human factors in cybersecurity."
9300139,Analytical Review of Cybersecurity for Embedded Systems,"To identify the key factors and create the landscape of cybersecurity for embedded systems (CSES), an analytical review of the existing research on CSES has been conducted. The common properties of embedded systems, such as mobility, small size, low cost, independence, and limited power consumption when compared to traditional computer systems, have caused many challenges in CSES. The conflict between cybersecurity requirements and the computing capabilities of embedded systems makes it critical to implement sophisticated security countermeasures against cyber-attacks in an embedded system with limited resources, without draining those resources. In this study, twelve factors influencing CSES have been identified: (1) the components; (2) the characteristics; (3) the implementation; (4) the technical domain; (5) the security requirements; (6) the security problems; (7) the connectivity protocols; (8) the attack surfaces; (9) the impact of the cyber-attacks; (10) the security challenges of the ESs; (11) the security solutions; and (12) the players (manufacturers, legislators, operators, and users). A Multiple Layers Feedback Framework of Embedded System Cybersecurity (MuLFESC) with nine layers of protection is proposed, with new metrics of risk assessment. This will enable cybersecurity practitioners to conduct an assessment of their systems with regard to twelve identified cybersecurity aspects. In MuLFESC, the feedback from the system-components layer to the system-operations layer could help implement “Security by Design” in the design stage at the bottom layer. The study provides a clear landscape of CSES and, therefore, could help to find better comprehensive solutions for CSES."
9729835,"Are You a Cyborg, Bot or Human?—A Survey on Detecting Fake News Spreaders","One of the major components of Societal Digitalization is Online social networks (OSNs). OSNs can expose people to different popular trends in various aspects of life and alter people’s beliefs, behaviors, and decisions and communication. Social bots and malicious users are the significant sources for spreading misinformation on social media and can pose serious cyber threats in society. The degree of similarity of user profiles of a cyber bot and a malicious user spreading fake news is so great that it is very difficult to differentiate both based on their attributes. Over the years, researchers have attempted to find a way to mitigate this problem. However, the detection of fake news spreaders across OSNs remains a challenge. In this paper, we have provided a comprehensive survey of the state of art methods for detecting malicious users and bots based on different features proposed in our novel taxonomy. We have also aimed to avert the crucial problem of fake news detection by discussing several key challenges and potential future research areas to help researchers who are new to this field."

9667309,Cybersecurity attacks on software logic and error handling within ADS-B implementations: Systematic testing of resilience and countermeasures,"Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a cornerstone of the next-generation digital sky and is now mandated in several countries. However, there have been many reports of serious security vulnerabilities in the ADS-B architecture. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate the impact of multiple cyberattacks on ADS-B via remote radio frequency links that affected various network, processing, and display subsystems used within the ADS-B ecosystem. Overall we implemented and tested 12 cyberattacks on ADS-B in a controlled environment, out of which 5 attacks were presented or implemented for the first time. For all these attacks, we developed a unique testbed that consisted of 13 hardware devices and 22 software that ran on Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems, which result in a total of 36 tested configurations. Each of the attacks was successful on various subsets of the tested configurations. In some attacks, we discovered wide qualitative variations and discrepancies in how particular configurations react to and treat ADS-B inputs that contain errors or contradicting flight information, with the main culprit almost always being the software implementation. In some other attacks, we managed to cause Denial of Service (DoS) by remotely crashing/impacting more than 50% of the test-set that corresponded to those attacks. Besides demonstrating successful attacks, we also implemented, investigated, and report herein some practical countermeasures to these attacks. We demonstrated that the strong relationship between the received signal strength and the distance-to-emitter might help verify the aircrafts advertised ADS-B position and distance. For example, our best machine learning models achieved 90% accuracy in detecting spoofed ADS-B signals, which may be effectively used to distinguish ADS-B signals of real aircraft from spoofed signals of attackers."

9478213,The Cybersecurity (CSEC) Questionnaire: Individual Differences in Unintentional Insider Threat Behaviours,"The present study identifies a number of individual difference traits that are related to cyber hygiene behaviour in order to develop a brief questionnaire. The resulting questionnaire identifies basic vulnerabilities in users' practices consisting of updating software, changing passwords, and disclosure of information on social media platforms (SMPs). Using existing scales assessing individual differences (i.e., conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness, regulatory focus), we argue that the cybersecurity scale (CSEC) can be used to identify individuals within an organization that need remedial education and training. Moreover, CSEC scores differentiate between assessment disclosure vulnerability and intrusion vulnerability, allowing for the identification of different kinds of cybersecurity practices."

In this research, we proposed building an autonomous system for extracting cyber threat information from publicly available information sources. We tested a neural embedding method called doc2vec as a natural language filter for the proposed system. With cybersecurity-specific training data and custom preprocessing, we were able to train a doc2vec model and evaluate its performance. According to our evaluation, the natural language filter was able to identify cybersecurity specific natural language text with 83% accuracy."

9476132,"A Survey on the Role of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Cybersecurity Attack Detection","With the growing internet services, cybersecurity becomes one of the major research problems of the modern digital era. Cybersecurity involves techniques to protect and control the systems, hardware, software, network, and electronic data from unauthorized access. It is necessary to build a cyber-security system to detect different types of attacks. Implementing various intelligent algorithms in cybersecurity led to detect and analyz attack actions occurring in field of computer networks. Cybersecurity uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms capable of extracting optimal feature representation from the big data set. This has been applied to various cybersecurity cases, such as attacks detection, prediction, and analysis. This work aims to perform an analysis of cybersecurity attacks datasets by using intelligent approaches. It also provides a detailed comparison with the performance of algorithms, field implementation to describe network protection optimization technologies benefits."
8852142,Collecting Indicators of Compromise from Unstructured Text of Cybersecurity Articles using Neural-Based Sequence Labelling,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are artifacts observed on a network or in an operating system that can be utilized to indicate a computer intrusion and detect cyber-attacks in an early stage. Thus, they exert an important role in the field of cybersecurity. However, state-of-the-art IOCs detection systems rely heavily on hand-crafted features with expert knowledge of cybersecurity, and require large-scale manually annotated corpora to train an IOC classifier. In this paper, we propose using an end-to-end neural-based sequence labelling model to identify IOCs automatically from cybersecurity articles without expert knowledge of cybersecurity. By using a multi-head self-attention module and contextual features, we find that the proposed model is capable of gathering contextual information from texts of cybersecurity articles and performs better in the task of IOC identification. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms other sequence labelling models, achieving the average F1-score of 89.0% on English cybersecurity article test set, and approximately the average F1-score of 81.8% on Chinese test set."
8931384,Toward a Blockchain-based Platform to Manage Cybersecurity Certification of IoT devices,"The goal of this paper is to propose a blockchain-based platform to enhance transparency and traceability of cybersecurity certification information motivated by the recently adopted EU Cybersecurity Act. The proposed platform is generic and intended to support the trusted exchange of cybersecurity certification information for any electronic product, service, or process. However, for the purposes of this paper, we focus on the case study of the cybersecurity certification of IoT devices, which are explicitly referenced in the recently adopted Cybersecurity Act as one of the main domains where it is highlighted the need for an increased level of trust."
9438369,Attended-over Distributed Specificity for Information Extraction in Cybersecurity,"Cybersecurity has become a critical necessity in aerospace, especially given the recent prevalent utilization of cyberspace as well as computing infrastructure, tools, and platforms in the domain. Cybersecurity relies on the timely discovery of potential and active vulnerabilities to mitigate threats, cyberattacks and theft of intellectual property. These vulnerabilities are commonly communicated via textual channels which can be mined and detected by information extraction techniques, such as Automatic Terminology Extraction (ATE), in order to mitigate imminent and future attacks. Distributed Specificity, a modern and highly effective ATE paradigm, was first introduced by [4], [3] and further improved by [21]. These methods, however, regard the context words linearly and indiscriminately, which 1) disregards the non-linear relations among the context words and 2) assigns an equal weight to each word edge in the sequence despite the fact that the connections of the nodes are not of equal strength. As our first contribution, the present article addresses this shortcoming by integrating the self-attention mechanism into the distributed specificity paradigm to enhance candidate terms' representation resulting in a more accurate extraction, which in turn lends itself to the higher coverage and a more timely discovery of cyberattacks. Since no ATE dataset exists in the cybersecurity domain, to the best of our knowledge, the present endeavor offers a dataset, as its second contribution, that will be the benchmark for our experiments and the ones to follow by both ATE and cybersecurity research communities. This complements the SemEval's SecureNLP [35] information extraction repository. We extend the MalwareTextDB (comprised of 147 cybersecurity reports) to include labeled terminologies as ground truth. The labeled dataset is annotated by cybersecurity practitioners using Term Evaluator [25]. Although for most industries higher coverage and a more timely discovery of cyber...

9174921,An Actuarial Framework for Power System Reliability Considering Cybersecurity Threats,"Cybersecurity has become an emerging issue for the secure operation of power systems. Besides hardening the power system to improve its cybersecurity, cyber insurance is emerging as a promising tool in cyber risk management. In this paper, an actuarial framework is established to capture and reduce the riskiness raised by interdependence among cyber risks, with the aim to enhance cyber insurance market for power systems. Absorbing semi-Markov process (SMP) is proposed to model the cyberattacks on the power grid. Also a stochastic model is developed to reflect the correlation of cyber risks across the power system. A sequential Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) framework is developed to evaluate the interruptions of the power system considering both the physical failures of the components and malicious cyberattacks. Then, the detailed insurance schemes are designed to manage the risks of the power system considering the financial consequences of cybersecurity threats. Case studies are conducted on a test system based on the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS-79) to illustrate the application of the proposed insurance pricing schemes."
9449758,Cybersecurity of Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Management Systems,"In concept, a smart charging management system (SCMS) optimizes the charging of plug-in vehicles (PEVs) and provides various grid services including voltage control, frequency regulation, peak shaving, renewable energy integration support, spinning reserve, and emergency demand response. These functionalities largely depend upon data collected from various entities such as PEVs, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), service providers, and utilities. SCMS can be susceptible to both cyber and physical threats (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack, data intrigued attack, denial of charging, physical-attack) due to interactions of and interdependencies between cyber and physical components. Cyber-physical threats through highly connected malware vectors raise various concerns including public safety hazards to vehicle operators and those in the immediate vicinity as well as disruptions to electric grid operations. This paper describes the concept of SCMS and provides a comprehensive review of cybersecurity aspects of EVSEs and SCMSs with their possible impacts on the power grid and society. It also contributes to the development of cybersecurity measures to the SCMSs. Various functions of SCMS are reviewed in detail including peak shaving, demand charge reduction, frequency regulation, spinning reserve, renewable integration support, distribution congestion management, reactive power compensation, and emergency demand response with unidirectional PEVs charging. Also, a critical literature survey on current practices of SCMS cybersecurity is provided to explore major impacts and challenges of cyber-physical attacks and to identify research gaps and vulneraibilities in currently available SCMSs technologies."
8753872,Cybersecurity as a Centralized Directed System of Systems Using SoS Explorer as a Tool,"The vast advancements in computing technology and the profound reliance on inter-connected systems has led to a significant growth of cyber-attack incidents. The incidents can propagate from within or outside of organizations, thus ensuing detrimental consequences such as business conducting disruptions, market brand degradation, settlement charges, regulatory compliance issues, etc. The ability to withstand such interference is essential to maintaining a vital and competitively advantageous organization. This paper analyzes coexisting vulnerabilities and the utilization of innovative and effective mechanisms to identify and block undesirable emergence through a centrally controlled and directed SoS approach. The paper will use SoS Explorer as a tool to architect, model and optimize the many objective cybersecurity complex system dealing with securing from exploiting threats through threat-inhibiting systems. The tool provides an intuitive and interactive visualization enabling the user to produce “what-if” analysis on various scenarios, especially for time evolving dynamics of cybersecurity, through generated optimization functional architecture solutions. The paper will further discuss vulnerability exploitation and cybersecurity implications on banking domain describing speculative observations followed by future research directions."
9116415,A Study on Cybersecurity Challenges in E-learning and Database Management System,"Education is gradually moving from traditional classroom-based setting to online-based. E-learning has become the topic of discussion as far as cybersecurity is concerned. E-learning as a mode of acquiring knowledge and skills through electronic means, cannot be achieved without internet technology. In other words, it depends largely on the internet technology for the sharing of ideas and information. However, the network environment is a home for hackers and the internet fraudless. As the reach of the internet expands to cover ever broader aspects of our education and social welfare, cybersecurity is the major concern when dealing with privacy, authentication, and confidentiality of user’s information stored in a database server. Most often hackers release attacks designed to steal confidential data and an organization’s database servers are the targets of these attacks because they are the core of any organization, storage bank. Hence, it is very important to put strong security measures in place to protect the data and information of the end-user against any malicious attack. This paper, therefore, aimed to discuss cybersecurity issues related to the e-learning management system, the significance of the e-Learning, and the Database Management System. Again the paper discusses top security issues in databases and how to lessen them."

The measures system of corresponding threats counteraction is suggested."
8758411,Addressing Industry 4.0 Cybersecurity Challenges,"Awareness is building on how managers should be involved in Industry 4.0 cybersecurity. This awareness and concern derives from heavy dependence of integrated information systems and technology for Industry 4.0. Manufacturing companies rely on data to run their operations. The Internet of Things is exponentially increasing the number of entry points for organizations to defend from nefarious actors. Complex digital value chains expose firms to risks beyond their direct control. The potential damage of cyberattacks is substantial in terms of continuity of business operations, theft of confidential information, and reputational harm. Even with this mounting sense of urgency, there is increasing confusion on what needs to be done and how. C-suite executives and entrepreneurs are puzzled due to the complexity of issues and concerns. Cybersecurity professionals, for their part, often fail to make the issue relevant and accessible to non-technical stakeholders. In this paper, we clarify why Industry 4.0 requires an evolving cybersecurity perspective. We identify where current approaches fall short and what emerging practices are gaining relevance. Our analysis is based on discussions with senior executives and an extensive literature review of academic papers and practical reports."
9548649,Combined Outsourcing of Accounting and Cybersecurity Authorities,"The intensification of cyber threats as a result of global hybrid conflicts, the emergence of the digital economy, and pandemic changes in the way employees perform their duties requires the development of effective means of cyber defense of the enterprise. Since the main generator of economic information at the micro level is accounting, accounting information systems need priority cybersecurity. Combined (integrated) outsourcing of accounting and cybersecurity, which helps to optimize the business processes of the enterprise, minimize administrative costs, reduce the likelihood of information and financial risks, has been developed.The information scheme of the combined (mosaic) organizational variant of outsourcing is developed, which lies in combining features of functional and structural variants of outsourcing with mosaic delegation of financial and management accounting and security functions to many different outsourcers. With the help of blockchain technology, disparate accounting information is integrated and transmitted to the accounting and management of the enterprise for further processing. The implementation of the proposed model provides comprehensive outsourcing of financial and management accounting and security functions with an effective system of cybersecurity."
9178780,Efficient HEVC Integrity Verification Scheme for Multimedia Cybersecurity Applications,"Multimedia cybersecurity is a prevalent research topic in the digital world due to the rapid progress of digital multimedia and Internet applications. Watermarking, encryption, and steganography schemes are employed to attain multimedia data confidentiality and robustness. However, these schemes are externally applied on trusted computers, and there has been a lack of similar schemes that can be effectively and efficiently enabled through an untrusted transmission medium. In this work, a self-embedding-based High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) transmission and integrity verification framework is presented. This framework is robust and reliable for verifying the integrity of HEVC frames transmitted through insecure communication channels. Firstly, the transmitted HEVC frames are divided into a number of blocks with a certain block size. After that, a discrete transform is used for self-embedding of watermarks from each block into another one depending on a predefined mechanism. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) are tested for this task. The watermarked HEVC frames are transmitted through a wireless communication channel, and hence they become subject to different attacks and corruptions. At the receiver side, the secret watermarks in each block are sensed with a correlation-based method to discover dubious counterfeit operations. To verify the reliability of the suggested transmission framework and its ability to achieve high protection and robust content verification of the transmitted HEVC frames over insecure communication channels, different HEVC analyses and comparisons are performed. Simulation results demonstrate the suitability of the suggested transmission framework for different multimedia cybersecurity applications. Furthermore, the comparative analysis shows that the DFT is an efficient discrete transform that can be employed with the proposed transmission framework to guarantee a h...

9385530,Traffic Analysis in Support of Hybrid SDN Campus Architectures for Enhanced Cybersecurity,The scale and complexity of campus networks continues to accelerate due to recent paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) resulting in a heightened awareness of the need for enhanced cybersecurity. Traditional cybersecurity approaches such as the placement of firewalls and other policy enforcement mechanisms at strategic choke points effectively divide the network into zones and are unable to regulate intrazone host-to-host communication. This traditional approach introduces significant risk as there is little in place to prevent the horizontal propagation of malware or other unwanted traffic within a given zone. In this paper we explore approaches for improving cybersecurity in campus networks by analyzing contemporary campus traffic patterns and propose several architectural enhancements in light of these patterns which introduce strategically placed hardware or hardware-accelerated software data planes which are evaluated from performance and effectiveness perspectives.
8990336,To Coerce or Not to Coerce? A Quantitative Investigation on Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Legislations Towards Large-Scale Vulnerability Notifications,"The rise of large-scale vulnerability scanners, which make the detection of vulnerabilities easy, has recently raised the attention to the security community. This leads to multiple research on the effectiveness of large-scale vulnerability notifications as a countermeasure and several studies have examined the different factors that could impact the effectiveness and how they could incite people to apply vulnerability fixing steps. And we contend that using a legal constraint could improve the vulnerability fixing rate. In this paper, we survey the Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Legislations of 156 countries looking for Articles that consider the liability of vulnerable resource owners. We discovered that only two countries required companies, regardless of the industry, to implement cybersecurity measures and conduct vulnerability assessments. This study aims to define a more effective large-scale vulnerability notifications system using Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Laws."
9458190,A Survey of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity,"During the last decades, not only the number of cyberattacks have increased significantly, they have also become more sophisticated. Hence designing a cyber-resilient approach is of paramount importance. Traditional security methods are not adequate to prevent data breaches in case of cyberattacks. Cybercriminals have learned how to use new techniques and robust tools to hack, attack, and breach data. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been introduced into cyberspace to construct smart models for defending systems from attacks. Since AI technologies can rapidly evolve to address complex situations, they can be used as fundamental tools in the field of cybersecurity. Al-based techniques can provide efficient and powerful cyber defense tools to recognize malware attacks, network intrusions, phishing and spam emails, and data breaches, to name a few, and to alert security incidents when they occur. In this paper, we review the impact of AI in cybersecurity and summarize existing research in terms of benefits of AI in cybersecurity."

This paper describes a novel Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment Framework (CMAF) that is tailored to the NIS Directive requirements. CMAF can be used either as a self assessment tool from Operators of Essential Services and Digital Service Providers or as an audit tool from the National Competent Authorities for cybersecurity"
9425225,Determining the Impact of Cybersecurity Failures During and Attributable to Pandemics and Other Emergency Situations,"In emergency situations, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, less immediate concerns such as cybersecurity and long-term economic impact can fall by the wayside. This paper presents a discussion of the impact of cybersecurity issues that occur during and are attributable to pandemics and other emergency situations. This discussion is facilitated by a simulation tool, the Disaster Vulnerability Threat and Impact Simulator System (DVTISS). DVTISS simulates the network structure, security measures, user characteristics and demographics, data, and devices of an organization or region's computing infrastructure. The system is provided input parameters and performs analysis to identify the combined results of numerous different decisions, which are made in concert, to identify the types of vulnerabilities that may be present and the impact of their exploitation. The impacts of system unavailability are considered. This can aid businesses, governments and others in determining the level of prioritization that should be given to cybersecurity considerations. The simulator can also be used for disaster preparedness and planning, evaluating particular response strategies and the evaluation of laws and policies that impact IT decision making during emergencies. This paper uses the DVTISS tool to consider organizational responses to several example emergency situations. It demonstrates the utility of the tool as well as its efficacy for decision making support. Based on the example emergencies, the paper also discusses key areas of vulnerability during emergency situations and their financial, data and system outage impacts."
9316003,A review of various challenges in cybersecurity using Artificial Intelligence,"Cybersecurity using Artificial Intelligence is a double-edged sword, it can improve security substantially but it also creates a possibility of new forms of attack, which performed on Artificial Intelligence itself. Machine Learning algorithms are proved useful at identifying zero-day attacks or detecting an unusual behavior of systems that might indicate an attack or a malware. This research work has reviewed various security threats and defensive techniques, open challenges in cybersecurity domain for intrusion detection, malware detection and network anomaly detection systems using various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. It is found that most of the discussed approaches used supervised models. For intrusion detection, RBF-SVM (Radial Basis Function - Support Vector Machine) model gave highest accuracy of 99.90% while in malware detection DNN (Deep Neural Network) model gave 97.79% accuracy. For pirated software identification, a DNN model was used and it gave 96% accuracy. Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model worked best for network anomaly detection giving an accuracy of 99.90%. On the other hand, for anomaly detection a DBN (Deep Belief Networks) based model is used which gives 69.77% accuracy. Finally, this paper discusses about the 5G's security, cyber-attacks and the major role of the above emerging fields in the future of cybersecurity."

8474336,Cybersecurity Measures for Geocasting in Vehicular Cyber Physical System Environments,"Geocasting in vehicular communication has witnessed significant attention due to the benefits of location oriented information dissemination in vehicular traffic environments. Various measures have been applied to enhance geocasting performance including dynamic relay area selection, junction nodes incorporation, caching integration, and geospatial distribution of nodes. However, the literature lacks toward geocasting under malicious relay vehicles leading to cybersecurity concern in vehicular traffic environments. In this context, this paper presents cybersecurity measures for geocasting in vehicular traffic environments focusing on security oriented vehicular connectivity. Specifically, a vehicular intrusion prevention technique is developed to measure the connectivity between the cache agent (CA) and cache user (CU) vehicles. The connectivity between static transport vehicles and CA/CU is measured via vehicular intrusion detection approach. The performance of the proposed vehicular cybersecurity measure is evaluated in realistic traffic environments. The comparative performance evaluation attests the benefits of security oriented geocasting in vehicular traffic environments."
8932339,Cybersecurity in the Power Electronics,"Confidentiality, integrity and availability are essential features for devices connected to the Industrial Internet ofThings. However, cybersecurity was never a main concern for power electronics because most of the devices were designed to operate in an isolation mode, without connectivity and data transfer with other devices. With the digital transformation and the industry 4.0, there was a disruptive change in this scenario. Companies, governments and universities have been studying and developing mechanisms to mitigate vulnerabilities in these devices.

9312769,DGA-based botnet detection toward imbalanced multiclass learning,"Botnets based on the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) mechanism pose great challenges to the main current detection methods because of their strong concealment and robustness. However, the complexity of the DGA family and the imbalance of samples continue to impede research on DGA detection. In the existing work, the sample size of each DGA family is regarded as the most important determinant of the resampling proportion; thus, differences in the characteristics of various samples are ignored, and the optimal resampling effect is not achieved. In this paper, a Long Short-Term Memory-based Property and Quantity Dependent Optimization (LSTM.PQDO) method is proposed. This method takes advantage of LSTM to automatically mine the comprehensive features of DGA domain names. It iterates the resampling proportion with the optimal solution based on a comprehensive consideration of the original number and characteristics of the samples to heuristically search for a better solution around the initial solution in the right direction; thus, dynamic optimization of the resampling proportion is realized. The experimental results show that the LSTM.PQDO method can achieve better performance compared with existing models to overcome the difficulties of unbalanced datasets; moreover, it can function as a reference for sample resampling tasks in similar scenarios."

8901756,Better Word Representations with Word Weight,"As a fundamental task of natural language processing, text classification has been widely used in various applications such as sentiment analysis and spam detection. In recent years, the continuous-valued word embedding learned by neural network attaches extensive attentions. Although word embedding achieves impressive results in capturing similarities and regularities between words, it fails to highlight important words for identifying text category. Such deficiency could be attenuated by word weight, which conveys word contribution in text categorization. Toward this end, we propose an effective text classification scheme by incorporating word weight into word embedding in this paper. Specifically, in order to enrich word representation, the bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) is first employed to grasp context information of words. Then the word weights yielded by term frequency (TF) are used to modulate the word representation of Bi-GRU for constructing text representation. Extensive experimental results on several large text datasets verify that the accuracy of our proposed text classification scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art ones."
8600738,Enhancing Cloud-Based IoT Security Through Trustworthy Cloud Service: An Integration of Security and Reputation Approach,"The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a new paradigm for the development of heterogeneous and distributed systems, and it has increasingly become a ubiquitous computing service platform. However, due to the lack of sufficient computing and storage resources dedicated to the processing and storage of huge volumes of the IoT data, it tends to adopt a cloud-based architecture to address the issues of resource constraints. Hence, a series of challenging security and trust concerns have arisen in the cloud-based IoT context. To this end, a novel trust assessment framework for the security and reputation of cloud services is proposed. This framework enables the trust evaluation of cloud services in order to ensure the security of the cloud-based IoT context via integrating security- and reputation-based trust assessment methods. The security-based trust assessment method employs the cloud-specific security metrics to evaluate the security of a cloud service. Furthermore, the feedback ratings on the quality of cloud service are exploited in the reputation-based trust assessment method in order to evaluate the reputation of a cloud service. The experiments conducted using a synthesized dataset of security metrics and a real-world web service dataset show that our proposed trust assessment framework can efficiently and effectively assess the trustworthiness of a cloud service while outperforming other trust assessment methods."
8882327,Phantom Eavesdropping With Whitened RF Leakage,"Recent studies figure out that hidden eavesdroppers can be detected through RF (radio frequency) leakage from their local oscillators. Inspired by this finding, this letter presents Phantom Eavesdropping, an emerging wireless signal eavesdropping technique which renders hidden eavesdroppers immune to the RF leakage-based detection to further conceal their presence. At its heart is a dynamic alteration process regarding the local oscillator's oscillation frequency. As a result, the RF leakage from the local oscillator is whitened in the frequency domain and thus the corresponding eavesdropper becomes footprint-less. Practical experiment shows that Phantom Eavesdropping does not affect normal Wi-Fi eavesdropping while further rendering eavesdroppers transparent to eavesdropper detectors."

Three main vulnerabilities of the cipher are described: differential cryptanalysis, the presence of equivalent keys, and in most detail - the “related-key” attack. Next, we consider the algorithm for generating the DES round keys and its modification, which makes it possible to integrate this algorithm into the TEA."
9091122,Securing Instant Messages With Hardware-Based Cryptography and Authentication in Browser Extension,"Instant Messaging (IM) provides near-real-time communication between users, which has shown to be a valuable tool for internal communication in companies and for general-purpose interaction among people. IM systems and supporting protocols, however, must consider security aspects to guarantee the messages' authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity. In this paper, we present a solution for integrating hardware-based public key cryptography into Converse.js, an open-source IM client for browsers enabled with the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). The proposal is developed as a plugin for Converse.js, thus overriding the original functions of the client; and a browser extension that is triggered by the plugin and is responsible for calling the encryption and decryption services for each sent and received message. This integrated artifact allowed the experimental validation of the proposal providing authenticity of IM users with digital certificates and protection of IM messages with hardware-based cryptography. Results also shows the proposed systems is resistent to adversarial attacks against confidentiality and integrity and it is secure when considering cryptrographic tests like the Hamming distance and the NIST SP800-22."
8913779,Labeling malicious communication samples based on semi-supervised deep neural network,"The limited labeled sample data in the field of advanced security threats detection seriously restricts the effective development of research work. Learning the sample labels from the labeled and unlabeled data has received a lot of research attention and various universal labeling methods have been proposed. However, the labeling task of malicious communication samples targeted at advanced threats has to face the two practical challenges: the difficulty of extracting effective features in advance and the complexity of the actual sample types. To address these problems, we proposed a sample labeling method for malicious communication based on semi-supervised deep neural network. This method supports continuous learning and optimization feature representation while labeling sample, and can handle uncertain samples that are outside the concerned sample types. According to the experimental results, our proposed deep neural network can automatically learn effective feature representation, and the validity of features is close to or even higher than that of features which extracted based on expert knowledge. Furthermore, our proposed method can achieve the labeling accuracy of 97.64%~98.50%, which is more accurate than the train-then-detect, kNN and LPA methods in any labeled-sample proportion condition. The problem of insufficient labeled samples in many network attack detecting scenarios, and our proposed work can function as a reference for the sample labeling tasks in the similar real-world scenarios."
9096870,Developing of Algorithm of HTTP FLOOD DDoS Protection,"One of most relevant cyberattacks are DDoS-attacks, purpose of which is failure (denial) of service by server. Its successful implementation limits, or ensures the inaccessibility of information system resources located on server, to all its users. The consequences of this attack can result in financial losses for IS owner, as well as failure of hardware as a whole. Practical implementation of the method for detecting DDoS attacks at L7 level of OSI model - HTTP Flood if offered. This method is based on mathematical model that reproduces the interaction of clients with the server. It takes into account the individual characteristics of parameters describing operation of network and server, which affects to the possibility of more effective attack detection.

Such solution realization is aimed to protect critical resources of commercial organizations and natural persons to provide service from DDos-type attacks."
9576203,A Toolkit for Building More Adaptable User Interfaces for Vision-Impaired Users,"Most prior research into adaptable and adaptive user interfaces primarily focuses on facilitating consistent user experiences across devices and pays less attention to facilitating universal access for diverse end users. We address this shortcoming by developing adaptable user interface components for a category of diverse users, the vision impaired. This paper presents a framework that supports run time adaptation of web components to suit vision impaired users by using a set of adaptable, reusable widgets. We developed a prototype using these components and evaluated its effectiveness. Our results show that an such an adaptable user interface provides significant benefit in many key W3C accessibility areas, helping to make the web more accessible for diverse end users."
9491099,Detecting Hardware Trojans using Combined Self Testing and Imaging,"Hardware Trojans are malicious modifications in integrated circuits (ICs) with an intent to breach security and compromise the reliability of an electronic system. This paper proposes a framework using self-testing, advanced imaging, and image processing with machine learning to detect hardware Trojans inserted by untrusted foundries. It includes on-chip test structures with negligible power, delay, and silicon area overheads. The core step of the framework is on-chip golden circuit design, which can provide authentic samples for image-based Trojan detection through self-testing. This core step enables a golden-chip-free Trojan detection that does not rely on an existing image data set from Trojan free chip or image synthesizing. We have conducted an in-depth analysis of detection steps and discussed possible attacks with countermeasures to strengthen this framework. The performance evaluation on a 28nm FPGA and a 90nm IC validates its high accuracy and reliability for practical applications."

9096741,Controlling the Resources of the Intrusion Detection System at Network Objects Monitoring,The article is devoted to the optimization of intrusion detection system resources when monitoring a set of network objects. The application of the approach proposed in the article makes it possible to optimally distribute the computing resources of an information system between several objects of a network infrastructure based on the available a priori information about these objects. The scientific novelty lies in the fact that the proposed approach allows us to adapt the mathematical apparatus of the theory of observation control to the tasks of providing information protection for communication networks.
8949029,Automated Threat-Alert Screening for Battling Alert Fatigue with Temporal Isolation Forest,"Network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDSes) tend to output massive alert logs to cover all suspicious communications that deviate from normal network traffic. Due to the tremendous volume of these alert logs, real-time incident response or keeping in pace with the alerts sometimes turns out to be impractical for security operators who have to genuinely investigate each alert to verify whether immediate remedial action is necessary. This problem, known as the threat-alert fatigue problem, causes many unexplored alerts and hence deteriorates the quality of service (QoS). In order to reduce the massive number of alerts, we propose an alert screening scheme that can triage alerts on the basis of the potential of a vast threat. We leverage the fully unsupervised nature of the adopted isolation forest method. Our proposed scheme does not require any prior labeling information and is thus suitable for most NIDSes deployed in enterprise environments. Moreover, by taking advantage of the temporal information in the alerts, we observe that each period (currently set to one day) has its distinct characteristics, which can be exploited to isolate anomalies. This study demonstrates the advantages of unsupervised learning in reducing vast threat alerts and lays the groundwork for battling the alert fatigue problem."

Finally, use the training data set to train the neural network, using the test data set to test the accuracy of this neural network structure, the results show that this method has a greater improvement in training speed and accuracy than other neural networks."
9529653,"Improving Human-Centric Software Defect Evaluation, Reporting, and Fixing","Defect reporting customarily exists in most applications and web sites to support issue reporting by end users and for developers to receive actionable feedback. However, the impact of ""human-centric"" issues - such as age, gender, language, culture, physical and mental challenges, and socio-economic status - is often overlooked in the development process and during product inception and defect reporting. Most defect reporting tools lack necessary human-centric features to enable a challenged user to adequately navigate and report defects i.e. do not take into account the human differences between end users that cause defects for them in their software and make reporting of such defects difficult for them. Most defect reporting tools also lack sufficient defect report structuring, reporting guidance, and do not emphasize the possible perceived severity of the defect to developers from end users who are very different to them. If users are unable to report defects due to usability issues, this makes those same defect reports difficult to understand by the developer. In this paper, we aim to improve human-centric defect reporting by employing cognitive walkthrough with diverse end user personas, develop a prototype of an improved defect reporting tool, and evaluate the prototype’s defect reporting process from end user and developer perspectives. Our findings offer a foundation for improved human-centric defect evaluation, reporting and fixing."
9317525,Easy Data Augmentation Method for Classification Tasks,"In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning has made great progress in artificial intelligence-related technologies. With the deepening of artificial intelligence research, machine learning is applied to more and more fields. Although machine learning has many advantages and has achieved considerable results, machine learning and its related learning algorithms still face some related challenges. That is, the lack of sufficient training data or uneven class balance in the data set. In deep artificial neural networks, a large amount of training data is needed to learn effectively, and collecting such training data is often expensive and laborious. Data Augmentation overcomes this problem by artificially expanding the training set and label retention conversion. In this article, we propose a method to expand the data set based on ball k-means. The experiments on the Four-class, Digits, Iris and Breast-cancer data sets prove the efficiency of the method-fast execution speed, low computational complexity, and the effectiveness of the method. In these experiments, the quality of the training model has been improved, but the learning time stays the same as when the enhancement method is unused."
9317354,Researching on Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem based On Composite Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm,"In the practice, the essence of most scheduling problem belongs to flexible Job-Shop Scheduling problem, denoted as FJSP. As a consequence, researching for flexible job-shop scheduling has become hot spot in academy. It is difficult to directly apply traditional scheduling problems to solve FJSP because of complexity of FJSP. So, in this paper, based on grasshopper optimization algorithm, a novel algorithm is proposed and denoted as CGOA. CGOA firstly applies technology of chaotic sequence to initialize grasshopper population. And then CGOA utilizes the technology of quasi opposition-based learning, splitting strategy and Cauchy mutation to balance the ability of global search and local search. In the end, two public datasets are applied to verify the efficiency of CGOA. The result show that the efficiency of CGOA is better than traditional scheduling algorithms."
8970885,Using Text Annotation Tool on Cyber Security News — A Review,"Cyber-attack has become one of the main concern in our everyday life and being reported throughout online news website. As thousands of news article existed, it is difficult to go through all the news which lead to a slower analyzing process. Hence, a vital text mining component known as Information Extraction (IE) is needed in order to ease the knowledge discovery process for the wide collection of the cyber security news. To make IE process better and easier, the usage of tool such as General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) can help a lot especially in creating annotated corpus. In this paper, we will introduce and reviewing several annotation tools that are freely available and also to discuss steps needed to create an annotated corpus for the cyber security text documents."

9319022,Invisible Security: Protecting Users with No Time to Spare,"For over 50 years, the cybersecurity community has sought to protect vulnerable systems and users from victimization. Despite ongoing and valiant work at adoption and usability, some users cannot or will not avail themselves of necessary cybersecurity measures such as patching. Average, non-expert users-particularly those in small businesses-cannot afford to devote time to cybersecurity. Instead of accepting the risk of no security, alternatives are possible which achieve both security outcomes and conservation of time. We explore the paradigm of invisible security focused on creating cyber defenses that occur automatically without end user intervention. Invisible security is the next evolutionary step to aid users, now that automation is robust and effective in supporting it. Even though some example implementations, such as automatic updates, have existed for years, dedicated focus on this emerging paradigm is required to develop, measure, and deploy new capabilities. We present examples consistent with this approach in existence today, including automatic software updates and protective DNS. We draw insight and comparisons to other domains, including automobile safety. Then we describe how invisible defenses may aid potential beneficiaries in health care, the defense industrial base, and the general public. Finally, we present benefits and limitations of the approach and propose areas of future research and innovation."

Malware variants among the same malware family shared similar behavioural patterns or signatures reflecting their purpose. We propose an approach that combines support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and active learning by learning (ALBL) techniques to deal with insufficient labeled data in terms of the malware classification tasks. The proposed approach is evaluated with the malware family dataset from Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015) on Kaggle. The results show that ALBL techniques can effectively boost the performance of our machine learning models and improve the quality of labeled samples."
9230074,Cybersecurity Deception Experimentation System,"Cybersecurity deception research has had many successes in recent years. While early cyber deception systems (e.g., honeypots) were largely static, recent approaches leverage computational game theory and machine learning techniques to allow for dynamic deception strategies that can potentially observe, react, and adapt to an adversary in both the short and long term. However, applying these theoretical models and algorithms in real-world settings poses additional considerations that are not always apparent in theory. Currently, testbeds and experimentation platforms for dynamic deception are lacking, limiting the ability of researchers and analysts to test and evaluate these approaches using realistic scenarios and data. Honeypots are a technology where these dynamic deception methods can have a great impact on effectiveness. The basic technology to mimic nodes and network services has been used for several decades and is effective against less experienced adversaries, but is less useful against sophisticated intruders. Using adaptation, behavior-based model development and reasoning and other artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to make honeypots much more effective against experienced adversaries by making them less predictable and more targeted. Before these novel technologies can be used in the real world, it is critical that they are tested and validated on realistic systems and in realistic settings. We present the Cybersecurity Deception Experimentation System (CDES) that extends the Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) to provide a platform that is capable of evaluating dynamic deception algorithms. We also provide three case studies that demonstrate how CDES can be used to practically implement dynamic honeypots in increasingly complex scenarios and discuss some nuances of each implementation."

In the early 1960s, people saw the great potential of transmitting and sharing information across different systems, with a focus on the scientific and military fields. The theory of packet switching, which forms the basis of the modern-day internet, emerged after MIT's J. C. R. Licklider proposed the first global network of computers in 1962. Along with early technological innovations came the need to secure sensitive data, software, and applications, giving birth to cybersecurity. Further underscoring the importance of cybersecurity is the explosion of internet (or World Wide Web [WWW]) users, who jumped from one billion in 2005 to more than four billion in 2019. 1 And that's only 53 percent of the world's (still growing) population!"

A contextual approach on the ethics of small digital organizations in France,"With the proliferation of malware and phishing attacks, information security has become a major challenge for companies. Organizations of all sizes have had to develop efficient cybersecurity strategies. Part of the literature has explained the growing cyber risks by the human factor such as the mistakes of users. Our aim is to analyze the user’s cybersecurity ethics in their working context. We used the Feenberg’s concepts of technical codes’ potentialities to critically interpret the technical codes of users. We found three technical codes representing a variety of dimensions and combined a diversity of point of view about cybersecurity ethics: interest, values and priorities. These technical codes allow us to uncover alternative representations of user’s ethics and to think critically on the way researchers, practitioners and information security specialists view and imagine the future of information security among small organizations. Our empirical findings are based on a critical qualitative research among small organizations with similar cybersecurity systems in France."

The certification of cybersecurity MOOCs could help promote quality aspects of MOOCs and enable their quality assessment and comparison. We conducted an online survey to analyse the role of cybersecurity MOOC certification based on proposed quality criteria for cybersecurity MOOCs and for MOOCs in general. Participants reported mixed experiences with MOOCs and largely agreed with our proposed quality criteria. This paper shows that there is a high acceptance and need for certification."

8923077,Automotive Cybersecurity: Foundations for Next-Generation Vehicles,"The automotive industry is experiencing a serious transformation due to a digitalisation process and the transition to the new paradigm of Mobility-as-a-Service. The next-generation vehicles are going to be very complex cyber-physical systems, whose design must be reinvented to fulfil the increasing demand of smart services, both for safety and entertainment purposes, causing the manufacturers' model to converge towards that of IT companies. Connected cars and autonomous driving are the preeminent factors that drive along this route, and they cause the necessity of a new design to address the emerging cybersecurity issues: the “old” automotive architecture relied on a single closed network, with no external communications; modern vehicles are going to be always connected indeed, which means the attack surface will be much more extended. The result is the need for a paradigm shift towards a secure-by-design approach. In this paper, we propose a systematisation of knowledge about the core cybersecurity aspects to consider when designing a modern car. The major focus is pointed on the in-vehicle network, including its requirements, the current most used protocols and their vulnerabilities. Moreover, starting from the attackers' goals and strategies, we outline the proposed solutions and the main projects towards secure architectures. In this way, we aim to provide the foundations for more targeted analyses about the security impact of autonomous driving and connected cars."
9006122,Intelligent Feature Engineering for Cybersecurity,"Feature engineering and selection is a critical step in the implementation of any machine learning system. In application areas such as intrusion detection for cybersecurity, this task is made more complicated by the diverse data types and ranges presented in both raw data packets and derived data fields. Additionally, the time and context specific nature of the data requires domain expertise to properly engineer the features while minimizing any potential information loss. Many previous efforts in this area naively apply techniques for feature engineering that are successful in image recognition applications. In this work, we use network packet dataflows from the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) and the Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC) high performance computing systems to experimentally analyze various methods of feature engineering.

9319051,"Malicious Design in AIVR, Falsehood and Cybersecurity-oriented Immersive Defenses","Advancements in the AI field unfold tremendous opportunities for society. Simultaneously, it becomes increasingly important to address emerging ramifications. Thereby, the focus is often set on ethical and safe design forestalling unintentional failures. However, cybersecurity-oriented approaches to AI safety additionally consider instantiations of intentional malice - including unethical malevolent AI design. Recently, an analogous emphasis on malicious actors has been expressed regarding security and safety for virtual reality (VR). In this vein, while the intersection of AI and VR (AIVR) offers a wide array of beneficial cross-fertilization possibilities, it is responsible to anticipate future malicious AIVR design from the onset on given the potential socio-psycho-technological impacts. For a simplified illustration, this paper analyzes the conceivable use case of Generative AI (here deepfake techniques) utilized for disinformation in immersive journalism. In our view, defenses against such future AIVR safety risks related to falsehood in immersive settings should be transdisciplinarily conceived from an immersive co-creation stance. As a first step, we motivate a cybersecurity-oriented procedure to generate defenses via immersive design fictions. Overall, there may be no panacea but updatable transdisciplinary tools including AIVR itself could be used to incrementally defend against malicious actors in AIVR."

These industries include insurance, health, e-commerce, learning institutions, conducting and coordinating military airstrikes, and performing weather monitoring, among other crucial functionalities. The increased use and adoption of drones has resulted in the Internet of Drones. As more industries continue to adopt drone usage, the issue of securing them arises. The need for organizations to ensure and coordinate thousands of drones has necessitated the adoption of a security mechanism that guarantees the security of these devices. We explore the use of Blockchain technology as a means of enhancing drone cybersecurity. We research how industrial players perceive Blockchain and its contribution to cybersecurity."
8858471,Cybersecurity in SMEs: The Smart-Home/Office Use Case,"Today, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) can be considered as the new big target for cyber attacks, while the cybercrime prevention is often neglected within their environment. This paper aims to investigate the characteristics of cybersecurity threats in the Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) ecosystem of a Smart-Home/Office environment being constituted by SMEs that contains various smart-devices and IoT equipment, smart-grid components, employees' workstations and medium sized networking equipment. As the Cyber-security in such an ecosystem is greatly demanding and challenging because of the various communication layers and the different supported IoT devices, we introduce a more robust, resilient and effective cybersecurity solution that can be effortlessly tailored to each individual enterprise's evolving needs and can also speedily adapt/respond to the changing cyber threat landscape. Thus, this Cyber-security framework will be evaluated through three major types of Smart-Home/Office datasets and will be supported from SME/ICT clusters under the framework of the Secure and Private Smart Grid (SPEAR) H2020 project. The first promising results of our work indicate the potential of implementing strong defence mechanisms for SMEs' environments within DIHs."
9297323,AI and machine learning: A mixed blessing for cybersecurity,"While the usage of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Software (AI/MLS) in defensive cybersecurity has received considerable attention, there remains a noticeable research gap on their offensive use. This paper reviews the defensive usage of AI/MLS in cybersecurity and then presents a survey of its offensive use. Inspired by the System-Fault-Risk (SFR) framework, we categorize AI/MLS-powered cyberattacks by their actions into seven categories. We cover a wide spectrum of attack vectors, discuss their practical implications and provide some recommendations for future research."
9441313,Cybersecurity Challenges during Pandemic in Smart Cities,"This paper focuses on the Cybersecurity challenges faced by smart cities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the pandemic still there, cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups have taken advantage of attacking intelligent cities worldwide. This research primarily focuses on a correspondence between the increase in the attacks on different cyber-sectors in smart cities and the ongoing pandemic. When people are still adjusting to the new norm of working from home (WFH) and online classes, there had been many cases of cyber criminals trying to taking over some popular video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, and Google meet. Hijacking the sessions and displaying their agenda or demands are among the attacks which Cybercriminals have mounted on these platforms. There is a genuine concern regarding the cybersecurity of smart cities with the rise of cyber threats during the Corona virus pandemic. This paper studies the increase of cyber threats and issues on smart cities globally in the ongoing pandemic and different ways to confront them using technologies like Blockchain, Internet of Things, Software-defined networks, Artificial Intelligence, and data-driven security concepts."
9141991,A Cybersecurity Model for Decision-Making Problems Under Uncertainty Using Game Theory,"We propose a new cybersecurity decision-making model based on game-theory and decision-making process. The proposed model allows the cyber defender to make optimal decisions by considering perceived damage, cost of potential defensive actions, and benefit to mission. We provide detailed examples and numerical results supporting our model to show how game theory can help the decision-making process for cybersecurity by focusing on situations of conflict between an attacker and a defender."
9491123,Cybersecurity in Smart City: A Systematic Mapping Study,"The idea and philosophy of smart cities were launched specifically to take advantage of the qualitative technological capabilities to overcome the obstacles and problems associated with the huge urban development and the boom that humanity is experiencing in recent years, especially sustainability, congestion, transportation, and various energy uses. In addition, these smart cities seek to improve the level of living and provide life services in a modern form, such as health care, enjoying a more integrated transportation service, reducing environmental pollution and other services.

8883535,An Analysis of Assessment Approaches and Maturity Scales used for Evaluation of Information Security and Cybersecurity User Awareness and Training Programs: A Scoping Review,"This study aimed to ascertain the types of approaches that are applied in the assessments of information security and cybersecurity user awareness and training programs. The study focused on achieving two objectives. The first objective focused on to find out what measurements are used in the assessment of the effectiveness of information security and cybersecurity user awareness and training programs. The second objective focused on studies that made use of maturity models to measure the progress of these programs. A Scoping Literature Review process was followed to achieve these objectives. The study found that there is a gap in current literature with regards to the assessment of these programs, as only five papers and two maturity models focused on the assessment of these programs. The study further recommends that more studies be conducted in the assessment of these programs, as most researchers are encouraging the use of the programs in the fight against cyber-attacks."
9548370,Influence of Organizational Factors and Forms of Accounting Outsourcing on Enterprise Cybersecurity,"Advances in computer communications and shift to a digital economy necessitate the outsourcing of accounting operations, that is delegation of accounting functions to third parties. It is proved that introduction of accounting outsourcing leads to emergence of significant cyber risks to the operation of the economic entity. It is substantiated that when choosing an optimal form of outsourcing, enterprise management should be focused on the organizational features of accounting foremost. The influence of organizational accounting factors on the cybersecurity of the enterprise in the context of outsourcing and its various forms is determined. The methodology for assessing potential cyber risks of accounting outsourcing is developed in terms of delegating accounting functions to a specialized outsourcing firm, an independent accounting expert, an embedded accountant-outstaffer, or a cloud information processing service. The proposals can be used beneficially during the selection of organizational forms of outsourcing in order to ensure enterprise cybersecurity."

In particular, it becomes a key element in the context of cybersecurity, as our case is. Therefore, this paper analyses a gambling experience in a cybersecurity subject within a Computer Engineering degree, in order to assess whether the spaced learning methodology contributes to the improvement of learning. The gamification experience is carried out through a Flag Capture Competition (CTF) among the enrolled students in the course. The use of the platform has also been evaluated in an exploratory way."
9433709,Wireless Cybersecurity Education: A Focus on Curriculum,"Higher education is increasingly called upon to enhance cyber education, including hands-on ""experiential"" training. The good news is that additional tools and techniques are becoming more available, both in-house and through third parties, to provide cyber training environments and simulations at various features and price points. However, the training thus far has only focused on ""traditional"" Cybersecurity that lightly touches on wireless in undergraduate and master's degree programs, and certifications. The purpose of this research is to identify and recognize nascent cyber training emphasizing a broader spectrum of wireless security and encourage curricular development that includes critical experiential training. Experiential wireless security training is important to keep pace with the growth in wireless communication mediums and associated Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical System (CPS) applications.

Our visual representation of IoT systems aims to facilitate the identification of the IoT attack surface and the vulnerabilities that an attacker may exploit. The paper first outlines the basic visual elements and the associated grammar, which are then applied to a series of smart home IoT use cases to demonstrate how these can be used to represent these networks and their cybersecurity requirements in a visual and intuitive way. The motivation behind this work is to improve our ability to reason about IoT attack surfaces towards improving our defense capabilities for those systems."
9281544,Exploration of Smart Grid Device Cybersecurity Vulnerability Using Shodan,"The generation, transmission, distribution, and storage of electric power is becoming increasingly decentralized. Advances in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are rapidly changing the nature of the power grid. Moreover, the accommodation of these new technologies by the legacy grid requires that an increasing number of devices be Internet connected so as to allow for sensor and actuator information to be collected, transmitted, and processed. With the wide adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of smart grid devices that can potentially affect the stability, reliability, and resilience of the power grid need to be carefully examined and addressed. This is especially true in situations in which smart grid devices are deployed with default configurations or without reasonable protections against malicious activities. While much work has been done to characterize the vulnerabilities associated with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Industrial Control System (ICS) devices, this paper demonstrates that similar vulnerabilities associated with the newer class of IoT smart grid devices are becoming a concern. Specifically, this paper first performs an evaluation of such devices using the Shodan platform and text processing techniques to analyze a potential vulnerability involving the lack of password protection. This work further explores several Shodan search terms that can be used to identify additional smart grid components that can be evaluated in terms of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Finally, this paper presents recommendations for the more secure deployment of such smart grid devices."
9152956,Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity: A Systematic Mapping of Literature,"Due to the ever-increasing complexities in cybercrimes, there is the need for cybersecurity methods to be more robust and intelligent. This will make defense mechanisms to be capable of making real-time decisions that can effectively respond to sophisticated attacks. To support this, both researchers and practitioners need to be familiar with current methods of ensuring cybersecurity (CyberSec). In particular, the use of artificial intelligence for combating cybercrimes. However, there is lack of summaries on artificial intelligent methods for combating cybercrimes. To address this knowledge gap, this study sampled 131 articles from two main scholarly databases (ACM digital library and IEEE Xplore). Using a systematic mapping, the articles were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. It was observed that artificial intelligent methods have made remarkable contributions to combating cybercrimes with significant improvement in intrusion detection systems. It was also observed that there is a reduction in computational complexity, model training times and false alarms. However, there is a significant skewness within the domain. Most studies have focused on intrusion detection and prevention systems, and the most dominant technique used was support vector machines. The findings also revealed that majority of the studies were published in two journal outlets. It is therefore suggested that to enhance research in artificial intelligence for CyberSec, researchers need to adopt newer techniques and also publish in other related outlets."
9396958,Cybersecurity Challenges and Policy Options for Bangladesh,"Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting information on the internet and intranet from outside sources. The age-old traditional information security systems have been rendered ineffective owing to fast moving digital transformation. The current perceptions suggest that information insecurity environment in cyberspace across the globe is increasing at unprecedented pace at both global and national context. The Bangladesh situation has been analyzed in this paper through four internationally recognized indices. It indicates the requirement of significant rooms for improvements. Such phenomenon is impacting persons, organizations, and states. The challenges of cybersecurity emanate from lack of legal frameworks or improper legal documents, inefficient technical institutions, lack of organizational ability and capacity building, and finally lack of cooperation mechanisms. The suggested policy options have addressed the ongoing challenges with a view to developing a digitally connected safe, secure, and reliable Bangladesh by 2030."
9141261,Prosumer Nanogrids: A Cybersecurity Assessment,"Nanogrids are customer deployments that can generate and inject electricity into the power grid. These deployments are based on behind-the-meter renewable energy resources and are labeled as “prosumer setups”, allowing customers to not only consume electricity, but also produce it. A residential nanogrid is comprised of a physical layer that is a household-scale electric power system, and a cyber layer that is used by manufacturers and/or grid operators to remotely monitor and control the nanogrid. With the increased penetration of renewable energy resources, nanogrids are at the forefront of a paradigm shift in the operational landscape and their correct operation is vital to the electric power grid. In this paper, we perform a cybersecurity assessment of a state-of-the art residential nanogrid deployment. For this purpose, we deployed a real-world experimental nanogrid setup that is based on photovoltaic (PV) generation. We analyzed the security and the resiliency of this system at both the cyber and physical layers. While we noticed improvements in the cybersecurity measures employed in the current nanogrid compared to previous generations, there are still major concerns. Our experiments show that these concerns range from exploiting well-known protocols, such as Secure Shell (SSH) and Domain Name Service (DNS), to the leakage of confidential information, and major shortcomings in the software updating mechanism. While the compromise of multiple nanogrids can have a negative effect on the entire power grid, we focus our analysis on individual households and have determined through Simulink-based simulations the economic loss of a compromised deployment."

8779855,Blockchain’s Future Role in Cybersecurity. Analysis of Defensive and Offensive Potential Leveraging Blockchain-Based Platforms,"Blockchain and cybersecurity are two current themes in Information Technology that have evolved and gained tremendous attention over the past few years. In this paper authors aim to structure existing and potential use of blockchain-based cybersecurity solutions from the perspective of attackers and defenders to assess whether the intersection will tip the scales in favor of one of these groups. Historically blockchain has been mainly associated with innovative financial services (including crypto-currencies) but it has other emerging use cases within e-government, supply chain management as well as security (e.g. encryption, identity and authentication, data security). On the other hand, blockchain-based platforms are increasingly a target of malicious actors and could be used as an initial attack vector. Therefore, there is a case to be made weather further adoption of blockchain-based solutions should be encouraged or not from a security standpoint and if the overall potential for change could be net positive."
9282324,Review: Deep Learning Methods for Cybersecurity and Intrusion Detection Systems,"As the number of cyber-attacks is increasing, cyber-security is evolving to a key concern for any business. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) (in particular Deep Learning - DL) can be leveraged as key enabling technologies for cyber-defense, since they can contribute in threat detection and can even provide recommended actions to cyber analysts. A partnership of industry, academia, and government on a global scale is necessary in order to advance the adoption of AI/ML to cybersecurity and create efficient cyber defense systems. In this paper, we are concerned with the investigation of the various deep learning techniques employed for network intrusion detection and we introduce a DL framework for cybersecurity applications."
8882112,An experiential learning cybersecurity project for multiple STEM undergraduates,"The human element is often regarded as the weakest link in cybersecurity, yet education efforts focus primarily on the technical aspects of cybersecurity and downplay the relevance of the human factor. One way to exploit this human vulnerability is through social engineering, in which cybercriminals utilize persuasion and manipulation to get targets to reveal private information. This paper shares an educator's efforts to engage undergraduate students from multiple STEM disciplines in a hands-on social engineering project across the Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 semesters. This activity was designed using the experiential learning framework that promotes “learning by doing.” The authors share the experiences and challenges of both the students and the educator in conducting this learning exercise. In addition, this paper details aspects of designing multidisciplinary hands-on projects that consider meeting university ethics standards; generating relevant project instructions and rubrics; engaging in and promoting cross-disciplinary STEM dialog; and evaluating student engagement and learning."
9213712,Cybersecurity and Data Privacy in the Cloudlet for Preliminary Healthcare Big Data Analytics,"In cyber physical systems, cybersecurity and data privacy are among most critical considerations when dealing with communications, processing, and storage of data. Geospatial data and medical data are examples of big data that require seamless integration with computational algorithms as outlined in Industry 4.0 towards adoption of fourth industrial revolution. Healthcare Industry 4.0 is an application of the design principles of Industry 4.0 to the medical domain. Mobile applications are now widely used to accomplish important business functions in almost all industries. These mobile devices, however, are resource poor and proved insufficient for many important medical applications. Resource rich cloud services are used to augment poor mobile device resources for data and compute intensive applications in the mobile cloud computing paradigm. However, the performance of cloud services is undesirable for data-intensive, latency-sensitive mobile applications due increased hop count between the mobile device and the cloud server. Cloudlets are virtual machines hosted in server placed nearby the mobile device and offer an attractive alternative to the mobile cloud computing in the form of mobile edge computing. This paper outlines cybersecurity and data privacy aspects for communications of measured patient data from wearable wireless biosensors to nearby cloudlet host server in order to facilitate the cloudlet based preliminary and essential complex analytics for the medical big data."
9092393,A p2p environment to validate ensemble-based approaches in the cybersecurity domain,"The main data-driven techniques for detecting cybersecurity attacks are based on the analysis of network traffic data and/or of application/system logs (stored in a host or in some other kind of device). A wide range of machine-learning techniques (and possible alternative configurations of them) have been proposed in the literature so far, for this purpose, but none of them has been proven to consistently overcome the others across different datasets. In order to ensure better accuracy and stability, the ensemble paradigm can be exploited as an effective solution for combining such techniques. However, as attack detection problems are hard to cope with and, usually, entail the analysis of large and fast streams of data, different types of ensemble (and of base algorithms composing the ensemble) should have experimented, exploiting distributed architecture to suitably reduce the high-execution times necessary to run them. In order to handle all these issues, a p2p environment to validate ensemble-based approaches in the cybersecurity domain is proposed in this paper. Two case studies are analyzed by using this framework, which concern the detection of intrusions in network-traffic data and of deviant process instances. Preliminary scalability results demonstrate that the framework is a viable solution for these challenging kind of problems."
9271307,Ensuring Cybersecurity of Data Transmission in Limited Energy Consumption Networks,"In the northern gas fields, most data are transmitted via wireless networks, which requires special transmission security measures. Herewith, the gas field infrastructure dictates cybersecurity modules to not only meet standard requirements but also ensure reduced energy consumption. The paper discusses the issue of building such a module for a process control system based on the RTP-04M recorder operating in conjunction with an Android-based mobile device. The software options used for the RSA and Diffie-Hellman data encryption and decryption algorithms on both the RTP-04M and the Android-based mobile device sides in the Keil μVision4 and Android Studio software environments, respectively, have shown that the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is preferable. It provides significant savings in RAM and CPU resources and power consumption of the recorder. In terms of energy efficiency, the implemented programs have been analyzed in the Android Studio (Android Profiler) and Simplicity Studio (Advanced Energy Monitor) environments. The integration of this module into the existing software will improve the field's PCS cybersecurity level due to protecting data transmitted from third-party attacks."
9615321,A Literature Review of Machine Learning Techniques for Cybersecurity in Data Centers,"Currently, information and communication technologies (ICT) are an essential part of almost any business sector and, therefore, are the target of different cyberattacks. ICT security measures are necessary to protect information from unauthorized access. These measures include network monitoring, threat detection, and prevention. Machine learning is an important part of cybersecurity solutions that allows us to automatically analyze data patterns and learn from them to prevent similar attacks or to predict possible threats. This paper provides a literature review that summarizes different machine learning techniques and feature sets used in cybersecurity for an ICT system security analysis."
8961051,Cybersecurity through Inoculation,"In today's world, cyber-attacks are at the forefront of nearly every major economic and military power. Like a disease, some software viruses invade vulnerable Information Technology (IT) systems without warning and quickly spread from machine to machine at lightning speed. In some instances, the cyber-attack can severely disrupt the operations or even damage the integrity of an organization or agency. As humans, we have learned to control plagues and outbreaks at the source though various means and methods of isolation and inoculation. Why then should we not tackle cybersecurity vulnerabilities at the source and not simply react at the onset of an attack? Over the years, commercial industries have adopted and implemented ISO standards aimed at increasing quality and reliability of their products. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has established Qualified Product/Supplier/Manufacturers/Distributors Lists (QPL, QML, QSLM, QSLD) as a means to control and eliminate the likelihood of counterfeit parts from penetrating DoD supply chains. It is time for similar standards and techniques to be established and implemented for cybersecurity."
9223152,Cybersecurity Perspectives for Smart Building Automation Systems,"As the built environment becomes the hallmark of urbanisation tendencies worldwide, people have come to rely on buildings for a large majority of their daily activities. Modern buildings are equipped with new sensor technologies and advanced controllers, integrated through communication interfaces and application software to handle various required functions through automation. This is partially extended to legacy buildings through retrofitting. Integration of these new technologies opens up the automation system of the building to internal and external attackers. The challenges related to cybersecurity identified are partially similar to the industrial control system domain while adding specific constraints for the built environment as compared to a production/manufacturing environment, which relate to human safety, security and privacy aspects. We provide a critical overview of cybersecurity challenges for smart building automation systems by focusing on key areas of development at the device, system and communication and interoperability levels. A representative example for BACnet protocol features and tools is provided."
9346494,A Deep Neural Network Approach to Tracing Paths in Cybersecurity Investigations,Security Analysts (SAs) operating within Security Operation Centers (SOCs) conduct cybersecurity investigations on cyber events using methods which pave a measurable path. These paths serve as a source of evidence to study the transitions of the cognitive tasks performed by the SA throughout the investigation. Insight into these paths can support the observation and understanding of how to evaluate and measure the critical decisions made during an investigation such as when a SA transitions from analyzing event logs to observing threat intelligence. We propose a framework we call the Cyber Analysis Transition Framework which applies a quantitative approach for evaluating and measuring the transitions of the SA conducting cyber analysis methods. The novel approach for this framework includes the application of process mining and deep neural network output as a means for evaluating and measuring a SA's performance while conducting cybersecurity investigations.
8875930,Requirement Analysis for Cybersecurity Solutions in Industry 4.0 Platforms,"Increasing technology and the use of the Internet have brought the Industry 4.0 revolution.

The main components of the industry 4.0 such as cyber-physical system, the Internet of objects, big data and cloud computing has some of the challenges. One of these is cybersecurity. In this study, the structure of the technologies in industry 4.0 and cybersecurity requirement analyzes of these technologies were discussed. With the given recommendations, it is expected to use these technologies in Industry 4.0 safely. Finally, the necessary measures against cyber-attacks and risks in developing technologies and the use of security systems were discussed."
9283823,A Non-Cooperative Game based Model for the Cybersecurity of Autonomous Systems,"Autonomous systems (AS) would soon revolutionize the way we live and work. The days are not so far when these systems, from delivery drones to driverless cars, would be seen around us. These systems are connected and rely heavily on the communication network for the information exchange, hence prone to several attacks. Human lives will be at risk if these systems are compromised. Cybersecurity modeling and attack analysis of AS needs the utmost attention of the research community. Primarily, a typical AS has three modules - perception, cognition, and control - and each one of them comes with their own vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose a new AS architecture that may prove useful in AS cybersecurity modeling. We also model the attacks on them, and defense mechanisms applied to these modules using a non-cooperative non-zero sum game. Finally, we solve this game to obtain optimal strategies to maintain a secure system state."
8962288,A Social Economic Analysis of the Impact of GDPR on Security and Privacy Practices,"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have been presented by many policymakers as fundamental, welfare enhancing policies. While individuals value privacy, these policies require significant up front and ongoing investment by firms. For example, an analysis commissioned by the California Department of Justice's Office of the Attorney General estimates 14:1 cost to benefit ratio. No such analysis could be found from EU authorities for the GDPR. Sweeping regulatory regimes can create unintended consequences. This paper offers a brief introduction to the new cybersecurity challenges created by the GDPR and CCPA within firms and in the larger Internet ecosystem. As a result of the regulation, firms face many challenges to comply with costly and complex rules, broad definitions of personally identifiable information (PII), and increased risk of fee and/or lawsuit for violations, vulnerabilities, and lack of compliance. Since the promulgation of the GDPR, important security side effects have reported including the blocking of public information in the WHOIS internet protocol database, identity theft through the hacking of the Right to Access provision (Article 15) and other provisions, and the proliferation of network equipment with security and privacy vulnerabilities. The paper also offers a brief overview of the Gordon-Loeb (GL) model used for calculating the optimal investment in cybersecurity. [1] A preliminary data set is offered to examine the difficulty of estimating the cost of cybersecurity investment in light of the GDPR. Notably, the value of the European Union's data economy was estimated to be €300 billion in 2016 [2]. The given GL model would suggest that the optimal investment to protect data would be €13.2 billion. The actual European cyber spend was some €15 billion in 2015, [3] a slightly higher number which covers the EU plus additional European countries, suggesting that the GL model some applicab...

8904783,Security Patterns for Automotive Systems,"As automotive systems become increasingly sophisticated with numerous onboard features that support extensive inward and outward facing communication, cybersecurity vulnerabilities are exposed. The relatively recent acknowledgement of automotive cybersecurity challenges has prompted numerous research efforts into developing techniques to handle individual threat vectors, the pathways and threat surfaces by which an attack can be realized. Security design patterns have been developed for many application domains (e.g., enterprise systems, networking systems, and distributed systems), but not much has been explored for automotive systems. This paper introduces a collection of security design patterns targeted for automotive cybersecurity needs. We leverage and extend the de facto standard template used to describe design patterns to include fields specific to the automotive domain and SAE J3061 cybersecurity development guidelines."
9245414,Using FireEye Endpoint Security for educational purposes,"In this paper, it is presented how a commercial cybersecurity tool “FireEye Endpoint Security” can be used in the hybrid installation as a part of practical student exercises for cybersecurity training in the Network Forensics and Malware Forensics classes. The purpose of the student exercise in such scenario is to understand the capabilities of enterprise-class cybersecurity tools while keeping costs minimal for the university. The working environment is the installation of remote virtual security appliances and university laboratory equipment for independent students' work. This is a scaled-down virtual environment available for independent student work where FireEye Endpoint Security is used in demo and proof-of-concept mode, which requires minimal local installation while providing a full feature set of the tool."
9468330,A Cybersecurity Educated Community,"The need for cybersecurity education has grown significantly for all citizens. However, cybersecurity education has not been adequately addressed in fields outside of this domain. Cybersecurity concerns increase every time a new device connects to a network. As such, we need to increase involvement and advancement of cybersecurity education at all levels and in every discipline. Education, audit, and enforcement regarding cybersecurity are critical aspects and are the responsibility of all system stakeholders. It is no longer enough to rely on the security team to be responsible for combating cyber threats. Involvement and commitment from all stakeholders are essential and universal and begins with a cross-disciplinary reform in education. In this paper, the need to deliver cybersecurity education across all disciplines and at all levels is discussed. Specifically, the focus is at the following four types of users: K-12, college, technical professionals, and all other citizens. A curriculum roadmap that integrates cybersecurity throughout technical and nontechnical curricula is proposed as a foundation for future cyber education planning. The goal is to introduce students and citizens to the concept of cybersecurity, to ensure they can apply cybersecurity concepts, and to expose them to multiple approaches to solving cybersecurity related problems."
9186468,Design Guidelines for Machine Learning-based Cybersecurity in Internet of Things,"Cybersecurity is one of the building blocks in need of increasing attention in Internet of things (IoT) applications. IoT has become a popular target for attackers seeking sensitive and personal user data, computing infrastructure for massive attacks, or aimed at compromising critical applications. Worryingly, the industrial race toward the forefront of IoT software and device development has led to increased market penetration of vulnerable IoT devices and applications. Nevertheless, traditional cybersecurity solutions designed for personal computers often rely on heavy computation and high communication overhead, and therefore are prohibitive for IoT, given the explosive number of IoT devices, their resource-con-strained nature, and their heterogeneity. Hence, innovative solutions must be designed for securing IoT applications, while considering the peculiar characteristics of IoT devices and networks. In this article, we discuss the motivations and challenges of using machine learning (ML) models for the design of cybersecurity solutions for IoT. More specifically, we tackle the challenge of designing ML-based solutions and provide guidelines for ML-based physical layer solutions aimed at securing IoT. We propose a device-oriented and network-oriented classification and investigate recent works that designed ML-based solutions, considering IoT physical layer features, to secure IoT applications. The proposed classification helps engineers and practitioners starting in this area to better identify and understand the challenges, requirements, and up-to-date common design principles for securing IoT devices and networks considering physical layer features. Finally, we shed light on some future research directions that need further investigation."
9000590,Investigation of Chaotic Image Encryption in Spatial and FrFT Domains for Cybersecurity Applications,"The need for cybersecurity increases to protect the exchange of information for improving the data privacy. This paper presents an investigation of the encryption efficiency of the chaotic-based image block ciphering in the spatial and Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) domains. The main aim of this investigation is to examine the efficiency of different chaotic maps, while considering the parameters of the FrFT as additional keys for encryption and achieving reliable cybersecurity for robust image communication. In this paper, Cat, Baker, and Logistic map confusion approaches are applied in the spatial and FrFT domains to study and analyze the cybersecurity and ciphering efficiency of chaos-based image cryptosystems. The confusion features of the chaotic maps in spatial and FrFT domains are investigated using information entropy, differential analysis, histograms, visual observation, attack analysis, impact of noise, and encryption quality tests. Simulation results prove that the chaotic-based image encryption in the FrFT domain increases the efficiency of the confusion process and achieves a high nonlinear relation between the plainimage and the cipherimage in a symmetric ciphering approach. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the Cat-FrFT scheme is more susceptible to channel noise attacks than the Baker-FrFT and the Logistic-FrFT schemes. Hence, they can be implemented efficiently in the scenarios of noisy channels due to their high robustness to channel noise."
9302989,An Attack-Trace Generating Toolchain for Cybersecurity Study of IEC61850 based Substations,"The digitisation of modern power grid substations allows them to better support various advanced operations. However, it also poses greater risk of cyber-related attacks. There is an array of cybersecurity solutions (e.g., intrusion detection systems) available in the market to prevent, detect, or respond to cyberattacks. This calls for the creation of datasets and test cases for the validation of those cybersecurity solutions. In our recent work, we have generated a synthesized dataset for testing of cybersecurity solutions of IEC 61850 based substations. Our dataset contained traces for some typical attack-free disturbance scenarios and cyberattack scenarios in a substation. In this work, we present the toolchain we have developed to allow easy generation of such traces. We discuss the design considerations behind our toolchain and provide step-by-step guide to potential users on how to create customized trace files for specific scenarios using our toolchain. By open-sourcing the project for the broad community, we hope our toolchain will enrich the body of testing datasets for substation cyber security solutions."

We hope that our endeavor, ISAAC, will help further the boundaries of CPS research and education."
8735376,A Systems Engineering Approach To Appraise Cybersecurity Risks Of CNS/ATM and Avionics Systems,"The aggregate use of complex cyber-physical systems, incorporation of artificial intelligence and autonomy in flight operations has reconceptualised the aerospace cybersecurity paradigm to a new era. Cybersecurity is about the prevention or mitigation of malicious acts undertaken to either compromise systems directly or access valuable information that could be subject to criminal misuse. The cybersecurity of Communication, Navigation, and surveillance / Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) systems is aimed at controlling the effects of such threats and enhancing the safety of flying passengers. Besides, the cybers resilience of state-of-the-art CNS/ATM and avionics systems have been impacted by convoluted risk management issues. The security of legacy aviation and airport infrastructure has been curtailed owing to their annexure to public networks, which constitute a significant risk to the aviation industry and the general public as a whole. The existing control mechanisms in place, with the aim of assuring Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of information, have a multitude of deficiencies in deciding the extent of vulnerability of systems, the severity of impact and subsequently overall risk rating. Weaknesses in some of the security controls which are intended to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks also contribute towards this issue. A risk-based system engineering solution is envisioned in managing today's cyber-physical systems which may comprise of interwound Systems of Systems (SoS). This paper aims to investigate threats to aviation assets, vulnerabilities of aviation systems and to adopt a holistic approach to mitigate possible risks. The article also recommends a novel methodology to manage risks by enhancing the consistency and accuracy of risk attributes of CNS/ATM systems, avionics and airport systems."
8937373,Curriculum for Hands-on Artificial Intelligence Cybersecurity,"Interest and awareness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) grows at such a rate that academia and higher education struggle keeping up with the accelerating demand of industry. It is forecast that 75% of enterprise applications will use AI, Machine Learning or Deep Learning technology by 2021, yet university programs commonly place the burden on students to obtain their data science educations through elective coursework spanning multiple disparate departments. Data science requires specific mathematics preparation especially for cybersecurity students whose programs have reduced the requirements for advance mathematics to a bare minimum. To facilitate curricula preparation, and hands-on usage of AI tools, a notebook (“A Trellis For Novice AI Practitioners”) was prepared in the R programming language as a first step in introducing computer science and cybersecurity students to the concepts and capabilities of AI. A focus on an intrusion detection data set to mitigate nine common cyber vulnerabilities is used in this analysis. Trellis bridges the theoretical and practical chasm for students by building an ANN network intrusion predictive model from scratch. It serves as a template but also encourages heavy contextual modification, and may be relied upon in the beginning stages of a cybersecurity practitioner's data science activities on a wide variety of data sets in all areas of the discipline."

Experts agree that conventional security measures will soon not be enough to stop the propagation of more sophisticated and harmful cyberattacks. Recently, there has been a growing interest in mastering the complexity of cybersecurity by adopting methods borrowed from Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to support automation. In this paper, we provide a brief survey and some hints about Bayesian Network applications to intelligent cybersecurity in order to enable quantitative threat assessment for superior risk analysis and situation awareness."

9256714,Access Permissions for Apple Watch Applications: A Study on Users' Perceptions,"The pervasiveness and sheer ubiquity of wearables, such as smartwatches, has given rise to a myriad of privacy concerns. In this paper, we examine the privacy issues which arise from the permission requests framework on Apple wearables and explore how end user's perception of these can inform better and more inclusive privacy. We conduct an empirical study which explores issues pertaining to data protection, safety, trust, ethics, and cybersecurity. We conducted two Amazon Mechanical Turk studies that investigate users' perception on app permission requests for different smartwatch applications. Our findings suggest that most users lack proper understanding of the cybersecurity risks posed and were unable to construe the rationale for permissions requests for popular smartwatch applications. Furthermore, the respondents believed that app developers might misuse their data, thereby, indicating lack of trust towards these app development enterprises. The respondents also believe that the application development companies should be held accountable for their alleged involvement in data breaches and privacy issues. Further, the majority of survey respondents indicated having some unease towards data usage policies of developers. Moreover, respondents consider all common types of private data (location, health and fitness, photos etc.) susceptible to some level of data breach. Lastly, our results indicate that the study participants experienced confusion in the `usability' versus `security' conundrum-while a bare majority of the users wanted ease of access, a similar minority preferred a higher level of security. We conclude by presenting a discussion to the quandaries that can help us interweave towards reliable, secure, trustworthy, and ethical technologies."
9637070,Research on Cybersecurity Testing for In-vehicle Network,"The development of technologies such as Information Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), and industrial intelligence has made automotive cybersecurity issues more prominent. Cybersecurity issues have gradually attracted widespread attention in the field of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICV). Cybersecurity testing is an effective means to ensure the cybersecurity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Fuzzing and penetration testing are both important methods of security testing. In SAE J3061 and the impending ISO/SAE 21434, it is clearly mentioned that fuzzing and penetration testing technologies should be applied in the development of automotive cybersecurity activities, but no specific testing details are involved. The WP.29 regulations also require security tests to verify the effectiveness of security measures when conducting type approval with regard to cybersecurity. There is neither a standardized method for how to conduct automotive cybersecurity testing, nor specific testing tools. In this paper, a brief overview of the applied security testing methods in the automotive domain is provided first. Then, we present a cybersecurity testing method, which extends the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) from the perspective of testing processes. Besides, we also design and develop a security testing tool for the in-vehicle network to assist security analysis. Finally, taking Controller Area Network with Flexible Data Rate (CAN FD) as an example, the proposed method is applied to the designed testbed."
9692093,Enabling cybersecurity features using a layered connectivity to promote secure remote operation and maintenance,"The cyber attacks which resulted in power outages in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 generated a great awareness regarding the requirement for cyber secure operations. Securing the connection by employing virtual private networks (VPN) creates a layer of security around legacy systems but operating only at the network level is not sufficient to achieve a defence in depth with the required level of security expected of energy providers. Since it is common to find old software running on outdated operating systems that no longer can have its vulnerabilities patched, the security analogous to internal network provided by VPN is not sufficient to protect legacy devices with known vulnerabilities. In order to work around those issues while maintaining compatibility with legacy systems, it is possible to add layers of security virtualising the computer running the configuration tools and HMI. The virtualised machine can have all its external connections secured by the host computer and can be backed-up and restored into a different host if necessary. This paper investigates managing the access to the configuration computer on the host computer which can be interfaced with common access control strategies used by IT/OT networks with LDAP or RADIUS technologies."

8739482,Cybersecurity in New Communications Systems through 4D Array Architectures,"In this paper, an optimization-based synthesis of 4D array is performed in order to provide an additional layer of security to secure the communication signals from eavesdroppers. The security is ensured by transmitting undistorted signals along the directions of interest while maximizing the distortion elsewhere, thanks to the directional modulation (DM) characteristics of 4D array. Towards this goal, the on/off sequence of modulating pulses controlling the RF switches have been optimized by a customized strategy based on a binary Genetic Algorithm (GA). An innovative objective function based on fidelity factor (FF) which quantifies the degree of distortion as a function of angular directions is defined. Numerical and experimental results have been reported in order to validate behavior and potentialities of the proposed synthesis approach for physical layer secure communications."

The proposed scheme rather evaluates the processes applied in development and operations than investigates into the validity of the product properties itself. We argue that the resulting claims are still suitable to increase the confidence in the security of products and services resulting from such processes."

9258794,Research on Cybersecurity Risk Assessment in SCADA Networks Based on AHP-RSR,"Due to the increase in demand and use of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, it is crucial to provide a risk assessment for ensuring the normal operation of these industrial systems. In this paper, a novel approach based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Rank-Sum Ratio (RSR) is proposed to reduce the subjectivity and uncertainty of risk assessment, quantitatively and comprehensively assess the security risk level in SCADA networks. Furthermore, this method is able to shorten the time of identifying risks after the occurrence of cyber threats. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed approach is effective for relative risk evaluation for SCADA systems."
8685665,An abstraction layer for cybersecurity context,"The growing complexity and diversification of cyber-attacks are largely reflected in the increasing sophistication of security appliances, which are often too cumbersome to be run in virtual services and IoT devices. Hence, the design of cyber-security frameworks is today looking at more cooperative models, which collect security-related data from a large set of heterogeneous sources for centralized analysis and correlation.In this paper, we outline a flexible abstraction layer for access to security context. It is conceived to program and gather data from lightweight inspection and enforcement hooks deployed in cloud applications and IoT devices. We also provide a preliminary description of its implementation, by reviewing the main software components and their role."
8744218,A Packet-Length-Adjustable Attention Model Based on Bytes Embedding Using Flow-WGAN for Smart Cybersecurity,"In the studies of cybersecurity, malicious traffic detection is attracting more and more attention for its capability of detecting attacks. Almost all of the intrusion detection methods based on deep learning have poor data processing capacity with the increase in the data length. Most intrusion detection methods can only handle the header part of the traffic and omit valuable information from the payload, so they cannot detect the malicious traffic when the hacker hides the attack behavior in the payload. In this paper, we propose an attention model that can process network traffic flow with adjustable length to detect the payload-based attacks. Furthermore, we design a Flow Wasserstein GAN model to generate new network traffic data from the original data sets to enhance the network packet data and protect the user's privacy. Our model has a hierarchical structure to build the representations of bytes and packets on two levels. Moreover, two levels of attention mechanisms enable the model to pay attention to more important content when constructing the flow representation. The experiments based on the ISCX-2012 and ISCX-2017 datasets prove that the proposed model has higher performance in accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) than four state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The experiment shows that our model outperforms the existing HSAT-IDS in the detection of the generated packets."
9592112,3 CRYPTOGRAPHY DEMYSTIFIED,"stract:
In the last chapter, I introduced all the main tenets within the field of cybersecurity: confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization, and nonrepudiation. In this chapter, I further examine the field of cryptography and demonstrate how it enables several of these tenets. To help understand its importance, let's again take a look at the real-world example of Heartbleed, a security bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, which is a widely used implementation of the TLS protocol."
9427060,ASSURE: RTL Locking Against an Untrusted Foundry,"Semiconductor design companies are integrating proprietary intellectual property (IP) blocks to build custom integrated circuits (ICs) and fabricate them in a third-party foundry. Unauthorized IC copies cost these companies billions of dollars annually. While several methods have been proposed for hardware IP obfuscation, they operate on the gate-level netlist, i.e., after the synthesis tools embed most of the semantic information into the netlist. We propose ASSURE to protect hardware IP modules operating on the register-transfer level (RTL) description. The RTL approach has three advantages: 1) it allows designers to obfuscate IP cores generated with many different methods (e.g., hardware generators, high-level synthesis tools, and preexisting IPs); 2) it obfuscates the semantics of an IC before logic synthesis; and 3) it does not require modifications to EDA flows. We perform a cost and security assessment of ASSURE against state-of-the-art oracle-less attacks."
9201365,Augmenting Cybersecurity in Autonomous Vehicles: Innovative Recommendations for Aspiring Entrepreneurs,"Autonomous and connected vehicles are a collection of smart components such as sensors, Radar/Lidar, Electronic Control Units (ECUs), and cameras programmed through voluminous lines of codes, which enable a seamless communication system between the user, vehicle, and infrastructure. The concept of autonomous vehicles is gaining significant traction in the global markets, generating higher revenues, and witnessing high market penetration, thus attracting entrepreneurs to make new and disruptive innovations. However, the underlying technology and communication system of autonomous and connected vehicles are prone to the cybersecurity threats, which circumvent any product that uses sensors, transmits data over the network, and can be controlled through a remote computer or a mobile application. In this article, we attempt to outline the concerns that an aspiring entrepreneur should be aware of before entering into the autonomous vehicle industry, followed by innovative recommendations that can guide addressing the article's issues. The presented recommendations and guidelines are based on the cybersecurity principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
9390172,QKD-Enhanced Cybersecurity Protocols,"Security of QKD is guaranteed by the quantum mechanics laws rather than unproven assumptions employed in computational cryptography. Unfortunately, the secret-key rates are way too low and transmission distances are limited. The post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is proposed as an alternative to QKD. However, the PQC protocols are based on conjecture that there are no polynomial time algorithms to break the PQC protocols. To overcome key challenges of both post-quantum cryptography and QKD, we propose to use the QKD only in initialization stage to set-up corresponding cybersecurity protocols. The proposed concept is applied to both computational security and PQC protocols. The proposed QKD-enhanced cybersecurity protocols are tolerant to attacks initiated by quantum computers."
9037589,Identifying Unintended Harms of Cybersecurity Countermeasures,"Well-meaning cybersecurity risk owners will deploy countermeasures (technologies or procedures) to manage risks to their services or systems. In some cases, those countermeasures will produce unintended consequences, which must then be addressed. Unintended consequences can potentially induce harm, adversely affecting user behaviour, user inclusion, or the infrastructure itself (including other services or countermeasures). Here we propose a framework for preemptively identifying unintended harms of risk countermeasures in cybersecurity. The framework identifies a series of unintended harms which go beyond technology alone, to consider the cyberphysical and sociotechnical space: displacement, insecure norms, additional costs, misuse, misclassification, amplification, and disruption. We demonstrate our framework through application to the complex, multi-stakeholder challenges associated with the prevention of cyberbullying as an applied example. Our framework aims to illuminate harmful consequences, not to paralyze decision-making, but so that potential unintended harms can be more thoroughly considered in risk management strategies. The framework can support identification and preemptive planning to identify vulnerable populations and preemptively insulate them from harm. There are opportunities to use the framework in coordinating risk management strategy across stakeholders in complex cyberphysical environments."
8893814,Cybersecurity Planning for Artificial Intelligent Systems in Space,"CubeSats continue to proliferate and are an excellent low-cost method of remote sensing. A key piece of intelligent systems is sensory input, data storage, and data communications. With the continued miniaturization of technology, CubeSats will increase their sensory inputs with future miniaturization and enhance their robustness for autonomous operations if data and communications are secure. These futures inspire an intelligent system solution to on-orbit communications. This paper explores a dual-microprocessor approach to improve hardware cybersecurity of intelligent systems, with a view toward intensional intelligence as a means of adjudicating access to sensitive data onboard the CubeSat. With enhanced cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligent Systems (AIS) will add vital utility to otherwise vulnerable, autonomous systems. Using Systems Models-Based Thinking, we shed light on our plan to apply artificial intelligent system concepts to advance CubeSat technology. Managing technology for AIS reduces some of the uncertainties and risks associated with the space environment."
9020980,Model-Guided Infection Prediction and Active Defense Using Context-Specific Cybersecurity Observations,"Cybersecurity tools such as intrusion detection and prevention systems usually generate far too many alerts, indicators or log data, many of which do not have obvious security implications unless their correlations and temporal causality relationships are determined. In order to infer cybersecurity observations and take defensive actions for a given set of assets, this paper proposes methods to first estimate the infected and exploited assets and then take recovery and preventive actions, with the help of graphs, deep learning, and autonomous agents. The proposed motif and graph thinking analysis of cyber infection and exploitation predicts the infection states of some assets. This prediction data of infections is taken as input data by deep learning networks to enable the agents to determine effective actions for inferring adversary activities and protecting assets. The results of the infection prediction and the games of these agents show the effectiveness of actions."
9141222,"Vessels Cybersecurity: Issues, Challenges, and the Road Ahead","Vessels cybersecurity is gaining momentum as a result of a few recent attacks on vessels at sea. These recent attacks have shocked the maritime domain, which was thought to be relatively immune to cyber threats. That belief is now over, as proved by recent mandates issued by the International Maritime Organization. According to these regulations, all vessels should be the subject of a cybersecurity risk analysis, and technical controls should be adopted to mitigate the resulting risks. This initiative is laudable since, despite the recent incidents, the vulnerabilities and threats affecting modern vessels are still unclear to operating entities, leaving the potential for dreadful consequences of further attacks just a matter of ""when,"" not ""if."" In this contribution, we investigate and systematize the major security weaknesses affecting systems and communication technologies adopted in modern vessels. Specifically, we describe the architecture and main features of the different systems, pointing out their main security issues, and specifying how they were exploited by attackers to cause service disruption and relevant financial losses. We also identify a few countermeasures to the introduced attacks. Finally, we highlight a few research challenges to be addressed by industry and academia to strengthen vessels security."

9280541,From Word Embedding to Cyber-Phrase Embedding: Comparison of Processing Cybersecurity Texts,"Much of the vital information about emerging threats and the corresponding defensive measures are contained in large volumes of natural language texts online. Capturing such actionable intelligence in real-time is critical to prevent large scale attacks automatically. The ATT&CK framework is a widely recognized standard to catalog technical details of cyber threats and deploy mitigating measures. A technique in ATT&CK specifies a set of adversary actions to achieve a particular goal, such as Exfiltration over Command and Control channel. Details of the technique include encrypted traffic and encoded data. A key challenge in identifying such cyber intelligence from natural language texts is that for a given action, such as encrypted traffic, many alternative expressions are possible (e.g., send using a self-signed certificate, send using HTTPS requests). It is not practical to manually provide an exhaustive list of all such variants. We demonstrate that using cyber-phrase embedding on a cybersecurity text corpus is a promising approach to overcome such difficulties. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing models. We have created an open-source project to make our tools and data available for the cybersecurity research community."
9435453,Towards Practical Cybersecurity Mapping of STRIDE and CWE — a Multi-perspective Approach,"Cybersecurity practitioners seek to prevent software vulnerabilities during the whole life-cycle of systems. Threat modeling which is done on the system design phase is an efficient way for securing systems; preventing system flaws is easier and more efficient than patching the security of the system later on. Therefore, many Secure Software Development methods include threat modeling as an integral part of the methodology. STRIDE is a popular threat modeling method used by many practitioners. Threat modelers using the STRIDE method work with abstract threat categories, and would benefit learning about the information about current system weaknesses and vulnerabilities. The information is available on the weakness and vulnerability databases (such as the CWE and the CVE). To our knowledge, there exists no mapping between the STRIDE threats and the actual weaknesses and vulnerabilities listed on the databases, thus hindering the effectiveness of the threat modeling and the DevSecOps and Secure Software Development Life Cycle methods as a whole. This work attempts to bridge the gap by exploring possible mappings between the STRIDE threats and the CWE weaknesses, with the goal of improving the cybersecurity processes from end to end. The paper explores three different approaches for mapping the STRIDE to the CWE weakness database, and discusses the findings. The paper concludes that the mapping between the STRIDE and the CWE “Technical Impact” and “Scope” elements of the CWE entries is the most prominent for the mapping. Paper also shows that other mappings were challenged by the different conceptual backgrounds between the threats and the weaknesses. The paper also discusses the challenges caused by the inherent vagueness of the items within the frameworks and the CWE and CVE databases, causing that the mappings to these databases remain largely as a manual tasks, which should be carried out by the domain experts."

However, only a few of these numerous attack and defense frameworks provide countermeasures by linking multiple frameworks. Due to the lack of attack-defense mapped frameworks, a number of cyber security practitioners are often puzzled how to cope with cyber-attacks when it occurs. The objective of this paper is to present a tool called the ""Cyber Threat Dictionary"" to solve the problem. Cyber Threat Dictionary offers approaches and practical solutions to the threats by mapping MITRE ATT&CK Matrix to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. By providing immediate solutions to cyber security practitioners, Cyber Threat Dictionary enables effective responses against cyber-attacks."

8899445,Resiliency under Strategic Foresight: The effects of Cybersecurity Management and Enterprise Risk Management Alignment,"Rethinking organisations' risk resiliency against cyber risks has been found both successful and lacking because it is more challenging when organisations mirror past siloed approaches. In pursuit of effectiveness and resiliency, this paper examines the antecedents of Cybersecurity Management (CsM) to explore how siloed risk controls influence business effectiveness. At the same time, it explores the additional strengths in enhancing CsM through alignment with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) to ensure that handling risk is proactively, strategically, and comprehensively managed. To explore the problem, this research commenced by considering both secondary and primary qualitative data to determine the current state of strategic foresight of organisations. The authors found evidence of a granular legacy, stranded in different security domains and siloed strategic approaches."
9272234,Agent Based Cybersecurity Model for Business Entity Risk Assessment,"Computer networks and surging advancements of innovative information technology construct a critical infrastructure for network transactions of business entities. Information exchange and data access though such infrastructure is scrutinized by adversaries for vulnerabilities that lead to cyber-attacks. This paper presents an agent-based system modelling to conceptualize and extract explicit and latent structure of the complex enterprise systems as well as human interactions within the system to determine common vulnerabilities of the entity. The model captures emergent behavior resulting from interactions of multiple network agents including the number of workstations, regular, administrator and third-party users, external and internal attacks, defense mechanisms for the network setting, and many other parameters. A risk-based approach to modelling cybersecurity of a business entity is utilized to derive the rate of attacks. A neural network model will generalize the type of attack based on network traffic features allowing dynamic state changes. Rules of engagement to generate self-organizing behavior will be leveraged to appoint a defense mechanism suitable for the attack-state of the model. The effectiveness of the model will be depicted by time-state chart that shows the number of affected assets for the different types of attacks triggered by the entity risk and the time it takes to revert into normal state. The model will also associate a relevant cost per incident occurrence that derives the need for enhancement of security solutions."

The statistics, correlation, and association of variables in the spam email database `spambase' are analysed. The clustering analysis based on k-means and principal component analysis for the data dimension reduction of the database are performed. Spam-email intrusion is predicted based on the Naïve Bayesian classification and deep learning, respectively.

But due to low energy and lack of computing capabilities, the comprehensive use of such devices result in reliability and security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the lower capability of sensor devices need to operate wisely with careful technical considerations to maximize their capabilities. This paper proposes a new technique to improve reliability and cybersecurity by balanced use of sensor energy while maintaining the quality of communication. The simulation result shows that the strategy proposed is effective. A hacking strategy has also been detailed so that the security experts can consider those while designing a security suite for IoT-enabled infrastructures."
9311538,Intrusion Detection for Cybersecurity of Power Electronics Dominated Grids: Inverters PQ Set-Points Manipulation,"This work provides cybersecurity analytics for a high photovoltaic (PV) penetrated distribution network, representing future power electronics dominated grid (PEDG). Firstly, the impact of active and reactive power (PQ) set-points manipulation on the network is studied. Then, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed for identifying the potentially compromised PV inverters in the network. The proposed IDS is based on defining the normal, safe, and abnormal operation regions of the PV inverters from point of view of the steady state voltage stability of the network. These three-operation regions are identified by utilizing active power, reactive power, and voltage (PQV) limits of each specific grid-following inverter in the network. Each grid-following inverter’s PQV contour includes the information of network topology, inverter ratings, and inverter controller. The developed PQ limits are integrated into the centralized secondary control layer for realization of the proposed IDS. Furthermore, the proposed secondary control layer is capable of providing remedial actions during an anomaly event to enhance the grid resiliency. The theoretical analyses are verified by several attack scenarios for a network of grid-following inverters."
8724160,Simulation-Based Reduction of Operational and Cybersecurity Risks in Autonomous Vehicles,"The expected adoption of fully autonomous vehicles has raised concern about possible operational and cybersecurity risks associated with their safety. This research studies the use of a virtual autonomous vehicle in a simulation environment as a method to reduce such risks. In doing so this research contributes the process and development of a virtual model that mirrors a previously built prototype of an autonomous vehicle. It also contributes the design of the operational simulation environment for the model. Through the comparison of the physical and virtual model's machine learning training data, it is shown that the virtual model can act as a valid substitution for the physical model allowing for a greater potential for risk reduction."

From 2014, the Soft targets are the much-discussed topic in the security area. The most security measures are against violent attacks, but the threat is also inside cyber-attacks. In our research, we analyzed possible ways of attacks, and we tried to find the best way for security measures. We create the module for the PSIM, which we use for viewing and categorizing of data from protected objects. In this article, we present the initial study about our research, in which we are focused the transport system. There is a big threat in a disruption, damage or destruction of this system.

We propose the usage of penalization factors, which help us to process a security audit and to find out the security situation in our objects or events."
9237715,Software Engineering: The First Line of Defense for Cybersecurity,"Cybersecurity has become an area of critical concern due to an ever-growing number of security breaches. Some of these breaches compromise personal information, exposing individuals and firms to potential identity theft, fraud and other maladies. Other attacks seek to gain control of systems for use in attacking as part of bot nets and other indirect attack techniques. Yet other attacks target cyber-physical systems whose compromise could potentially lead to the injury or death of individuals relying on or nearby the equipment. This paper considers the role of software engineering in preventing cyberattacks and discusses the types of software engineering failures that translate into vulnerabilities that can be attacked. Prospective solutions and areas of needed future research are discussed."
9254422,Cybersecurity Evaluation Methodology for Distributed Energy Resources: Industrial Demonstration,"With the widespread integration of renewable energy resources, the occurrence of electric power output control is increasing in Japan, especially for photovoltaic (PV) power plants. The practical application of smart inverters that can perform electric power output control more flexibly over the network has gradually progressed. Still, there is a remaining issue regarding how to determine the implementation method and scope of the cybersecurity evaluation for distributed energy resources (DER), including smart inverters. Therefore, we generated a set of security evaluation items, tools, and supporting environments. We validated these with academics, manufacturers, and electric power companies in realistic settings, after which we were finally able to arrange evaluation methods. In this paper, we describe how we performed the industrial demonstration experiments and what we learned through the trials."
9453885,Flipped mastery and gamification to teach Computer networks in a Cybersecurity Engineering Degree during COVID-19,"This paper presents the results of applying the flipped learning methodology in its flipped mastery variant, complemented with some gamification strategies to teach computer networks in a cybersecurity engineering degree at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Spain. The main advantage of the flipped mastery methodology is that students really learn the subject, they don't just pass it. Introducing gamification strategies, such as badges, points, and the Escape Room activity, was also important to improve student's motivation. The methodology was easily adapted to the COVID pandemic scenario, as most of the material was already available online. Nevertheless, work in class was intended to be team-based and due to the restrictions on mobility that had to be changed. The use of breakout rooms to group students during the online sessions was the implemented solution. All sessions and exams were performed remotely, and the academic results and satisfaction with the methodology were very high."
9559519,Secure Data Management using Distributed Storages for Stronger Cybersecurity in Cloud Service,"As data used in IT services increases exponentially, cloud storage-based services that normally store user data on the cloud storage which is controlled by cloud storage service providers and restore data only when necessary are being activated. Accordingly, the importance of technique for securing data stored in cloud storage is increasing. In particular, as the importance of data increases, an attack on cloud storage services is considered not as a simple threat to the safety of individual services, but as an attack from the perspective of cybersecurity that can threaten the well-being of society where the stored data is utilized. In this paper, we propose a technique for providing cloud service safety. Specifically, we consider three major requirements for providing information security of data stored in the cloud storage: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In the case of the previously proposed technique, only some of the three major requirements are intensively analyzed and countermeasures are proposed. Since there is a corresponding technique for individual requirements, it is possible to respond to each security requirement by parallelly applying the existing technologies. However, in the case of a system designed with such simple approaches, it is difficult to provide all security requirements by actually grafting it due to the difference in the configuration method of each hypothesis, or even if possible, efficiency impairment occurs. In this paper, we designed a technique that can efficiently meet the three major requirements from this point of view."
8331841,Optimal Assignment of Sensors to Analysts in a Cybersecurity Operations Center,"A cybersecurity operations center (CSOC) analyzes a large volume of alerts generated by intrusion detection systems, which process data from a number of sensors. Sensors are assigned to analysts, and the number of sensors is much larger than the number of analysts at the CSOC. Hence, sensors are grouped into clusters, which are allocated to analysts for investigation. There are two essential properties that must be met in the above grouping and allocation process: 1) meeting the cluster's requirement for specific analyst expertise mix, complete tool coverage that allows the analysts to handle the type of alerts generated, and analyst credentials such as security clearances; and 2) minimizing and balancing the number of unanalyzed alerts among clusters at the end of the daily work shift because an imbalance or a large number of unanalyzed alerts among clusters due to factors such as lack of analyst credentials or tooling expertise in a cluster would pose a security risk to the organization. Current practice at CSOCs is to group and then to allocate, which may not meet the above properties because grouping and allocation steps are done independently that remain static for a long time despite uncertainties such as day-to-day changes in alert generation rates and analyst absenteeism. This paper meets both properties by presenting an optimization model, in which grouping of sensors to clusters and analyst allocation to clusters is achieved simultaneously. The integrated methodology produces optimal sensor grouping and analyst allocation that is adaptable to changing shift conditions."
9182015,Cybersecurity Analysis for the Communication Protocol in Smart Grids,"Smart Grids are smart electrical networks that use communication technologies to service the power grid. They are an interconnected, self-detecting-adjusting-correcting network of distributed loads and generators. The Substation Automation lies at the heart of Smart Grids, and IEC 61850 is an innovative communication and automation standard within Smart Grids substations. This study aims to explore a cybersecurity analysis of the communication protocols recommended under the IEC 61850 standard, namely GOOSE messaging protocol. GOOSE messaging has been chosen as the candidate protocol for testing due to its increasing prevalence in the standard and adoption by industry. Relevant attack vectors have then been investigated. Finally, this study demonstrated that GOOSE messages are vulnerable to a variety of attack vectors, such as Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, which leave the systems prone to spurious operations or faulty tripping."

Against such threats, we propose a range of embedded instruments that are capable of real-time hardware assurance and online monitoring."
9229690,Defensive Programming for Smart Home Cybersecurity,"Cybersecurity has become a real issue in the development of smart services in the smart home domain, which is formed by a System of Systems where several smart objects are connected to each other and to the Internet. However, these connections expose the devices to possible attackers inside or outside the network, who may exploit software or hardware vulnerabilities to achieve malicious goals. To alleviate this issue, the use of defensive programming assertions can allow the behaviour of smart objects to be monitored and checked for correctness. Furthermore, open source intelligence tools, such as the Shodan search engine, provide features that could be leveraged to detect potential vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose an approach for the monitoring of Systems of Systems in the smart home domain exploiting the defensive programming paradigm in combination with Shodan APIs."
9131732,Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenges of Electrical Power Systems of the Future,"Electrical Power Systems (EPSs) are among the most prominent critical infrastructures of our digital society. Assets, systems and networks of most other critical infrastructure sectors depend heavily on EPSs and would fail in the event of persistent electricity supply problems. This should make EPSs attractive targets for cyberattacks, so it is somewhat surprising that few large-scale successful cyberattacks on the electricity sector have been reported so far.EPSs structures are undergoing deep changes that will accelerate over the next years. A convergence of environmental concerns and technological evolution is leading to the widespread use of distributed renewable microgeneration, electric vehicles, distributed energy storage, Internet of Things, smart grids and software-defined operating devices. These game-changing innovations are reshaping EPSs. The previously well-ordered computational environment where a limited number of agents interacted in predictable ways will gradually receive new layers of agents, where thousands or even millions of them will buy or sell services in a kind of giant open market. The search for individual advantages or profits rather than overall system welfare will guide the actions of these new participants.This work examines the traditional structure of EPSs from a cybersecurity point of view as well as foreseeable changes. It will also look at associated risks and discuss possible approaches to mitigate them."
9379453,Improved Cybersecurity of Power Electronic Converters Used in Hydropower Plant,"Hydro plant control system (HPCS) has gained a high level of attention in recent years in view of variable speed operation, digitization, and cyber-attacks on process controllers and measures suggested in recently released IEC Standard 62433 (2019): Security for Industrial Automation and Control Systems. Digitization makes power electronics converters potentials for the internet of things (IoE) and endows them with networking capability. But it increases cybersecurity risk. To protect the converters, serving in hydropower plant, from cyber-attacks, a parallel control framework comprises of the model predictive controller (MPC) as a digital and proportional-integral controller (PIC) as an analog controller is designed in this paper. Under normal operation, this parallel framework enhances the dynamic performances of the system. Once a cyber-attack happens, MPC is isolated physically from the speed control loop, and PIC maintains continuity of converter operation. Further, the effects of hacked signal (speed reference) have been analyzed. A 250 MW hydro generating unit is considered in this study. The proposed configuration is simulated using matlab simulink environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system."

This article presents a review of the literature in the area of game theoretical modelling of network/cybersecurity and identifies a number of challenges in this area that need to be addressed.
9458202,OctoBot: Human Activity Orchestration System for Cybersecurity Experiment and Exercise,"Cybersecurity experiment and exercise in a testbed environment required normal traffic to ensure a better result, a learning experience, and the effectiveness of the whole process. The traffic camouflages the attack traffic from the attacker by generating different types of activities and tasks that are usually generated by the human. Unfortunately, in a large-scale experiment and exercise, it is impractical to employ a large number of humans to generate normal traffic. There are several methods available to produce a single human activity from an agent, but automating it from multiple agents with multiple and different activities is very challenging. By learning and adopting the concept of BotNet, we designed an orchestration system for a human agent (i.e., bot), called OctoBot, to generate human activity that is easy to be deployed and utilized. This paper discusses primary considerations in designing and implementing our system with an example of unique bot development. It also presents deployment experience in the production testbed environment with an example use case for a virtual environment to show the potential usability of our system."

However, having various enabling technologies like Network Slicing introduces new threats. In this work, we propose to carry out a systematic review of the literature that studies Cybersecurity in this environment. The Kitchenham & Carters method is used, posing three research questions. As a result, 41 papers that met the semantic search criteria were analyzed in the Science Direct Elsevier database, IEEE eXplorer digital library, and ACM digital library. The main security issues that affect 5G Network Slicing technology and the possible solutions that mitigate the vulnerabilities found were identified."
8854039,A Lightweight Blockchain Based Cybersecurity for IoT environments,"Recently, Blockchain (BC) attracts a lot of research's to study their salient features in order to adopt it into various domains. BC promise to address security and privacy preservation issues in a distributed manner and eliminating the centralized concept. However, Internet of Thing (IoT) environments is constricted resources with limited capabilities in terms of; computation, storage, and energy that deter to adopt BC in a straightforward manner due to its intensive computational requirements and bandwidth consumption overhead. To address those issues, this paper introduces a Lightweight Blockchain based Cybersecurity (LBC) for IoT environments. Unlike the Proof of Work (PoS) and Proof of Stake (PoS) in Bitcoins, we aim to mitigate the heavy computational cost that required in a consensus algorithm to meet the IoT requirements. To provide scalability feature to the proposed scheme, Edge Block Manager (EBM) and Aggregation Block Managers (ABM) have been introduced; where EBM aims to overcome the limited capabilities of local IoT resources and manages local BC in centralized manner. While ABM constitute of numerous of EBM to manages the public BC in a distributed manner. Our novel proposed scheme can preserve high throughput and low latency. Obviously, waiting period, verification, and block appending period have been mitigated. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is resisted against typical attacks."
9092330,An Exploration of Disinformation as a Cybersecurity Threat,"Disinformation or ""fake news"" has continuously proven to be a pervasive threat in the digital space. The spread and persistence of disinformation especially in the social networking media sites currently factors as one of the most challenging threat for users and content administrators alike. Its ecosystem encompasses several attributing factors including but not limited to humans as information users and source, social communication model as its channel, current trust models in place as defense and guards against it, and finally the archival correction that may halt its persistence in the social space. In this paper, the author aims to explore the dynamics of the several interacting fields i.e. Psychology and Computer Science, their influence on its phenomenon, which provides an ideal interdisciplinary and holistic approach to its reduction and management. Another equally important section in this paper is its attempt to advocate to formally recognize disinformation as a cybersecurity threat for its prospective future categorization. The possible application of discourse analysis as a potential technological tool for its detection as solution is also discussed."
9542829,The Role of Cybersecurity and HPC in the Explainability of Autonomous Robots Behavior,"Autonomous robots are increasingly widespread in our society. These robots need to be safe, reliable, respectful of privacy, not manipulable by external agents, and capable of offering explanations of their behavior in order to be accountable and acceptable in our societies. Companies offering robotic services will need to provide mechanisms to address these issues using High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities, where logs and off-line forensic analysis could be addressed if required, but these solutions are still not available in software development frameworks for robots. The aim of this paper is to discuss the implications and interactions among cybersecurity, safety, and explainability with the goal of making autonomous robots more trustworthy."
8945983,Cybersecurity and the Blockchain: Preventing the Insertion of Child Pornography Images,"The fight against child pornography on the Internet is difficult due to the inability of controlling the dissemination of content. While the cryptocurrency applications of a blockchain, such as Bitcoin, primarily store financial data in blockchain transactions, numerous approaches to arbitrarily insert other types of data are possible, including content in the form of readable text and images. Thus, considering the blockchain principles of decentralization, immutability, censorship resistance, and net neutrality, we are suddenly presented with a set of new challenges for mitigating the storage and distribution of illicit and potentially illegal data. Such a novel cybersecurity threat requires an adequate solution within a decentralized paradigm. In stark contrast to the countermeasures proposed in literature for filtering out illicit content from other legitimate data, this study proposes the first appropriately designed solution for effectively mitigating these threats whilst maintaining fidelity to the underlying core principles of the blockchain. Through the designed approach, arbitrary images in blockchain transactions are detected, and whilst leveraging an off-chain content filtering service, successful discrimination is achieved between clean and illicit embedded data. The proposed methodology was evaluated directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, successfully demonstrating a pioneering and viable approach for thwarting the insertion of child pornography images. The presented solution within this research is made available on GitHub [1] for open-source use."
9407241,Attack Surface Assessment for Cybersecurity Engineering in the Automotive Domain,"Connected smart cars enable new attacks that may have serious consequences. Thus, the development of new cars must follow a cybersecurity engineering process as defined for example in ISO/SAE 21434. A central part of such a process is the threat and risk assessment including an attack feasibility rating. In this paper, we present an attack surface assessment with focus on the attack feasibility rating compliant to ISO/SAE 21434. We introduce a reference architecture with assets constituting the attack surface, the attack feasibility rating for these assets, and the application of this rating on typical use cases. The attack feasibility rating assigns attacks and assets to an evaluation of the attacker dimensions such as the required knowledge and the feasibility of attacks derived from it. Our application of sample use cases shows how this rating can be used to assess the feasibility of an entire attack path. The attack feasibility rating can be used as a building block in a threat and risk assessment according to ISO/SAE 21434."
9139644,Beyond the Prisoner’s Dilemma: the Social Dilemmas of Cybersecurity,"The Prisoner's Dilemma represents an ubiquitous approach to security modeling that emphasizes adversarial relationships between actors. Adopting this approach helps understand ambiguous relationships in information domains. Despite the fact that some actors might adopt these frames, the Prisoner's Dilemma reflects only one of many possible social dilemmas. In this paper, we outline a computational approach to cybersecurity based on Interdependence Theory. Interdependence Theory provides a means to decompose payoff matrices into social influence components based on the amount of control actors and partners have in a situation. It additionally accounts for joint control that develops from the mutual decisions of both players. By focusing on two-person, two-option games, this approach can model many different social situations that reflect nor-mal and anomalous network activity."
9619733,Cybersecurity maturity model for providing services in the financial sector in Peru,"In this paper, we proposed a cybersecurity maturity model for providing services to organizations in the financial sector. To develop this proposal, existing frameworks and models have been taken as a reference, expanding their scope by integrating cloud security and privacy capabilities. In this way, the proposed model is supported by a measurement tool that facilitates diagnosis and result visualization. The evaluation process is performed based on the fulfillment of controls, which are evaluated on a scale of five levels of maturity: 1. Initial, 2. In Development, 3. Defined, 4. Managed and 5. Optimized. The results are grouped by domains and functions. The model was validated with pilot studies in two entities from the financial sector in Lima, Peru. In the performed validation, the preliminary results showed an average acceptance level of 4.3 on a 1 to 5 scale while the obtained maturity level was 3. Those preliminary results allowed us to propose activities which eliminate the gaps found as well as improve the organization's capabilities in the evaluated process."

9148566,A Survey of Blockchain-based Cybersecurity for Vehicular Networks,"The development of vehicular networks has greatly improved the efficiency and safety of intelligent traffic systems. However, it also introduces additional security threats into the system. The special characteristics of vehicular networks, such as dynamic topology, huge network scale and so on, make it difficult to adopt the traditional security solutions directly into this scenario. In addition, the single point failure problem of the centralized security mechanisms is also a big challenge. Recently, blockchain technology, which is a distributed database, is a potential approach to address these security issues. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the existing blockchain-based cybersecurity mechanisms is presented with the corresponding performance analysis. The purpose of this work is to provide a guideline for the further study in the application of blockchain in the vehicular network security area."
9108949,Managing Effective Collaboration in Cybersecurity Alliances Using Social Computational Trust,"To enable effective collaboration, trust in the ability of an alliance member to adequately perform joined tasks is an essential element. Such trust needs to be organized, evaluated and maintained amongst all alliance members. In this paper, we present a social computational trust model (SCTM) to evaluate trust as featured by alliance members. Specifically, we consider three different distinctive trustworthiness elements: competence, benevolence ,and integrity. To evaluate the trust of a particular member, we take into account two sources of evidence as well as the context of interactions between the parties. Based on our SCTM model, we have developed an algorithm that ranks the members based on their capabilities, behavior, and integrity in the context of a task that is expected to be performed. A cybersecurity alliance case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the SCTM model. Experimental results from a real-world testbed are used to validate the presented SCTM model in selecting the right partner to defend against cyber-attacks."

9629152,Cybersecurity as the protection of cyberspace,"Humans in the 21st century engage in technology mediated communication much of our lives. It has become a dimension of human existence, and since the COVID-19 pandemic is found increasingly in work, study, and leisure. If we search for a meaning in this communication message, we may describe the totality of this communication technology as cyberspace. Cyberspace is a combination of mass media and technology in a new form. Complete with its own practices, behaviors, and manifestos, functioning cyberspace can be considered a global basis of human existence in the same way as unpolluted air or the absence of a pandemic. While cyberspace is resistant to totalizing control, it is nevertheless fragile, and requires protection if humans are to achieve its benefits. Cybersecurity can be considered simply the protection of immediate, practical and ongoing technology elements. Yet to protect any part of cyberspace, it is necessary to protect all of cyberspace."
9033821,Analysis of Cyber-Attack in Big Data IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems - A Technical Approach to Cybersecurity Modeling,"The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are generating widespread data. Their success depends on a well secured infrastructure, which necessitates providing a robust infrastructure by securing the CPS and IoT system setup against the possibility of cyberattacks. With an increased utilization of CPS as well as widespread implementation of IoT with low power wireless sensors, the security vulnerability is growing, and increasing the possibility of cyberattacks. This paper has discussed models of how different categories of CPS can be stabilized in the event of a disaster, and analyzed how possible cyberattacks can be mitigated by taking a technical approach to model the cybersecurity."
9678713,Effective Learning of Cybersecurity Concepts with Model-Eliciting Activities,"As security is a crucial aspect in the process of developing software systems, software engineers must have a strong understanding of security concepts for an application being developed and tested. There has been a growing demand for these skills to be taught on all knowledge levels in computing courses. This paper builds on a study related to a series of security modules designed to meet that demand for teaching security concepts to students in computer science courses. Six small lessons in three security modules are implemented into a CS2 course, and the outcomes of this implementation are assessed. Each concept in the modules is broken up into a general description of the security problem, sample code written in Java, and sample code of the solution. Along with the security modules, an open-ended, problem-solving Model-Eliciting Activity (MEA) was developed as a project for students to demonstrate an understanding of the security concepts. Experimental studies were conducted to investigate the teaching effectiveness of implementing cyber security modules with the MEA project and students' experiences in conceptual modeling tasks in problem solving. After implementing the security modules with the MEA, students showed a good understanding of cyber security concepts, and the instructor's beliefs about teaching shifted from teacher-centered to student-centered. 41.7% of the developed solutions from the MEA groups showed a sufficient degree of creativity, and 58.3% of the solutions seemed suitable for real-world implementation. The initial activities leading to student developed solutions effectively prepared students within the scope of the course, but additional discussion and resources may be necessary to expand on creativity and practicality."
9673554,Towards Cybersecurity Risk Management Investment: A Proposed Encouragement Factors Framework for SMEs,"Disregarding cybersecurity risk management by SME decision-makers became a phenomenon that needs to be studied. Specifically, the lack of cybersecurity risk management investments, which will lead to further risks. The Covid-19 pandemic has proven how the seriousness of cybersecurity threats could increase dramatically in a short period. The authors attempt to detect the role of SMEs' decision-makers in addressing cybersecurity risks nowadays and to suggest avenues for further studies. This paper aims to find out the encouragement factors and how they positively impact cybersecurity risk management investment in SMEs based on conducting several interviews with decision-makers in the sector. The results reveal that eight factors are playing a major role in encouraging SMEs' decision-makers to invest in cybersecurity risk management as a strategic priority. These encouragement factors have been categorised as follows technological context, organizational context, and environmental context. Importantly, a proposed framework of these factors has been discussed widely in order to illustrate expected returns of this investment on the SMEs' sector in the long term. Meaningfully, this research contributes to the financial cybersecurity risk management literature with new insight into the current cybersecurity risk management investment situation in SMEs."

9273931,CHEESE: Cyber Human Ecosystem of Engaged Security Education,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents CHEESE, a platform for cybersecurity education that complements formal classroom instruction with hands-on experience. With the ubiquitous use of computing devices and applications today, the protection of personal and privileged information is a persistent challenge. Modern software applications are typically complex pieces of code that borrow from various preexisting software libraries. Consequently, a flaw in one piece of software can have far-reaching and often unintended security implications that malicious actors can exploit. Thus, cybersecurity education needs to be transformed from a purely academic enterprise for cybersecurity researchers into a necessary skill that is imparted to the current and future IT workforce at large. CHEESE aims to impart such skills. CHEESE is composed of CHEESEHub, a public web-platform hosting demonstrations of cybersecurity concepts, a set of lessons complementing the demonstrations, and a community-driven approach to the contribution of new demonstrations and lessons. CHEESE is intended to supplement and enhance traditional cybersecurity education with hands-on training that has been shown to improve concept retention and understanding. Instructors can incorporate CHEESE into their teaching in several ways: by utilizing one or more of the demonstrations hosted on the publicly-accessible CHEESEHub in conjunction with the web-accessible lessons; by deploying their own version of CHEESEHub with a custom set of demonstrations and lessons; or by developing their own lesson plan which borrows from and combines one or more demonstrations on CHEESEHub. The use of CHEESEHub only requires a web-browser and can hence be employed in a wide variety of educational and training settings from K-12 schools through university."
9425195,Cyber Resiliency in the Context of Cloud Computing Through Cyber Risk Assessment,"Cyber resiliency in Cloud computing is one of the most important capability of an enterprise network that provides continues ability to withstand and quick recovery from the adversary conditions. This capability can be measured through cybersecurity risk assessment techniques. However, cybersecurity risk management studies in cloud computing resiliency approaches are deficient. This paper proposes resilient cloud cybersecurity risk assessment tailored specifically to Dropbox with two methods: technical-based solution motivated by a cybersecurity risk assessment of cloud services, and a target personnel-based solution guided by cybersecurity-related survey among employees to identify their knowledge that qualifies them withstand to any cyberattack. The proposed work attempts to identify cloud vulnerabilities, assess threats and detect high risk components, to finally propose appropriate safeguards such as failure predicting and removing, redundancy or load balancing techniques for quick recovery and return to pre-attack state if failure happens."
9498208,A Comparative Study of Cybersecurity Awareness on Phishing Among Employees from Different Departments in an Organization,"Cybersecurity is an important issue for people who usually use the Internet for their purposes (e.g., ecommerce) in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic. For cyberthreats, phishing, which can be sent via email, can harm information systems in the organization. However, the risks from this kind of threats can be reduced if the employees have cybersecurity awareness. To prove this hypothesis with Thai employees, this paper presents a comparative study of cybersecurity awareness enhancement associated with the employees who work in different departments within the same organization in Bangkok, Thailand. In this study, the first phishing attack simulation was conducted before providing knowledge and training in cybersecurity to the employees and attacking with the second simulation. After result collection and analysis, it has been found that there are significant differences in cybersecurity awareness level between Thai employees from technology-based departments (e.g., IT department) and social-based departments (e.g., HR department) within the same organization. Of course, the technology-based employees are the better. Furthermore, it has been found that the cybersecurity awareness level of Thai employees from the social-based department, which were poor when compared to the other one, was improved obviously after they were involved with the cybersecurity awareness enhancement processes."

With the growing processing power of computing systems and the increasing availability of massive datasets, along with novel concepts and architectures for deep learning, AI algorithms have led to major breakthroughs in many different areas including cybersecurity. Nowadays AI has become one of the key enablers to studying and addressing cybersecurity-relevant problems at large in several application domains such as for intrusion detection, malware detection and spam detection. However, it is important to consider that AI can be used also by attackers to continually improve their techniques and refine their offensive capabilities. Studying the effectiveness of AI is thus critical to ensure modern cybersecurity equipped to face the emerging threats allowed by malicious uses of AI. In this talk I will showcase several examples of recent progress in applying AI into cyber-threat detection problems and will provide a glimpse into exciting future directions that promise to have a profound impact on cybersecurity."
9124982,Parents' awareness and readiness for smart devices' cybersecurity,"Smart Devices technologies are evolving and introducing more cybersecurity challenges while developing. One of the cybersecurity challenges in the social aspect is the high level of smart devices exposure for children and teens, with the biggest burden of protecting the children lies on the parents. This paper presents an assessment of the current children level of exposure to cybersecurity threats and measuring the awareness and readiness of parents to deal with these threats. Searching through available literature, the research topic of children protection from smart devices revealed either limited or outdated content considering the nature of the topic field development over time. In addition, there is a lack of information found on the chosen focus which are children aged six years or below. This research directed to explore these areas by measuring the level of smart devices cybersecurity exposure for children with age six years or below using exploratory surveying methods and quantitative questionnaires to collect the data from parents. Results showed 98.2% of children are exposed to at least one smart device and more than 92.2% of children are exposed to social media applications. Around half of respondents allow their children to play games which are not suitable for their age even though some are monitoring the children while playing and others are checking the content of the games. The key findings of this study shall be used to design strategies of child cyber protection and find a solution to help minimizing cybersecurity risks."

9483948,Extracting Key Factors of Cyber Hygiene Behaviour Among Software Engineers: A Systematic Literature Review,"The advent of new technologies and the rapid growth of internet users have given birth to the menace of cyber-crime. Unfortunately, it is increasing at an alarming pace. This situation calls for good cyber hygiene behavior to secure digital lives. Cyber hygiene behaviour holds a significant role in terms of cybersecurity across the globe. There is a dire need to understand better the user variations associated with good or bad cyber hygiene behaviour and an improved view of what users do to encourage good cyber hygiene. Cybersecurity attacks are rising due to recent advancements in ICT and the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0). Software development organizations are among the crucial sectors suffering from cybersecurity issues. These organizations are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks because they lack proper cybersecurity culture. Although many initiatives have been taken by academia and industry to address this rising issue, the problem still exists for Software development organizations because good cyber hygiene behaviour is not observed, which is a prerequisite to reduce cyber threats. This study performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers published during 2010 – 2020. The key factors influencing software engineers’ cyber hygiene behaviour intention are extracted from the published literature. The study examined 35 research papers out of 5,270 found from IEEE Xplore, Emerald Insight, SpringerLink, and ScienceDirect databases.

9668265,A Study of Machine Learning Techniques for Cybersecurity,"Cybersecurity has recently seen enormous technological and operational transformations with data science driving the transition. The key of building an automated and intelligent security system is to extract security event patterns or insights from cybersecurity data and develop a matching data-driven model. Data science applies diverse scientific methodologies, machine learning techniques, processes and systems to comprehend and analyze actual events with data. This paper provides a study of cybersecurity data science in this paper, where data is acquired from relevant cybersecurity sources and analytics supplement the newest data-driven trends to provide more effective security solutions. Comparing with traditional cybersecurity computing processes, the notion of cybersecurity data science enables more actionable and intelligent computing."
9256804,PhishGAN: Data Augmentation and Identification of Homoglyph Attacks,"Homoglyph attacks are a common technique used by hackers to conduct phishing. Domain names or links that are visually similar to actual ones are created via punycode to obfuscate the attack, making the victim more susceptible to phishing. For example, victims may mistake “linkedin.com” for “linkedin.com” and in the process, divulge personal details to the fake website. Current State of The Art (SOTA) typically make use of string comparison algorithms (e.g. Levenshtein Distance), which are computationally heavy. One reason for this is the lack of publicly available datasets, hindering the training of more advanced Machine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, no one font is able to render all types of punycode correctly, posing a significant challenge to the creation of a dataset that is unbiased toward any particular font. This coupled with the vast number of internet domains pose a challenge in creating a dataset that can capture all possible variations. Here, we show how a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), PhishGAN, can be used to generate images of hieroglyphs, conditioned on non-homoglyph input text images. Practical changes to current SOTA were required to facilitate the generation of more varied homoglyph text-based images. We also demonstrate a workflow of how PhishGAN together with a Homoglyph Identifier (HI) model can be used to identify the domain the homoglyph was trying to imitate. Furthermore, we demonstrate how PhishGAN's ability to generate datasets on the fly, facilitating the quick adaptation of cybersecurity systems to detect new threats as they emerge."
9663786,The European Commission contribution to cybersecurity through the ECHO project,"This paper introduces the work carried out within project ECHO (European network of Cybersecurity centres and competence Hub for innovation and Operations), one of the four pilot projects financed under the H2020 framework aiming to connect and share knowledge across multiple domains, while building a common cybersecurity strategy for Europe, inside the framework of the European Cybersecurity Competence Center located in Bucharest. The question is: what can EU countries do to strengthen the Union’s cyber defence and ensure a secure cybersecurity ecosystem that would protect citizens, economy and infrastructures from cyber-attacks? The first step is to assure that EU citizens are aware of these risks and are ready to fight them. To this purpose, ECHO project develops: (1) a marketplace of multi-sector services coming from multiple cyber ranges, the E-FCR (ECHO Federated Cyber Range), to be applied in several areas, with particular attention to the Healthcare sector, (2) a distributed platform, the E-EWS (ECHO Early Warning System), for information sharing across organizational boundaries that provides companies with a common operational cyber threat situation picture tailored for different types of users (from technical cyber experts to management executives). This paper gives an overview of the architecture of these solutions, highlighting why they could become paramount for a standardised cybersecurity training at European and international levels."
9698626,Trends in Cybersecurity Management Issues Related to Human Behaviour and Machine Learning,"The number of organisational cybersecurity threats continues to increase every year as technology advances. All too often, organisations assume that implementing systems security measures like firewalls and anti-virus software will eradicate cyber threats. However, even the most robust security systems are vulnerable to threats. As advanced as machine learning cybersecurity technology is becoming, it cannot be solely relied upon to solve cyber threats. There are other forces that contribute to these threats that are many-a-times out of an organisation's control i.e., human behaviour. This research article aims to create an understanding of the trends in key cybersecurity management issues that have developed in the past five years in relation to human behaviour and machine learning. The methodology adopted to guide the synthesis of this review was a systematic literature review. The guidelines for conducting the review are presented in the review approach. The key cybersecurity management issues highlighted by the research includes risky security behaviours demonstrated by employees, social engineering, the current limitations present in machine learning insider threat detection, machine learning enhanced cyber threats, and the underinvestment challenges faced in the cybersecurity domain."
9637404,Lessons Learnt Conducting Capture the Flag CyberSecurity Competition during COVID-19,"This innovative practice full paper describes our experiences conducting cybersecurity capture the flag (CTF) competition for cybersecurity enthusiast participants (inclusive of both tertiary students and working professionals) local and abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning and appreciation of cybersecurity concepts for our participants with little to no technical background can be challenging. Gamification methods such as capture the flag competition style is a popular form of cybersecurity education to help participants overcome this challenge and identify talents. Participants get to apply theoretical concepts in a controlled environment, solve hands-on tasks in an informal, game-like setting and gain hands-on active learning experience. CTF competitions can be held at physical locations or virtually. However, the COVID-19 pandemic catalyses all major events that are traditionally held physically to go virtual (likewise for physical CTF events). The pandemic limits our physical interactions, changes the dynamics of our engagements with the participants and how participants learn. We have to adapt our CTF competition design and conduct it in a virtual format during the COVID-19 pandemic that is compliant with local pandemic regulations as well. This paper describes these adaptations for a semi-international CTF competition conducted for our participants. We conduct the competition entirely virtual and adapt the cybersecurity exercises to be attempted without the participant's physical presence. While we devise ways to validate participants' involvement, it is still more challenging to limit cheating than in a physical environment. However, with appropriate mitigating controls in place (reducing risks to acceptable levels), we were able to achieve similar outcomes compared to a physical event despite the lack of physical interactions. Over 1400 participants registered for our competition, and with the help of over 40 staff, we successfully conducted this 4...

9637127,Integrating Andragogy Theory into a Multidisciplinary Curriculum to Achieve a Connected Program for a Doctorate in Cybersecurity,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a case study on constructing and implementing a connected program in the Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) in Cybersecurity at Marymount University. We adapted a connected curriculum framework to this professional doctorate program based on two overarching pillars: andragogy theory and a multidisciplinary perspective. We use an andragogical instructional methodology that follows a learner-centered teaching philosophy to promote professional and adult learner engagement. Furthermore, the D.Sc. program takes a multidisciplinary approach to bridge and integrate domain-specific silos such as technology and its evolution, risk management, legal compliance, human factors, machine learning, business impact, and more. This integration helps enhance students' knowledge in multiple disciplinary specializations, focusing on problem-solving skills across the various domains important in cybersecurity. Building on these two pillars, our connected program model integrates five dimensions of connectivity to connect 1) academic learning and research with the workplace, 2) research activities and research-related curriculum over time, 3) various disciplines related to real-world cybersecurity challenges, 4) students with each other, across phases and with alumni, and 5) students with research and researchers across multiple domains. This paper's primary contribution is to demonstrate an innovative andrological and connected approach to tackle the ever-changing cybersecurity threats by cultivating the next generation of cybersecurity leaders with both advanced technical and refined management skills. We further showcase the potential of externalizing this framework in other settings and discuss future research work."
9722640,A study on the application of mission-based cybersecurity testing and evalulation of weapon systems,"In this paper, we investigate the ongoing research on ways to improve cybersecurity throughout the life cycle of weapon systems applied in advanced countries such as the United States(U.S.), and present effective security evaluation measures by analyzing restrictions on acquiring weapon systems in Republic of Korea. We consistently performed mission-based risk assessment in cybersecurity tests and evaluation plans at the entire stage to support decision-making by providing key information to major decision-making organizations in a timely manner. We propose a plan to carry out simulated penetration by establishing rules of engagement so that protection measures can be verified for vulnerabilities identified in terms of cybersecurity. In addition, we identified the areas where artificial intelligence can be applied to the proposed cybersecurity test and evaluation system, and suggested future development plans. Through this, we supplemented our ability to support major decisions by integrating mission-based risk assessment factors into the cybersecurity test and evaluation system research conducted so far to identify risks in a timely manner between acquisition projects."
9653049,"Network Data Curation Toolkit: Cybersecurity Data Collection, Aided-Labeling, and Rule Generation","Cybersecurity network data curation is the collection, labeling, and packaging of datasets that contain artifacts that are important in the cybersecurity domain. These assets are essential for cybersecurity research and key for defense technologies and systems to detect and respond to anomalies caused by adversaries. However, tools for data curation are lacking in all domains of cybersecurity, including enterprise and the military. Curation fuels empirical research and validation of protection, detection, and prevention techniques. Closing the gap will require the development of research-driven tools and technologies that facilitate and enforce not only collection and labeling, but also standardization and distribution. This paper describes a novel tool, called the Network Data Curation Toolkit (NDCT), which simplifies the process of collecting network traffic, keystrokes, mouse clicks; allows network packet labeling; automatically generates intrusion detection rules; and provides a visualization of results. Moreover, the tool has a built-in mechanism for exporting all data into a single distributable file. The tool is modular to allow extension and to facilitate its incorporation into existing workflows. We demonstrate the use of NDCT in two case studies. We first show how NDCT can augment cybersecurity exercises by having participants label their network data. We then describe a separate system that was embedded with the NDCT, which provides a workspace, allowing users to curate data through a multi-session environment, including generating intrusion detection rules for malware."
9714649,Towards the use of Participatory Methods in Cybersecurity research in rural Africa: A grassroots Approach,"As a research domain, Cybersecurity has been around for a long time. However, research methods and outputs have been deeply rooted in western epistemologies, thus leaving pockets of communities in rural Africa at possible risk. Even though some research on the African continent aims to address cybersecurity awareness, they still utilize a top-down approach, with interventions designed and developed for rural end users often without their input. This position paper proposes a new research focus in cybersecurity research within rural communities in Africa and for cybersecurity research in rural African communities. Participatory methods have been utilized in human-computer interactions research with greater impact of end-product adoptability, sense of ownership of communities involved and overall design implications for design research as a whole. We therefore argue that for cybersecurity research to have sustainable effects for these communities on the fringes of society, a participatory design approach needs to be considered in cybersecurity research."

8870156,A Large-Scale Empirical Study on Control Flow Identification of Smart Contracts,"Background: Millions of smart contracts have been deployed to Ethereum for providing various applications. Recent studies discovered many severe security and performance issues in smart contracts by applying static program analysis techniques to them. Given a smart contract, the majority of these analysis techniques need to first construct its control flow graph, which connects basic blocks through control flow transfers (CFTs), before conducting further analysis. Aims: The objective of this work is to understand the capabilities of static program analysis techniques to identify CFTs, and to investigate how static program analysis techniques can be improved if the CFTs are complemented. Method: We perform a comprehensive empirical study on six widely-used tools for smart contract analysis by using all deployed smart contracts to understand their capabilities to recognize CFTs. We capture all execution traces of all smart contracts to evaluate the number of CFTs covered by traces that are not found by those tools. We enhance a state-of-the-art tool, OYENTE for discovering vulnerabilities in smart contracts with the CFTs covered by traces to investigate how the tool is improved. Results: These studied tools fail to identify all CFTs due to several reasons, e.g., incomplete code patterns. Execution traces effectively complement these tool in recognizing CFTs. By including the CFTs covered by traces, the false negative rate of OYENTE can be reduced by up to 30%. Conclusions: Our study underlines the ineffectiveness of static analysis techniques due to the incapabilities of CFT identification."
9640212,Sniffing Serial-Based Substation Devices: A Complement to Security-Centric Data Collection,"One of the key aids in ensuring security in the substation is data collection. Collected substation data can be applied to data analytics to infer the substation's security status. However, most of the data collected are measurement logs and Ethernet-based traffic data. The industrial network market share shows that serial-based protocols still exist, and it will take some time before they are phased out. Also, data from serial-based traffic is sourced mostly from SCADA; thus, when SCADA is compromised, the data inferred from it can be misleading. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on data collection involving serial-based protocols such as DNP3 serial, Modbus-RTU and IEC 60870-5-101; hence, we propose a custom serial sniffer that captures data from serial devices and logs them. Such complementary data can be transmitted to a Security Operations Centre (SOC) to provide a second view to confirm the substation's status. Our bench-marking of the serial sniffer shows negligible utilization of CPU and memory resources for DNP3 serial, Modbus-RTU and IEC 60870-5-101; and we can conclude that it is stable across all protocols. Our sniffer code can be embedded into serial-to-Ethernet protocol converters due to its lightweight nature. Our work can complement data collection within substations until the migration to Ethernet-based protocols is complete."

Given that many decision variables in common use-cases are discrete rather than continuous, we develop a multiple-objective optimization framework over discrete variables known as task value calculus (TVC). The underlying mathematical models in TVC utilize a multiple-valued algebraic framework where both the objective functions and the system or process structure models are represented as multiple-valued functions. TVC allows for fast multiple-objective optimization through the use of the multiple-valued decision diagram (MDD) data structure. The algorithms and structures internal to TVC are described and experimental results are provided. TVC is implemented with a simple graphical user interface making it suitable for use by both laypersons and domain experts."

There is an urgent requirement to identify tampered images through effective image authentication techniques. In this paper, we propose a new image tampering detection method using the deep learning-based semantic image segmentation network. It works under the observation that tampering regions are typically the semantic object ones in an image. One of the state-of-the-art neural networks for semantic image segment task, namely DeepLab V3+, is used to extract rich and high level features from large amounts of prepared tampering-labeled images. Both spatial regional and boundary tampering artifacts are explored in an encode-decoder network. Experimental results on public image forgery datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed tampering detection method."
9108873,Timing Covert Channels Detection Cases via Machine Learning,"Currently, packet data networks are widespread. Their architectural features allow constructing covert channels that are able to transmit covert data under the conditions of using standard protection measures. However, encryption or packets length normalization, leave the possibility for an intruder to transfer covert data via timing covert channels (TCCs). In turn, inter-packet delay (IPD) normalization leads to reducing communication channel capacity. Detection is an alternative countermeasure. At the present time, detection methods based on machine learning are widely studied. The complexity of TCCs detection based on machine learning depends on the availability of traffic samples, and on the possibility of an intruder to change covert channels parameters. In the current work, we explore the cases of TCCs detection via machine learning and study the possibility to implement learning machines algorithms for detecting TCCs under conditions of varying covert channel characteristics: flow capacity and encoding scheme."

9680279,So {U} R CERER: Developer-Driven Security Testing Framework for Android Apps,"Frequently advised secure development recommendations often fall short in practice for app developers. Tool-driven (e.g., using static analysis tools) approaches lack context and domain-specific requirements of an app being tested. App developers struggle to find an actionable and prioritized list of vulnerabilities from a laundry list of security warnings reported by static analysis tools. Process-driven (e.g., applying threat modeling methods) approaches require substantial resources (e.g., security testing team, budget) and security expertise, which small to medium-scale app dev teams could barely afford. To help app developers securing their apps, we propose SO{U}RCERER 1 1 Sourcerer is a fictional character depicted in the fantasy novel series ‘Discworld’ written by Terry Pratchett. https://discworld.fandom.com/wiki/Sourcerer, a guiding framework for Android app developers for security testing. So{u}rcererguides developers to identify domain-specific assets of an app, detect and prioritize vulnerabilities, and mitigate those vulnerabilities based on secure development guidelines. We evaluated So{u}rcererwith a case study on analyzing and testing 36 Android mobile money apps. We found that by following activities guided by So{ U} Rcerer,an app developer could get a concise and actionable list of vulnerabilities (24–61 % fewer security warnings produced by So{u}rcererthan a standalone static analyzer), directly affecting a mobile money app's critical assets, and devise a mitigation plan. Our findings from this preliminary study indicate a viable approach to Android app security testing without being overwhelmingly complex for app developers."
9345849,Optimization Model for an Individualized IoT Ambient Monitoring and Control System,"The urban population has increased in many parts of the world, concentrating mainly in large cities, inside buildings. Thus, it is important to optimize these buildings' environments, whether in terms of its users' comfort, or in terms of energy resources. This article presents an optimization model with the goal of guaranteeing individualized comfort parameters. It is based in a flexible HVAC IoT system, previously developed using the fog computing paradigm. In order to test the model's performance, a set of simulations was performed, using real data from our IoT laboratory. The comfort values were obtained by training a Naïve Bayes model with data found in the literature to represent hot-natured and cold-natured profiles. The simulation's result shows that the system adequately reacts to internal and external changes in the environment, keeping the indoor temperature inside the comfort range most of the time, while still using few HVAC resources."
9699812,A Correlation Fault Attack on Rotating S-Box Masking AES,"Masking is a commonly used countermeasure for protecting cryptographic implementations from power side channel analysis. Rotating S-Box masking (RSM) is a state-of-the-art masking technique, whose effectiveness has been testified in ongoing worldwide DPA contest. However, masking does not provide sufficient protection against active side channel attacks through fault injection. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective correlation fault attack on two generations of RSM AES schemes. We demonstrate through mathematical formulations that the random offset and shuffles in RSM do not affect fault fusion. Round keys can be recovered by leveraging the strong linear correlation in fault effects at multiple locations. Experimental results have demonstrated that random fault injections in the penultimate and antepenultimate rounds allow full recovery of the last round key with two correct-faulty ciphertext pairs or four faulty ciphertexts under the same plaintext. Our method has a key search complexity of 2 16 and eliminates the time-consuming fault attack template or model training process."
9468121,Recommending Location for Placing Data Collector in the OPC Classic,"Industrial automation requires exchange of data from various systems. To enable interoperability, OPC (Open Platform Communications) has been used as interfacing standard to avoid direct interaction with internal architectures. In its nascent, OPC classic devices are based on the Microsoft COM/DCOM and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) technologies and thus inherit many of their security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is essential to secure OPC classic and no previous work has contributed to comparative study of data collection on OPC-classic client, server, network, and SCADA to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we propose various OPC classic architectures' data collection systems by designing several use cases using OPC classic client, server, and SCADA simulators. We use two OPC classic sniffers for data collection. We also benchmark the use cases in terms of CPU and memory utilization to suggest the best location for placing the data collector. We observed that memory resource utilization at the client side is the lowest, hence it is the best location for data collection. However, if the client has a CPU resource constraint, then data should be collected at the server side."

In order to adapt the neural network to the characteristics of the side channel data, the network model structure was adjusted appropriately. In the experiment, the traditional multivariate Gaussian distribution and the ResNet-based convolutional neural network model were used to establish templates. The final experimental results show that the success rate of template attacks based on the ResNet model is 94.5%, which is 9.4% higher than the traditional template attacks."
9536956,DT-SSIM: A Decentralized Trustworthy Self-Sovereign Identity Management Framework,"In a ubiquitous environment enclosing cooperative Internet of Things (IoT) devices, individuals, and entities, Digital Identity Management (DIM) becomes critical and challenging. DIM pertains to device identities authentication and verification to enable trustworthy service exchange, data collection, and decision making. DIM is the supporting pillar for all online services and the foundation for security and authentication mechanisms. Due to the extreme heterogeneity, scale, and configuration complexity of such environments, enabling trustworthy DIM is crucial and seriously challenging. In an IoT context, devices use local (Digital Identities) DIs stored within a tamper-proof unit and verified by a centralized authority for authentication. The recent attacks on IoT systems showed how vulnerable such a design is. It is also an inherent problem that influences humans. From that, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has emerged as a decentralized DIM approach embracing the concept of portable selfpossession identity. SSI was presented to decouple the DI from the owner to enable large-scale cooperation. However, DI storage and verification still occur on the device and in a centralized manner. Utilizing a local single-point-of-failure storage memory for verifiable credentials is one of the considerable drawbacks in contemporary SSI. In this regard, this paper introduces DTSSIM, a novel Decentralized Trustworthy Self-Sovereign Identity Management framework. DT-SSIM integrates the secret share scheme with the Blockchain-based smart contracts technologies to provide transparent and trustworthy SSI-based digital identity management services for IoT. Storing IoT identity credentials outside the devices’ local storage preserves the identity credentials from being tampered with or misused. Evaluations and discussions show the resiliency assessment of the system and the cost and estimated running times for verification processes in DTSSIM."

IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet. IoT requires multi-facet security solutions where the communication is secured with confidentiality, integrity, and service availability. However, IoT Sensor Node has the requirement to minimize power usage and computational power due to the requirement to be miniature. Therefore, the challenge of implementing security in the IoT Sensor Node must be addressed. Even if the IoT Sensor Node is protected with encryption and authentication, the protection is not comprehensive to sustain a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The DoS attack is considered one of the security threats that may affect IoT network’s quality service and reduce IoT Sensor Node’s lifespan. Hence, mitigation shall be needed to secure IoT Sensor Node. This paper aims to propose a lightweight Denial of Service (DoS) Detection Systems algorithm to secure IoT Sensor Node.

9470952,Trading Behind-the-Scene: Analysis of Online Gold Farming Network in Auction House System,"Owing to the widespread use of smartphones, various online games based on mobile platforms are being launched. Although mobile games have the advantage of better accessibility compared to PC games, there is a limitation in that it is difficult to input specific actions. To overcome this limitation, game companies apply autoplay systems to support users. Autoplay (with macro or game bot programs) without human interaction was previously regarded as a cheating play. To provide a more comfortable and easy gaming experience to users, most mobile games currently provide autoplay functionality. Such introduction means that along with gold farming groups (GFGs) all users can use a game bot. Therefore, game companies prevent profitproducing activities of GFGs by introducing an in-game economic system in which a real money trading (RMT) is impossible. However, GFGs still operate by abusing an auction house. Our study uses the 3-month transaction logs of a mobile game that introduces an auction house as an in-game economic system. We observe the abuse that makes RMTs possible through the auction house and propose a method of identifying abuse solely through a transaction log. We analyzed the GFGs using the identified abuse and confirmed that the GFG consists of a single role."
9050733,A Machine Learning Based Framework for Identifying Influential Nodes in Complex Networks,"In complex networks, identifying influential nodes is of great importance for its wide applications. Traditional centrality methods are usually directly based on topological structures of networks, and different centrality methods consider different structural characteristics related to the functional importance. However, in many scenarios, it always exists a complex and nonlinear relationship between the functional importance of a node and its various features including local location, global location, etc., which is hard to be described by one centrality. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a framework based on machine learning to measure the importance of nodes in the propagation scenario. This framework first constructs the feature vector of each node based on the existing centrality methods which can reflect nodes' different topological structures and the infection rate which is an important factor in the propagation scenarios, then labels each node based on the real propagation ability obtained from simulated propagation experiments based on SIR model, last uses seven machine learning algorithms to learn the complex relationship between the real propagation ability of each node and its various structural features. The experimental results in real-world networks show that the classification accuracy of the model based on machine learning is generally higher than that of the traditional centrality methods based on one certain topology."
8741031,Golden Gates: A New Hybrid Approach for Rapid Hardware Trojan Detection using Testing and Imaging,"Hardware Trojans are malicious modifications on integrated circuits (IC), which pose a grave threat to the security of modern military and commercial systems. Existing methods of detecting hardware Trojans are plagued by the inability of detecting all Trojans, reliance on golden chip that might not be available, high time cost, and low accuracy. In this paper, we present Golden Gates, a novel detection method designed to achieve a comparable level of accuracy to full reverse engineering, yet paying only a fraction of its cost in time. The proposed method inserts golden gate circuits (GGC) to achieve superlative accuracy in the classification of all existing gate footprints using rapid scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and backside ultra thinning. Possible attacks against GGC as well as malicious modifications on interconnect layers are discussed and addressed with secure built-in exhaustive test infrastructure. Evaluation with real SEM images demonstrate high classification accuracy and resistance to attacks of the proposed technique."
9136620,CPU vs GPU performance of deep learning based face detectors using resized images in forensic applications,"Accurate and fast face detection is a crucial step in forensic applications such as surveillance, facial fugitives recognition, and child sexual abuse detection. Several deep-learning-based methods addressed the face detection problem with high accuracy but they require a large computation power and processing time. Although GPUs have been used to speed-up computations, nowadays multiple generations of GPU architectures are available (e.g. Turing, Pascal or Keppler) making difficult to choose the most appropriate for face detection. In this work, we evaluate the speed-accuracy trade-off of three deep-learning-based face detectors in various CPUs/GPUs considering images reduced to different proportions as input. We successfully used this image resizing strategy in one previous work to improve the performance of face detection with Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM). The results showed that the best speed-accuracy trade-off is achieved using the Pascal and Turing GPUs with images reduced to 50% of its original size."

9391501,A Multimodal Feature Fusion-Based Method for Individual Depression Detection on Sina Weibo,"Existing studies have shown that various types of information on the online social network (OSN) can help predict the early stage of depression. However, studies using machine learning methods to accomplish depression detection tasks still do not have high classification performance, suggesting that there is much potential for improvement in their feature engineering. In this paper, we first construct a dataset on Sina Weibo (a leading OSN with the largest number of active users in the Chinese community), namely the Weibo User Depression Detection Dataset (WU3D). It includes more than 10,000 depressed users and 20,000 normal users, both of which are manually labeled and rechecked by specialists. Then, we extract text-based word features using the popular pretrained model XLNet and summarize nine statistical features related to user text, social behavior, and pictures. Moreover, we construct a deep neural network classification model, i.e. Multimodal Feature Fusion Network (MFFN), to fuse the above-extracted features from different information sources and further accomplish the classification task. The experimental results show that our approach achieves an F1-Score of 0.9685 on the test dataset, which has a good performance improvement compared to the existing works. In addition, we verify that our multimodal detecting approach is more robust than multimodel ensemble ones. Our work could also provide new research methods for depression detection on other OSN platforms."
9288279,Fair Detection of Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning,"Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning technique that aggregates partial models trained by a set of clients on their own private data to obtain a global model. This technique is vulnerable to security attacks, such as model poisoning, whereby malicious clients submit bad updates in order to prevent the model from converging or to introduce artificial bias in the classification. Applying anti-poisoning techniques might lead to the discrimination of minority groups whose data are significantly and legitimately different from those of the majority of clients. In this work, we strive to strike a balance between fighting poisoning and accommodating diversity to help learning fairer and less discriminatory federated learning models. In this way, we forestall the exclusion of diverse clients while still ensuring detection of poisoning attacks. Empirical work on a standard machine learning data set shows that employing our approach to tell legitimate from malicious updates produces models that are more accurate than those obtained with standard poisoning detection techniques."

9730600,Classifying Malicious Domains using DNS Traffic Analysis,"Malicious domains are one of the major threats that have jeopardized the viability of the Internet over the years. Threat actors usually abuse the Domain Name System (DNS) to lure users to be victims of malicious domains hosting drive-by-download malware, botnets, phishing websites, or spam messages. Each year, many large corporations are impacted by these threats, resulting in huge financial losses in a single attack. Thus, detecting and classifying a malicious domain in a timely manner is essential. Previously, filtering the domains against blacklists was the only way to detect malicious domains, however, this approach was unable to detect newly generated domains. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have helped to enhance the detection capability of domain vetting systems. A solid feature engineering mechanism plays a pivotal role in boosting the performance of any ML model. Therefore, we have extracted effective and practical features from DNS traffic categorizing them into three groups of lexical-based, DNS statistical-based, and third party-based features. Third party features are biographical information about a specific domain extracted from third party APIs. The benign to malicious domain ratio is also critical to simulate the real-world scheme where approximately 99% of the traffic is devoted to benign. In this paper, we generate and release a large DNS features dataset of 400,000 benign and 13,011 malicious samples processed from a million benign and 51,453 known-malicious domains from publicly available datasets. The malicious samples span between three categories of spam, phishing, and malware. Our dataset, namely CIC-Bell-DNS2021 replicates the real-world scenarios with frequent benign traffic and diverse malicious domain types. We train and validate a classification model that, unlike previous works that focus on binary detection, detects the type of the attack, i.e., spam, phishing, and malware.

8952686,Hybrid Attention-Based Prototypical Network for Unfamiliar Restaurant Food Image Few-Shot Recognition,"As eating-out became an indispensable part of our daily lives, demand for the food recognition of unfamiliar restaurant increased significantly due to health-care. Although there are many researches on generic food recognition, there are relatively fewer studies on restaurant food image recognition. Meanwhile, it becomes extremely challenging for restaurant food image recognition due to insufficient food image. Prototypical network is common utilized to address the such a task in recent years. Although the methods based on prototypical network achieve impressive results in capturing similarities feature of the same food category, it fails to highlight important information on feature and instance level. Toward this end, we propose an effective food image recognition scheme by incorporating hybrid attention mechanism into prototypical network in this paper. Specifically, the image feature is first captured by convolutional neural network (CNN). Then the image attention weights yielded by instance-based attention mechanism are used to modulate the image feature of CNN for constructing class prototypes. And feature-based attention mechanism is employed to grasp important information of image for enriching image representation. Extensive experimental results on the large food image dataset verify that the performance of our proposed classification scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art ones."
8735833,"Joint Learning of NNeXtVLAD, CNN and Context Gating for Micro-Video Venue Classification","Currently, micro-videos have grown explosively on various online social platforms. Accordingly, how to encode them to yield effective representation attracts our attention. NeXtVLAD is such an effective network that aggregates frame-level features into a compact supervector. However, the discriminant capability of such a supervector is still limited due to the lack of non-linear transformation and L2 normalization at the head and tail of original NeXtVLAD network, respectively. In order to address such problems, we propose an improved neural network architecture, normalized NeXtVLAD (NNeXtVLAD), which is extended with ReLU function and L2 normalization. In the light of such a new network, we build up an end-to-end framework which jointly learns NNeXtVLAD, CNN layer, and context gating for micro-video venue classification. Specifically, we first apply NNeXtVLAD layers as three-stream architecture to aggregate visual, acoustic, and textual features. We then pack and embed the aggregated features into CNN layer for enhancing the sparse concept-level representation. Finally, context gating is used to capture the interdependency among different network activations. Extensive experimental results on a real-world micro-video dataset exhibit that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 scores."
9617416,Generative Adversarial Network for Integrated Circuits Physical Assurance Using Scanning Electron Microscopy,"Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) provide the researchers in Failure Analysis and Reliability (FAR) as well as Hardware Security (HS) with new opportunities to design novel systems to locate security failures or malicious modifications. Such developments in automation and verification modes are extremely helpful in particular for government agencies who must physically assure chips with billions of transistors within critical applications. AI based techniques such as deep learning can provide a high-performance detection and recognition of elements from Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) images acquired from Integrated Circuits (ICs) and understand unseen images if they are trained well. However, they require a large and diverse set of images for building their knowledge. Possessing a large number of manufactured designs as well as the high cost and execution time associated with the image acquisition process are the major bottlenecks for creating a sufficient dataset. Alternatively, conventional data augmentation techniques such as intensity change, noise injection, rotation, and translation are not always able to project the variations of images acquired by SEM with different acquisition parameters. Furthermore, augmentations like rotation, translation, and shear might generate unacceptable augmented cell structures. This paper proposes a unique approach to detect logic cells on SEM images and use the extracted samples to generate diversified synthetic logic cell images by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to address insufficient data problems. We introduce an image quality assessment metric for the synthetic dataset in order to study the qualification of generated samples for recognition computations."
9283056,A Novel Approach for Cantonese Rumor Detection based on Deep Neural Network,"Twitter is a popular social networking platform. While people enjoy the news and anecdotes on Twitter, there are also lots of rumors, which have a negative impact on users and can compromise social order. Among these rumors, many of them are written in Cantonese. At present, the research of English rumor detection is relatively comprehensive, but Cantonese rumors are rarely studied, which brings great challenges to the detection of Cantonese rumors on Twitter. Firstly, there is no available benchmark dataset of Cantonese rumors. Secondly, it is difficult to completely extract the features of rumors. Thirdly, the classical detection approaches are not effective in detecting Cantonese rumors. In this paper, we collected and annotated Cantonese rumors on Twitter and obtained a relatively complete Cantonese rumor dataset. Next, 27 statistical features, involving four categories (user, content, propagation, and comment-based), are extracted to distinguish rumors and non-rumors in Cantonese. Seven of these features are newly proposed in this paper. Then, a novel deep learning model called BLA (namely BERT-based Bi-LSTM network with Attention mechanism) is built for Cantonese rumors detection on Twitter. BLA takes advantage of both statistical and semantic features to effectively detect Cantonese rumors. The experimental results show that the BLA model outperforms other detection models in Cantonese rumor detection."

8701426,Phishing Email Detection Using Improved RCNN Model With Multilevel Vectors and Attention Mechanism,"The phishing email is one of the significant threats in the world today and has caused tremendous financial losses. Although the methods of confrontation are continually being updated, the results of those methods are not very satisfactory at present. Moreover, phishing emails are growing at an alarming rate in recent years. Therefore, more effective phishing detection technology is needed to curb the threat of phishing emails. In this paper, we first analyzed the email structure. Then, based on an improved recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNN) model with multilevel vectors and attention mechanism, we proposed a new phishing email detection model named THEMIS, which is used to model emails at the email header, the email body, the character level, and the word level simultaneously. To evaluate the effectiveness of THEMIS, we use an unbalanced dataset that has realistic ratios of phishing and legitimate emails. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of THEMIS reaches 99.848%. Meanwhile, the false positive rate (FPR) is 0.043%. High accuracy and low FPR ensure that the filter can identify phishing emails with high probability and filter out legitimate emails as little as possible. This promising result is superior to the existing detection methods and verifies the effectiveness of THEMIS in detecting phishing emails."
8493319,Practical Applications of Improved Gaussian Sampling for Trapdoor Lattices,"Lattice trapdoors are an important primitive used in a wide range of cryptographic protocols, such as identity-based encryption (IBE), attribute-based encryption, functional encryption, and program obfuscation. In this paper, we present software implementations of the Gentry-Peikert-Vaikuntanathan (GPV) digital signature, IBE and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) schemes based on an efficient Gaussian sampling algorithm for trapdoor lattices, and demonstrate that these three important cryptographic protocols are practical. One important aspect of our implementation is that it supports prime moduli, which are required in many cryptographic schemes. Also, our implementation uses bases larger than two for the gadget matrix whereas most previous implementations use the binary base. We show that the use of higher bases significantly decreases execution times and storage requirements. We adapt IBE and CP-ABE schemes originally based on learning with errors (LWE) hardness assumptions to a more efficient Ring LWE (RLWE) construction. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first implementations employing the Gaussian sampling for non-binary bases of the gadget matrix. The experimental results demonstrate that our lattice-based signature, IBE and CP-ABE implementations, which are based on standard assumptions with post-quantum security, provide a performance comparable to the recent state-of-the-art implementation works based on stronger/non-post-quantum assumptions."

These great challenges usually represent a great opportunity for technological development, since technological solutions are a significant part of the effort to overcome crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception to this historical trend. We present in this work the development of a technological solution for one challenge imposed by the corona virus outbreak: disinfection of enclosed spaces. Hence, the objectives of this work were: 1 - To present some of the technical choices made to develop the sanitization solution using uvc light; 2 - To present a methodological framework to adapt R&D work to the needs of social/physical distance; 3 - To assess the productivity of the members of the UIoT laboratory during this remote work period. The solution development was carried out by a multidisciplinary team and, in order to evaluate the proposed methodology, a questionnaire was used to assess the team member's perception of productivity. Its results show an overall quality increase, and an individual quantity increase regarding the project's outputs. We concluded that the projects' results were better than what was expected at the beginning of the year."

9418094,Smart Secure: A Novel Risk based Maturity Model for Enterprise Risk Management during Global Pandemic,"With the onset of the global pandemic, organizations have had to embrace digital transformation and adapt to the new normal. Digital transformation has helped global workforce to work from remote locations and ensure business continuity. However, this has also resulted in a significant surge in cyber attacks due to an increase in attack surface and rogue threat actors. Security Leaders and CFOs are facing a taxing challenge to decide on where and how to invest to secure their organizations and perform enterprise cybersecurity risk management in context of the financial constraints that most organizations are facing at the moment. We propose an efficient and risk-based cybersecurity maturity model called “Smart Secure”, for guiding security leaders to perform smart & efficient enterprise risk management. This would help in efficient distribution of available resources for information systems based on level of risk & criticality of the application, for their organization. Thus, providing a solution for efficient cybersecurity funding and prioritization to help improve overall cybersecurity posture for the organization."
9395448,Artificial Intelligence Based Intrusion Detection System for IEC 61850 Sampled Values Under Symmetric and Asymmetric Faults,"Modern power systems require increased connectivity to implement novel coordination and control schemes. Wide-spread use of information technology in smartgrid domain is an outcome of this need. IEC 61850-based communication solutions have become popular due to a myriad of reasons. Object-oriented modeling capability, interoperable connectivity and strong communication protocols are to name a few. However, power system communication infrastructure is not well-equipped with cybersecurity mechanisms for safe operation. Unlike online banking systems that have been running such security systems for decades, smartgrid cybersecurity is an emerging field. A recent publication aimed at equipping IEC 61850-based communication with cybersecurity features, i.e. IEC 62351, only focuses on communication layer security. To achieve security at all levels, operational technology-based security is also needed. To address this need, this paper develops an intrusion detection system for smartgrids utilizing IEC 61850`s Sampled Value (SV) messages. The system is developed with machine learning and is able to monitor communication traffic of a given power system and distinguish normal data measurements from falsely injected data, i.e. attacks. The designed system is implemented and tested with realistic IEC 61850 SV message dataset. Tests are performed on a Modified IEEE 14-bus system with renewable energy-based generators where different fault are applied. The results show that the proposed system can successfully distinguish normal power system events from cyberattacks with high accuracy. This ensures that smartgrids have intrusion detection in addition to cybersecurity features attached to exchanged messages."
8806002,Enhancing Information Sharing and Visualization Capabilities in Security Data Analytic Platforms,"Collecting and processing Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) data is becoming a fundamental approach for obtaining cybersecurity threat information and awareness. Different types of useful information and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are obtained from OSINT sources, which keep security analysts updated about new and possible threats against the IT infrastructures they protect. However, skimming through various news feeds is a time consuming process and a source of all kinds of information (sometimes unuseful and not related to the monitored infrastructure) for any security analyst. Based on these shortcomings, we propose a Context-Aware OSINT Platform as a tool for enhancing visualization and information sharing capabilities in security data analytic platforms. The tool is not only able to collect OSINT data, but also to process it and filter only the relevant parts, thus enriching the attributes of the detected data, and consequently, decreasing the amount of information and the time required to analyze and act upon."
9441148,Cyber Shield Security Awareness Program,"Information is a critical asset in any organization to achieve its strategic goals. For this, organizations enforce physical, logical, and administrative controls to protect their information from being corrupted, manipulated, or leaked. However, some organizations are unaware that some employees, with little awareness of cybersecurity threats, are an easy target for attackers. Nowadays, companies implement security awareness using policies, procedures, and training sessions, to list a few. Traditional information security training sessions have relied heavily on presentation slides and videos. This paper aims to improve the employees' security awareness by developing an interactive video game, Cyber Shield Game, which includes various embedded threat scenarios. The proposed game consists of two levels. The Password Complexity Level trains players about password threats. The Physical Security Level aware the employees about storage and disposal of confidential documents. Further, two surveys, pre and post-game, are conducted to estimate the players' knowledge and experience level in cybersecurity threats. The proposed security awareness program is applied to ten employees randomly chosen from different institutions. Experimental results indicate that a security awareness program is more interactive than traditional awareness methods. Results also indicate that the proposed program improves the employees' security awareness level by 51%."
9252851,Resilient Machine Learning for Networked Cyber Physical Systems: A Survey for Machine Learning Security to Securing Machine Learning for CPS,"Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are characterized by their ability to integrate the physical and information or cyber worlds. Their deployment in critical infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However, harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment. An attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending information from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium, thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most research work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS. However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain functional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant methodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient. This article is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions between resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper concludes with a number of research trends and promising future research directions. Furthermore, with this article, readers can have a thorough understanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area."
9280538,Weaponizing Unicodes with Deep Learning -Identifying Homoglyphs with Weakly Labeled Data,"Visually similar characters, or homoglyphs, can be used to perform social engineering attacks or to evade spam and plagiarism detectors. It is thus important to understand the capabilities of an attacker to identify homoglyphs - particularly ones that have not been previously spotted - and leverage them in attacks. We investigate a deep-learning model using embedding learning, transfer learning, and augmentation to determine the visual similarity of characters and thereby identify potential homoglyphs. Our approach uniquely takes advantage of weak labels that arise from the fact that most characters are not homoglyphs. Our model drastically outperforms the Normal-ized Compression Distance approach on pairwise homoglyph identification, for which we achieve an average precision of 0.97. We also present the first attempt at clustering homoglyphs into sets of equivalence classes, which is more efficient than pairwise information for security practitioners to quickly lookup homoglyphs or to normalize confusable string encodings. To measure clustering performance, we propose a metric (mBIOU) building on the classic Intersection-Over-Union (IOU) metric. Our clustering method achieves 0.592 mBIOU, compared to 0.430 for the naive baseline. We also use our model to predict over 8,000 previously unknown homoglyphs, and find good early indications that many of these may be true positives. Source code and list of predicted homoglyphs are uploaded to Github: https://github.com/PerryXDeng/weaponizing_unicode."
9125007,Experimental Study of Secure PRNG for Q-trits Quantum Cryptography Protocols,"Quantum cryptography doesn’t depend on computational capabilities of intruders; it uses inviolability of quantum physics postulates (postulate of measurement, no-cloning theorem, uncertainty principle). Some quantum key distribution protocols have absolute (theoretical and informational) stability, but quantum secure direct communication (deterministic) protocols have only asymptotic stability. For a whole class of methods to ensure Q-trit deterministic quantum cryptography protocols stability, reliable trit generation method is required. In this paper, authors have developed a high-speed and secure pseudorandom number (PRN) generation method. This method includes the following steps: initialization of the internal state vector and direct PRN generation. Based on this method TriGen v.2.0 pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) was developed and studied in practice. Therefore, analysing the results of study it can be concluded following: 1) Proposed Q-trit PRNG is better then standard C ++ PRNG and can be used on practice for critical applications; 2) NIST STS technique cannot be used to evaluate the quality (statistical stability) of the Q-trit PRNG and formed trit sequences; 3) TritSTS 2020 technique is suitable for evaluating Q-trit PRNG and trit sequences quality. A future research study can be related to developing a fully-functional version of TritSTS technique and software tool."
9647848,A Novel Trust Model In Detecting Final-Phase Attacks in Substations,"A substation’s security is paramount because it is an integral part of the Smart Grid for the transmission and distribution of electricity. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have become the bane of the substation because they can remain undetected for a period until final attacks are launched. A lot of existing techniques may not be real-time enough to detect these final attacks. Trust, even though less investigated, can be used to tackle these attacks. In this paper, we present a trust model designed specifically for the Modbus communication protocol that can detect final attacks from APTs when a substation is compromised. This model is formed from the perspective of the substation device and was successfully tested on two publicly available Modbus datasets under three testing scenarios. The external test, the internal test, and the internal test with IP-MAC blacklisting. The first test assumes attackers’ IP, and MAC addresses are not part of the substation network, and the other two assume otherwise. Our model detected the attacks within each dataset and also revealed the attack behaviour within the two datasets. Our model can also be extended to other protocols, and this has been marked for future work."
9559514,ART: Automated Reclassification for Threat Actors based on ATT&CK Matrix Similarity,"Given the perniciousness of threats posed by state-sponsored advanced persistent threats (APTs), identifying cyber threat attribution of the cyber threat actors (CTA) is of paramount importance for deterring cyber-attacks by APTs. As state-sponsored APT groups have been especially active in the past decade, recent studies have attempted to establish attribution with the limited set of information of the APT groups. Various government agencies and SOC vendors have utilized Indicators of Compromise (IoC) and Tactic, Technique, Procedures (TTPs) to collect intelligence pertaining to the adversaries, to no avail. Recently, MITRE’s ATT&CK® framework has been widely adopted for collecting and documenting the TTPs of the various CTAs. This paper presents an Automated Reclassification for Threat Actors (ART) that quantitatively compares the TTPs from different APT groups. ART crawls cyber threat reports and retrieves the ATT&CK matrix of APT groups. Then, it vectorizes the ATT&CK matrix and calculates the cosine similarity. By reexamining the various aliases of the CTAs with the ATT&CK framework, we believe that ART can help classify the indiscriminately established APT groups."

9448668,5G-enabled Road Safety and Cybersecurity Services for Connected and Automated Vehicles,"Advanced digital services, providing extensive information on road, weather and traffic conditions and enabled via 5G and other types of vehicular connectivity, can allow both human drivers and automated vehicles to manage better under challenging conditions; thus, improving road safety. The services can also enable better and more cost-efficient maintenance of the roads. This paper studies four different connected and automated vehicle (CAV) use cases, aiming at improving safety of the roads by utilizing cutting-edge communication, IoT, sensor fusion and cybersecurity technologies. The first pass analysis of the use cases and underlying architecture, conducted in the paper, will be extended towards real pilots and testing in future work."
9631991,Deep Reinforcement Learning For Online Distribution Power System Cybersecurity Protection,"The sophistication and regularity of power system cybersecurity attacks has been growing in the last decade, leading researchers to investigate new innovative, cyber-resilient tools to help grid operators defend their networks and power systems. One promising approach is to apply recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to aid grid operators in making real-time changes to the power system equipment to counteract malicious actions. While multiple transmission studies have been conducted in the past, in this work we investigate the possibility of defending distribution power systems using a DRL agent who has control of a collection of utility-owned distributed energy resources (DER). A game board using a modified version of the IEEE 13-bus model was simulated using OpenDSS to train the DRL agent and compare its performance to a random agent, a greedy agent, and human players. Both the DRL agent and the greedy approach performed well, suggesting a greedy approach can be appropriate for computationally tractable system configurations and a DRL agent is a viable path forward for systems of increased complexity.

8756901,Cyber-Physical Battlefield Platform for Large-Scale Cybersecurity Exercises,"In this study, we propose a platform upon which a cyber security exercise environment can be built efficiently for national critical infrastructure protection, i.e. a cyber-physical battlefield (CPB), to simulate actual ICS/SCADA systems in operation. Among various design considerations, this paper mainly discusses scalability, mobility, reality, extensibility, consideration of the domain or vendor specificities, and the visualization of physical facilities and their damage as caused by cyber attacks. The main purpose of the study was to develop a platform that can maximize the coverage that encompasses such design considerations. We discuss the construction of the platform through the final design choices. The features of the platform that we attempt to achieve are closely related to the target cyber exercise format. Design choices were made considering the construction of a realistic ICS/SCADA exercise environment that meets the goals and matches the characteristics of the Cyber Conflict Exercise (CCE), an annual national exercise organized by the National Security Research Institute (NSR) of South Korea. CCE is a real-time attack-defense battlefield drill between 10 red teams who try to penetrate a multi-level organization network and 16 blue teams who try to defend the network. The exercise platform provides scalability and a significant degree of freedom in the design of a very large-scale CCE environment. It also allowed us to fuse techniques such as 3D-printing and augmented reality (AR) to achieve the exercise goals. This CPB platform can also be utilized in various ways for different types of cybersecurity exercise. The successful application of this platform in Locked Shields 2018 (LS18) is strong evidence of this; it showed the great potential of this platform to integrate high-level strategic or operational exercises effectively with low-level technical exercises. This paper also discusses several possible improvements of the platform which could be made...

9296264,On Identifying Threats and Quantifying Cybersecurity Risks of Mnos Deploying Heterogeneous Rats,"Wireless networks constitute a significant attack vector for adversaries due to their wide usage in our everyday life. As the fifth generation of wireless networks reaches maturity, several vulnerabilities affecting earlier generations have been resolved. Nevertheless the coexistence of legacy wireless technologies is giving rise to the risk of allowing adversaries to perform downgrade attacks, thus bypassing the improved security of the state-of-the-art communication networks. Vulnerabilities due to the trade-off between security and usability could also exist in the latest wireless networking technologies; hence mobile network operators need to be aware of the risks related to both protocol vulnerabilities and configuration defects. This paper proposes a methodology for the systematic identification of vulnerabilities associated with wireless access protocols and systems and the quantitative evaluation of the resulting risks for mobile operators using attack trees, while considering the current legislative frameworks. The proposed methodology has been designed to aid both, mobile operators towards planning more effective cybersecurity strategies and adopting efficient defences to minimise the probability of an attack and predict its impact on the operational, market and business aspects of mobile network operators. The proposed risk assessment analysis is evaluated over three distinct vertical scenarios, namely an emergency call, a high-speed train commute and a massive public event, with the most relevant threats and their impact being measured and discussed. The evaluation of the model revealed significant results for mobile network operators that are deploying a mix of legacy and state of the art cellular technologies."
9122502,Cybersecurity Attacks in Vehicular Sensors,"Today's modern vehicles contain anywhere from sixty to one-hundred sensors and exhibit the characteristics of Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS). There is a high degree of coupling, cohesiveness, and interactions among vehicle's CPS components (e.g., sensors, devices, systems, systems-of-systems) across sensing, communication, and control layers. Cyber-attacks in the sensing or communication layers can compromise the security of the control layer. This paper provides a detailed review of potential cyber threats related to the sensing layer. Notably, the focus is mainly towards two categories of sensors: vehicle dynamics sensors (e.g., Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS), magnetic encoders, and inertial sensors) and environment sensors (e.g., Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), ultrasonic, camera, Radio Detection and Ranging (Radar) systems, and Global Positioning System (GPS) units). The paper also offers perspectives through existing countermeasures from literature and stresses the need for data-driven cybersecurity solutions."
9432668,Game Theoretical Model for Cybersecurity Risk Assessment of Industrial Control Systems,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Distributed Control Systems (DCS) use advanced computing, sensors, control systems, and communication networks to monitor and control industrial processes and distributed assets. The increased connectivity of these systems to corporate networks has exposed them to new security threats and made them a prime target for cyber-attacks with the potential of causing catastrophic economic, social, and environmental damage. Recent intensified sophisticated attacks on these systems have stressed the importance of methodologies and tools to assess the security risks of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). In this paper, we propose a novel game theory model and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the cybersecurity risks of an exemplary industrial control system under realistic assumptions. We present five game enrollments where attacker and defender agents make different preferences and we analyze the final outcome of the game. Results show that a balanced defense with uniform budget spending is the best strategy against a look-ahead attacker."

9253137,Applications of AI in cybersecurity,"Issues related to digital security are, there is no doubt for this, of utmost importance in the development of methods and support measures for organisations to successfully prepare for as well as realise their digital transformation. While big organisations and businesses may afford to buy services or develop their own in-house know-how and tools, small and medium-sized businesses are not having the means for this, be them financial resources, human resources or technology itself. This dystopic situation may on the other hand offer an unexpected and - as of today - yet unprecedented chance for innovations in terms of bridging the gap and addressing the need with use of AI technologies and services.

We show that the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and propose two algorithms - one for solving a convex relaxation, and the other for finding a local minimizer, based on a reduced gradient method. Also, we provide a sufficient condition under which the convex relaxation is exact and its solution coincides with that of the original problem. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."
9020811,AI and Game Theory based Autonomous UAV Swarm for Cybersecurity,"Uninterrupted communication is crucial for modern electromagnetic (EM) spectrum operations where successes of situational awareness, defensive and offensive missions necessitate continuous reliance on wireless transmission. Preventing an adversary from dominating cyberspace becomes challenging as rapid technological developments allow state and non-state actors to engage in a broad range of destructive cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA). Digital threats to communication networks can range from eavesdropping and impersonation attempts to various forms of denial-of-service attacks. In this paper, we present bio-inspired and game theory based flight control algorithms for a swarm of autonomous UAVs. Each UAV considers MANET connectivity, overshadowed ground area coverage and signal strength from interfering mobile radio emitters. Our algorithms use 3D Voronoi tessellations and linear interpolation for EM mapping of local neighborhood as part of decision making process. Simulation experiments in OPNET show that autonomous UAVS require only limited near neighbor communications to maintain a high area coverage overshadowed by the swarm with uninterrupted MANET connectivity. By providing a lightweight solution for rapidly deployable swarm of autonomous UAVS, our flight control algorithms are good candidates for deployment in complex environments in presence of adaptive and mobile sources of EM interference."
9639278,Casting a Wide Net: An Internet of Things Testbed for Cybersecurity Education and Research,"The last few years have seen an explosive growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) as billions of new low-powered devices are connected to the network in every sector, from household items to sensors, healthcare devices, and industrial controls. Devices often rely on vertical architectures, with each type of device requiring a separate platform for control, data sharing, and storage. New horizontal architectures are needed to allow sharing of resources between devices to optimize hardware efficiency. In addition, new networking paradigms such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) are required to efficiently manage increased delay-sensitive network demand. This broad range of new technologies and skills make entry difficult for students and new researchers, and innovative practical testbeds for IoT systems and SDN will be required for training and research. We propose an IoT testbed with multiple networking layers and heterogeneous devices to simultaneously support networking research, anomaly detection, and security principles applied specifically to IoT for education and research, providing a complex yet practical hands-on environment made entirely of open-source tools and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) materials that can be replicated for use by others seeking to build such a system."

Using linear transfer functions, a zero-dynamics attack was designed to be injected into the system. To further explore how zero-dynamics translates from linear to non-linear systems, a similar attack was made using a random value rather than an unstable zero of the system. These attacks were then injected via the ground station computer. An offline artificial immune system was created and used to test the effectiveness of detecting the attacks. The immune system uses a discrete, binary, non-self recognition algorithm to create detectors and find disturbances in the data."
8756252,Analysis of Botnet Domain Names for IoT Cybersecurity,"Botnets are widespread nowadays with the expansion of the Internet and commonly occur in many cyber-attacks, resulting in serious threats to network services and users' properties. With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the botnet can easily make use of IoT devices for larger-scale attacks. Domain name system (DNS) is widely used by the botnet to establish the connection between bots and their corresponding command-and-control (C&C). In order to avoid the track of the C&C through the DNS information, some sophisticated schemes are used by the botnet and fast-flux is a typical one. In this paper, the activities of Rustock botnet domain names which just use the fast-flux as the connection method between bots and C&C, are deeply analyzed from multiple aspects. Besides, we extract 32 special features of Rustock domain named querying traffic. Then multiple popular classifiers are adopted in order to pick the malicious domain names out from the DNS traffic using those 32 features. The work of this paper aims to provide guidance for future botnet detection based on real statics and experiments."
9559450,5G and beyond telco cloud: architecture and cybersecurity challenges,"The continuous improvements in network softwarization and cloudification have enabled the realization of many applications. One significant result from this is the harmonized amalgamation of NFV, SDN, and Cloud Computing to bring telco clouds that efficiently operate in a 5G network. Although these building blocks have revolutionized the telecom sector in various ways, they are vulnerable to multiple security issues. Moreover, the absence of a generic architecture is another challenge that hinders the effective adoption of the technology. Consequently, in this paper, we have studied the designs proposed by various telco cloud providers and suggested a generic telco cloud architecture to serve as a reference for further study. In addition, we have also summarized vital security threats that can expose telco clouds to numerous attacks."
7968482,Big Data for Cybersecurity: Vulnerability Disclosure Trends and Dependencies,"Complex Big Data systems in modern organisations are progressively becoming attack targets by existing and emerging threat agents. Elaborate and specialised attacks will increasingly be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses. With the ever-increasing trend of cybercrime and incidents due to these vulnerabilities, effective vulnerability management is imperative for modern organisations regardless of their size. However, organisations struggle to manage the sheer volume of vulnerabilities discovered on their networks. Moreover, vulnerability management tends to be more reactive in practice. Rigorous statistical models, simulating anticipated volume and dependence of vulnerability disclosures, will undoubtedly provide important insights to organisations and help them become more proactive in the management of cyber risks. By leveraging the rich yet complex historical vulnerability data, our proposed novel and rigorous framework has enabled this new capability. By utilising this sound framework, we initiated an important study on not only handling persistent volatilities in the data but also further unveiling multivariate dependence structure amongst different vulnerability risks. In sharp contrast to the existing studies on univariate time series, we consider the more general multivariate case striving to capture their intriguing relationships. Through our extensive empirical studies using the real world vulnerability data, we have shown that a composite model can effectively capture and preserve long-term dependency between different vulnerability and exploit disclosures. In addition, the paper paves the way for further study on the stochastic perspective of vulnerability proliferation towards building more accurate measures for better cyber risk management as a whole."

These bugs could allow an attacker to take over an application and steal information. One of the ways to address this issue is by means of awareness training. The Sifu platform was developed in the industry, for the industry, with the aim to raise software developers' awareness of secure coding. This paper extends the Sifu platform with three challenges that specifically address embedded programming courses, and describes how to implement these challenges, while also evaluating the usefulness of these challenges to raise security awareness in an academic setting. Our work presents technical details on the detection mechanisms for software vulnerabilities and gives practical advice on how to implement them. The evaluation of the challenges is performed through two trial runs with a total of 16 participants. Our preliminary results show that the challenges are suitable for academia, and can even potentially be included in official teaching curricula. One major finding is an indicator of the lack of awareness of secure coding by undergraduates. Finally, we compare our results with previous work done in the industry and extract advice for practitioners."

8725596,Cybersecurity Enhancement of Power Trading Within the Networked Microgrids Based on Blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph Approach,"Power grid resilience, reliability, and sustainability can be improved significantly by decomposing the large grids into networked microgrids (NMGs). However, the optimal energy management problem and preserving the security in NMGs are more complicated and challenging. This paper aims to propose a secured stochastic energy management framework for NMGs based on the modified blockchain approach, utilizing the directed acyclic graph (DAG). Using the decentralized and transparent blockchain technology will help to have higher security and lower risks within the network, thus eliminating the financial fraud and cutting down the total operational cost. In order to address the issues arising in the traditional blockchain models, mainly due to the storage and high complexities of hash address calculations, this paper proposes a new modified blockchain technology based on the DAG method. Also, a novel data restoration technique is developed to provide a way to restore the data with appropriate accuracy. The unscented transform (UT) approach is employed to model the uncertainties of forecast error in hourly load demand, solar power output, and wind turbines power output. Finally, the proposed model is tested on an NMG system with four MGs, including two residential MGs (as the noncrucial loads), a commercial MG (as the intermediate level loads), and a hospital MG (as the crucial loads)."

The adverse scenarios arising due to cyberattacks are carefully reviewed in this study, which includes (a) interfering with the main charger controller (FPGA) logic and its data, (b) establishing fake communication between the charging controller and other electronic control units (ECUs) connected over same controller area network (CAN) bus, and (c) interfering with the battery management system functionalities. A 6.6kW interleaved totem-pole PFC front-end followed by a high frequency DC-DC converter is used as our OBC representative system in this analysis. Possibilities and ways of potential cyberattacks on this model are investigated in detail. Effort is made towards providing software as well as hardware design-level protection mechanisms to mitigate the malicious effects of such cyberattacks on the OBC hardware. This system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the fault occurrences under various data integrity attacks as well as to validate the effectiveness of our proposed countermeasure approaches.

8438948,A Risk-Based Dynamic Decision-Making Approach for Cybersecurity Protection in Industrial Control Systems,"Decision-making is a key component of industrial control system (ICS) security. However, due to the stability and real-time requirements of ICSs, current decision-making approaches typically designed for IT systems are not entirely suitable for ICSs. In this paper, with consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a risk-based multistep dynamic decision-making approach for protecting ICSs is proposed. Following this proposal, multiple models, including multilayer Bayesian network, process model, and attack-defense strategy model are built first. On this basis, a state controller is designed to ensure the safe degradation/upgradation of ICSs. Finally, a game theory-based optimal defense strategy generation approach is presented. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation on a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that the proposed dynamic decision-making approach has the ability to generate the optimal defense strategy to minimize system loss."

With the increasing popularity of blockchain in various fields of applications, it is extremely necessary to promote classified protection for blockchain's risk assessment in order to push forward the sustainable development of blockchain. Taking the Level 3 in Chinese classified protection 2.0 as an example, this paper proposes the common evaluation rules on blockchain to ensure that blockchain can meet the needs of countries to build it as critical infrastructure. Both assessment requirements and enforcement proposals are presented and analyzed from the standpoint of blockchain's core technologies, e.g., peer-to-peer network, distributed ledger, contract's scripting system, and consensus mechanism. Moreover, the assessment results on three main platforms, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger, are summarized and analyzed in compliance with the control points specified in the level 3. Our investigation indicates that the current blockchain is able to satisfy the requirements of evaluation items in many aspects, such as software fault tolerance, resource control, backup and recovery, but further improvements are still needed for some aspects, including security audit, access control, identification and authentication, data integrity, etc., in order to satisfy the requirements of important fields on national security, economic development and human life."

9199295,Decentralized Consensus Decision-Making for Cybersecurity Protection in Multimicrogrid Systems,"Multimicrogrid (MMG) systems play an increasingly important role in the smart grid. They come with various potential cyberattacks, which may cause power supply interruption or even human casualties. Therefore, decision-making for timely mitigation of cyberattack risks is highly desirable in the security protection of power systems. However, there is a lack of effective decentralized decision-making strategies that are able to deal with MMG scenarios through distributed consensus. To address this issue, a decentralized consensus decision-making (DCDM) approach is proposed in this article for the security of MMG systems. It achieves decentralized consensus without the need of a trusted authority or central server, making it distinct from existing consensus methods. Meanwhile, it guarantees the consistency and nonrepudiability of consensus results, which are stored on the blockchain in sequence. In each of the distributed agents, the approach consists of a fuzzy static Bayesian game model (FSB-GM) to determine the optimal security strategy and a hybrid consensus algorithm to achieve consensus. The FSB-GM considers the fuzzy preferences of different types of attackers and defenders. The hybrid consensus algorithm is implemented by the fusion improvement of two consensus mechanisms in the blockchain. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through a case study on an MMG system."

9032978,Cybersecurity Analytics using Smart Inverters in Power Distribution System: Proactive Intrusion Detection and Corrective Control Framework,"Power grids with increasing number of distributed energy resources (DERs) equipped with fleet of smart devices are exposed to malicious attacks. These malicious actions can ultimately cause a large-scale blackout if these subversive activities are not prevented, detected, or promptly addressed. Power grids are being threatened by a category of cyber-physical attacks, which target both the physical and cyber layers of the system. This paper proposes an autonomous detection and corrective control framework consisting of two algorithms to identify anomalies and provide a corrective action on the distribution system using smart inverters. The proposed framework detects the inverter abnormal behaviors and identifies them as cyber-physical attack or internal failure of the inverter. A model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed to detect the inverter internal failure. In the case of inverter failure, the proposed MPC scheme adopts corrective actions to restore the inverter operation with a pre-defined power injection set-points. Additionally, this paper proposes a cyber-physical attack detection mechanism, based on measurements from a geographic community of smart devices. The proposed framework continuously assists the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to differentiate anomalies on the distribution system and decide the appropriate control actions for the entire grid."

While many manufacturers are working on solving PHD connectivity with proprietary solutions, theree is a lack of a standardized approach to providing secure Plug & Play interoperability.
Purpose:
The purpose of this Standards Roadmap is to build common ground around cybersecurity in the PHD data exchange and define an “information security toolbox” appropriate for the PHD data exchange standards. The Standards Roadmap will become the basis for the standardization of secure Plug & Play interoperability in an open consensus standard by the IEEE 11073 PHD Working Group and secure Profile and Service by the Bluetooth SIG Medical Devices Working Group."
9009588,"An interdisciplinary approach for security, privacy and trust in the electronic medical record : A pragmatic legal perspective","The use of electronic medical records in healthcare institutions is becoming more widespread, bringing benefits in terms of quality, security and efficiency of patient care. The development of e-health, i.e. the integrated use of information and communication technologies and services, is considered a performance factor in medicine. The purpose of this article is to identify the key success factors of cybersecurity for e-health and to demonstrate that the effectiveness of cybersecurity depends on the complementarity of organizational, managerial, human, legal and technical measures. Technical innovation alone cannot meet the requirements of security and trust. The latter must be achieved through organizational policies that take into account the needs of each party. Our research was conducted from a European perspective and focused on Swiss university hospitals and the laws applicable to them. Since the issues are similar everywhere, however, the recommendations are generic, global and effective in different countries."
9458107,Quantitatively Examining Service Requests of a Cloud-Based On-Demand Cybersecurity Service Solution for Small Businesses,"With the rise of cybercrimes, limited by the funding and in-house technical resource, the small business sector is already known for struggling with cybersecurity-related issues. Regardless of 65% acknowledging they have been the target of a cyberattack and 86% believing digital risk will upsurge, only 4% of small and medium-sized business owners have executed all of the U.S. Small Business Administration's cybersecurity best practices, rendering to a survey by Nationwide [1]. To meet this challenge, we have proposed a cloud-based on-demand cybersecurity service solution for small businesses (CODCSSSB) to provide a cost-effective cybersecurity resolution for small businesses. This paper has explored how to apply a quantitative examination approach to validate the security service requests sent to and processed by the CODCSSSB to discover the weakness of design with low cost in terms of the time of development and accuracy of identifying the root cause of the design issues."
9732568,Bird's-eye view on the Automotive Cybersecurity Landscape & Challenges in adopting AI/ML,"The integration of intelligent functionalities in con-nected and autonomous automotive system has great potential to deliver personalised user experience and improve traffic manage-ment. It can benefit the society by improving highway capacity and safety of road users. The adoption of data-driven Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models in the automotive sector is opening venues to new services and business models such as autonomous fleet management, self-driving trucks, robo-taxi etc. However, where the sharing of mix-critical data brings opportunities, it simultaneously presents serious cybersecurity and functional safety risks. In recent years, the cyber attacks have impacted every segment of automotive system including electronic control unit, infotainment, communications, firmware, mobile apps etc. This adoption of AI and ML as enabling technology for next-generation autonomous transportation systems is going to significantly widen the automotive attack surface. This trend has increasing tendency of exposing both vehicle and road -side infrastructure to a wide range of sophisticated cyber attacks. This paper aims to review and build a body of knowledge on the topic of automotive cybersecurity, by bridging a domain-specific knowledge gap among automotive system designers, engineers and system security architects. For this purpose, it discuss the autonomous driving system data processing pipeline and threat analysis and risk assessment process of automotive cybersecurity standard ISO/SAE 21434 to harness and harden automotive cybersecurity. It highlights automotive system architectural and ecosystem challenges in adopting AI and ML driven decision making."
9637252,Reinforcing Cybersecurity Hands-on Training With Adaptive Learning,"This Research To Practice Full Paper presents how learning experience influences students' capability to learn and their motivation for further learning. Although each student is different, standard instruction methods do not adapt to individual students. Adaptive learning reverses this practice and attempts to improve the student experience. While adaptive learning is well-established in programming, it is rarely used in cybersecurity education. This paper is one of the first works investigating adaptive learning in cybersecurity training. First, we analyze the performance of 95 students in 12 training sessions to understand the limitations of the current training practice. Less than half of the students (45 out of 95) completed the training without displaying any solution, and only in two sessions, all students completed all phases. Then, we simulate how students would proceed in one of the past training sessions if it would offer more paths of various difficulty. Based on this simulation, we propose a novel tutor model for adaptive training, which considers students' proficiency before and during an ongoing training session. The proficiency is assessed using a pre-training questionnaire and various in-training metrics. Finally, we conduct a case study with 24 students and new training using the proposed tutor model and adaptive training format. The results show that the adaptive training does not overwhelm students as the original static training format. In particular, adaptive training enables students to enter several alternative training phases with lower difficulty than the phases in the original training. The proposed adaptive format is not restricted to particular training used in our case study. Therefore, it can be applied to practicing any cybersecurity topic or even in other related computing fields, such as networking or operating systems. Our study indicates that adaptive learning is a promising approach for improving the student experience in cyberse...

9647807,Using CGAN to Deal with Class Imbalance and Small Sample Size in Cybersecurity Problems,"Predictive modelling in cybersecurity domains usually involves dealing with complex settings. The class imbalance problem is a well-know challenge typically present in the cybersecurity domain. For instance, in a real-world intrusion detection scenario, the number of attacks is expected to be a a very small percentage of the normal cases. Moreover, in these applications, the number of available examples labelled is also small due to the complexity and cost of the labelling process: teams of domain experts need to be involved in the process which becomes expensive, time consuming and prone to errors. To address these problems is critical to the success of predictive modelling in cybersecurity applications. In this paper we tackle the class imbalance and small sample size through the use of a CGAN-based up-sampling procedure. We carry out an extensive set of experiments that show the positive impact of applying this solution to address the class imbalance and small sample size problems. A large data repository is built and freely provided to the research community containing 114 binary datasets based on real-world cybersecurity problems that are generated with diversified levels of imbalance and sample size. Our experiments show a clear advantage of using the CGAN-based up-sampling method specially for situations where the sample size is small and there is a large imbalance between the problem classes. In the most critical scenarios associated with extreme rarity and very small sample size, an impressive performance boost is achieved. We also explore the behaviour of this approach when the presence of these problems is less marked and we found that, while CGAN-based up-sampling is not able to further improve the minority class performance, it also has no negative impact. Thus, it is a safe to use solution, also in these scenarios."
9653194,Cybersecurity Practices At The Initial Stages Of The Software Engineering Process,"Software Engineering is a foundation of modern computer systems development. The process involves several steps, including Analysis and Design, which are the fundamentals for building software systems. This discipline is offered by several university degrees these days around the world, included among other computer science courses.Nowadays, cybersecurity problems are very related with software weakness or bad designs, as an example one can mention bad implementations, projects with poor quality, lack of testing, among others issues. Overall one bigger problem is the lack of security integration from the inception and designing of the software project.Cybersecurity had gained a lot of attention in recent years. From the everyday desktop software been abused and exploited, such as browser exploits and Windows RDP protocol exploits, to abusing the Internet of Things to create massive botnets capable to disrupt the Internet service, as such as the Mirai attack in 2017.We believe that if security played a basic role from the inception of the software project, a lot of these incidents could be prevented. We previously proposed to introduce cybersecurity basics in the software engineering courses to raise awareness of these problems to future professional software engineers. In this paper, we focus on the first steps of software engineering and how cybersecurity should be embedded as good practices for every student in any given software project."

9463910,Embracing Risk: Cyber Insurance as an Incentive Mechanism for Cybersecurity,"act:
This book provides an introduction to the theory and practice of cyber insurance. Insurance as an economic instrument designed for risk management through risk spreading has existed for centuries. Cyber insurance is one of the newest sub-categories of this old instrument. It emerged in the 1990s in response to an increasing impact that information security started to have on business operations. For much of its existence, the practice of cyber insurance has been on how to obtain accurate actuarial information to inform specifics of a cyber insurance contract. As the cybersecurity threat landscape continues to bring about novel forms of attacks and losses, ransomware insurance being the latest example, the insurance practice is also evolving in terms of what types of losses are covered, what are excluded, and how cyber insurance intersects with traditional casualty and property insurance. The central focus, however, has continued to be risk management through risk transfer, the key functionality of insurance.
The goal of this book is to shift the focus from this conventional view of using insurance as primarily a risk management mechanism to one of risk control and reduction by looking for ways to re-align the incentives. On this front we have encouraging results that suggest the validity of using insurance as an effective economic and incentive tool to control cyber risk. This book is intended for someone interested in obtaining a quantitative understanding of cyber insurance and how innovation is possible around this centuries-old financial instrument."
9071014,Review and Analysis of Cowrie Artefacts and Their Potential to be Used Deceptively,"Honeypots are progressively becoming a fundamental cybersecurity tool to detect, prevent and record new threats and attack methodologies used by attackers to penetrate systems. The current technology is advancing rapidly; with the use of virtualisation, and most recently, virtual containers, the deployment of honeypots has become increasingly easier. A varied collection of open source honeypots such as Cowrie are available today, which can be easily downloaded and deployed within minutes-with default settings. Cowrie is a medium-interaction secure shell (SSH) and Telnet honeypot intended to log brute force and shell interaction attacks. However, the current issue with the default Cowrie configuration is that it is easily detected by adversaries using automated scripts and tools. To increase Cowrie's deceptive capabilities, it is essential to understand, modify, and leverage all capabilities of the honeypot. However, this process is complex, because there are no standard frameworks to interpret the artefacts used by the Cowrie honeypot and how these artefacts link to the type of deceptiveness presented to the cyber-attacker. Therefore, there is a need for some type of infrastructure that can interpret these basic deception techniques and tools, and later developing them into feasible cybersecurity defence mechanisms. This study pursues to develop an understanding about its capabilities, and how these capabilities can be used to bait attackers. The resulting annotations can help cybersecurity defenders better understand the effectiveness of the Cowrie artefacts and how they can be used deceptively."
9155945,A Model-Based Security Testing Approach for Automotive Over-The-Air Updates,"Modern connected cars are exposed to various cybersecurity threats due to the sophisticated computing and connectivity technologies they host for providing enhanced user experience for their occupants by offering numerous innovative applications. While prior studies exist that explore cybersecurity challenges, tools and techniques for automotive systems, over-the-air (OTA) software updates for automobiles can be exploited by the attackers to compromise vehicle security and safety has not been covered extensively. This paper presents our Model-Based Security Testing (MBST) approach, designed for cybersecurity evaluation of the OTA update system for automobiles, which has an integrated testbed and a software tool that is capable of automatically generating and executing test cases by using attack trees as an input. Integrating threat modelling in the testing provides several benefits, including clear and systematic identification of different threats. Automation of the test-case generation and execution has the obvious benefits of saving time and manual effort, as manual test-case generation is both a time-consuming and error-prone process (especially, when the testing involves several test-cases). A simple simulated attack is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our testing approach. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior research that uses a testing approach similar to our approach for automotive OTA security evaluation."

9197975,A Proposed Framework for Controlling Cyber- Crime,"The usage of the internet as part of our daily routine has brought many advantages and has also facilitated our lifestyle, the activities that required hours or days to be solved like sending a message to a far person has been reduced to a short time. The Internet has not only brought advantages to our community but also disadvantages, among the drawbacks of the internet we have cyber-crime activity. Cyber-crime activity is one of the biggest challenges that the world is facing. It is the concern of everyone as the main goal is to bring cybersecurity to reduce the number of losses that the crime generates across the globe. Cybercrime is happening every second anywhere, and it is causing much damage not only in terms of data or privacy breaches but financially also. Many countries are lacking an excellent policy to tackle cybercrime, and for that reason, the number of crimes is increasing day by day. As much as the number of crimes is increasing, likewise, the number of financial losses is also increasing. In this paper, we proposed a framework that will help us fight against cybercrime regardless of the place we are located by monitoring the activities done on our electronic devices."
9251141,Comparative Analysis of Cyber Resilience Strategy in Asia-Pacific Countries,"Cyber resilience, the ability for positive adaptation in the face of adverse cyber events, is seen as an evolution in the cybersecurity posture of organizations and countries. It represents a mindset shift from protection and avoidance of adverse cyber events and the development of fail-safe systems to anticipation and planning for adverse cyber events, including the development of systems that are safe-to-fail. At the national level, the adoption and incorporation of resilience thinking in the national cybersecurity strategies is given impetus by several factors, including the inevitability of both known and unknown cyber risks, as well as the demands for holistic resilience from multilateral frameworks, including the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development agenda, the New Urban Agenda, and the Sendai framework. This paper presents findings from a review of the national cybersecurity strategies of several countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The review is framed along several lines of inquiry that explore the extent to which the countries incorporate whole-of-society cyber resilience in their national cybersecurity strategies. While most countries give recognition of the importance of cyber resilience, few countries provide a detailed operationalization of cyber resilience in their strategies. Not surprisingly, the pattern, that countries with higher cybersecurity maturity have a more nuanced articulation of cyber resilience, is noted from the review. However, some countries with lower cybersecurity maturity are noted to provide more apparent avenues for the engagement of civil society stakeholders, including third-sector organizations, in the cybersecurity strategies."
9005713,Experiential Learning: Case Study-Based Portable Hands-on Regression Labware for Cyber Fraud Prediction,"Machine Learning (ML) analyzes, and processes data and discover patterns.

9709804,GDL90fuzz: Fuzzing - GDL-90 Data Interface Specification Within Aviation Software and Avionics Devices–A Cybersecurity Pentesting Perspective,"As the core technology of next-generation air transportation systems, the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is becoming very popular. However, many (if not most) ADS-B devices and implementations support and rely on Garmin’s Datalink 90 (GDL-90) protocol for data exchange and encapsulation. This makes it essential to investigate the integrity of the GDL-90 protocol especially against attacks on the core subsystem availability, such as denial-of-service (DoS), which pose high risks to safety-critical and mission-critical systems such as in avionics and aerospace. In this paper, we consider GDL-90 protocol fuzzing options and demonstrate practical DoS attacks on popular electronic flight bag (EFB) software operating on mobile devices. Then we present our own specially configured avionics pentesting platform and the GDL-90 protocol. We captured legitimate traffic from ADS-B avionics devices. We ran our samples through the state-of-the-art fuzzing platform American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) and fed the AFL’s output to EFB apps and the GDL-90 decoding software via the network in the same manner as legitimate GDL-90 traffic would be sent from ADS-B and other avionics devices. The results showed worrying and critical lack of security in many EFB applications where the security is directly related to the aircraft’s safe navigation. Out of the 16 tested configurations, our avionics pentesting platform managed to crash or otherwise impact 9 (56%). The observed problems manifested as crashes, hangs, and abnormal behaviors of the EFB apps and GDL-90 decoders during the fuzzing test. Our developed and proposed systematic pentesting methodology for avionics devices, protocols, and software can be used to discover and report vulnerabilities as early as possible."
9231229,A Survey on Cybersecurity Challenges and Awareness for Children of all Ages,"Children are considered an easy prey to many cybersecurity threats. This is due to the lack of awareness of such threats while using smart devices, like smartphones. In most of the cases, not only children but their parents are also unaware of these security threats. Therefore, in this research, we have performed a comprehensive survey on various aspects of cybersecurity threats and its awareness among children. Such as, online safety and security for children, security control challenges and cybersecurity challenges for children and parents. We have also performed a security test to demonstrate the effectiveness of built-in security and privacy settings of such devices. For this purpose, we have used the built-in security and privacy settings of an iPhone 11 and performed various usage tests on unrestricted and restricted mode. The tests and observations have proved that the built-in security and privacy controls, such as Screen Time or Parental Controls, are the most effective way to safeguard children from various Cybersecurity threats they may face during their use of such devices and lack of cybersecurity awareness."
9213922,Cybersecurity of the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS),"In recent years, UASs have become more and more popular. There are many reasons for this; one of the most popular is the enhancement of drones' functionalities and improvement in battery life, stabilization, navigation, sensor technology, and much more. The growth is driven by many benefits. However, as the number of drones is expanding and levels of their technological functionalities evolving, the use of drones brings a lot of concerns as well as challenges that should not be underestimated. This refers to issues in the area of cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety. UASs, under the international, regional, and national regime of aviation law, are considered aircraft. Since there is no existing cybersecurity framework for UASs, the civil aviation cybersecurity framework should apply to their operations. This paper will focus on the potential cyber threats against UASs, providing some examples of cyberattacks from the past. Further, the overview of the aviation cybersecurity framework will follow in order to determine the current status of maturity at the international and regional (European Union) levels. The conclusion of the paper will identify the necessary steps to be taken and potential solutions in terms of applying the aviation cybersecurity framework into the operation of UASs."
9406348,Implementing Cybersecurity Best Practices for Electrical Infrastructure in a Refinery: A Case Study,"Cybersecurity is quickly becoming one of the most important and potentially impactful risks to a process or refining facility. Cybersecurity solutions for electrical infrastructure can be challenging to implement because of the large number of devices that utilize a single set of passwords. The potential solutions to mitigate these risks can be expensive, inefficient, and time consuming to maintain. This article describes a case study of developing and implementing cybersecurity best practices for electrical infrastructure at a refining facility using a low-cost and low-maintenance approach. The design approach for this case study employs a centralized solution to implement role-based user access control, automated device password management, and a centralized data aggregation and human-machine interface (HMI) platform. The development of the cybersecurity best practices, design and implementation of the automation and cybersecurity platform, operations and maintenance, and lessons learned are discussed."
9432948,Training a Quantum Annealing Based Restricted Boltzmann Machine on Cybersecurity Data,"A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative model that could be used in effectively balancing a cybersecurity dataset because the synthetic data a RBM generates follows the probability distribution of the training data. RBM training can be performed using contrastive divergence (CD) and quantum annealing (QA). QA-based RBM training is fundamentally different from CD and requires samples from a quantum computer. We present a real-world application that uses a quantum computer. Specifically, we train a RBM using QA for cybersecurity applications. The D-Wave 2000Q has been used to implement QA. RBMs are trained on the ISCX data, which is a benchmark dataset for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs are also trained using CD. CD is a commonly used method for RBM training. Our analysis of the ISCX data shows that the dataset is imbalanced. We present two different schemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it to a classifier. The first scheme is based on the undersampling of benign instances. The imbalanced training dataset is divided into five sub-datasets that are trained separately. A majority voting is then performed to get the result. Our results show the majority vote increases the classification accuracy up from 90.24% to 95.68%, in the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy increases from 74.14% to 80.04%. In the second scheme, a RBM is used to generate synthetic data to balance the training dataset. We show that both QA and CD-trained RBM can be used to generate useful synthetic data. Balanced training data is used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers investigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) perform better than other classifiers. They both show an accuracy of 93%. Our results show a proof-of-concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained on a 64-bit binary dataset. The illustrative example suggests the possibility to migrate many practical classification problems to QA-based techniques. ...

9655895,Determining Bring Your Own Device (Byod) Security Policy Compliance Among Malaysian Teleworkers: Perceived Cybersecurity Governance as Moderator,"Literature evidently shows that many organizations have enabled Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) for their employees as an immediate strategy to cushion the risks of disruption to their business operations. Though these types of environments were typically not designed to support an organization’s entire workforce, it certainly made the transition easier as BYOD policy offers organizational flexibility, efficiency, and collaboration in remote work-from-home cases. Although BYOD brings many benefits to organizations and employees, cybersecurity on one endpoint is a critical concern for organizations. Cyber intruders will capitalize on any cybersecurity vulnerabilities to steal valuable data. While organizations have established BYOD security policy as a basis, the issue is whether the teleworkers comply with it. Protection Motivation Theory is used to explain the action taken by teleworkers to protect themselves when under attack and how accounting teleworker’s behavior to avoid cyber threat. Intention compliance has been studied by many researchers and recently, there was a call from a researcher to study the actual compliance in ISSPs due to a gap between intention and actual compliance. Hence, ensuring BYOD security policy compliance is crucial among the teleworkers. This paper, supported by Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) in addressing gaps in the literature, presents a conceptual model that examines determinants of BYOD security policy compliance among Malaysian teleworkers. The role of the perceived cybersecurity governance is also incorporated to investigate its interplay with the determinants."

9685081,Sharing is Caring: Optimized Threat Visualization for a Cybersecurity Data Sharing Platform,"Cyberattacks are increasingly costing organizations billions of dollars annually. To protect against them, cybersecurity information sharing and cyberthreat visualization have become crucial research topics. Our platform, CYBersecurity information EXchange with Privacy (CYBEX-P), implements developments in both areas as an approachable collaborative security tool. CYBEX-P's threat-intelligence graph displays indicators of compromise and their crowd-reported threat levels. Intuitive and efficient data interaction is key for adoption of such a contributor-driven system and is the focus of this work. A user study was conducted with participants from cybersecurity backgrounds to test different visualization configurations. Measurements pertaining to dependent variables such as task accuracy and threat-detection time were recorded. Subsequent analysis revealed that relying on localized color to represent threat comes with serious limitations. Likewise, information density must be carefully considered. We conclude that the misuse of simple visual properties can lead to perilous reductions in accuracy and response-time and provide recommendations for avoiding these pitfalls."
9637180,Scalable Learning Environments for Teaching Cybersecurity Hands-on,"This Innovative Practice full paper describes a technical innovation for scalable teaching of cybersecurity hands-on classes using interactive learning environments. Hands-on experience significantly improves the practical skills of learners. However, the preparation and delivery of hands-on classes usually do not scale. Teaching even small groups of students requires a substantial effort to prepare the class environment and practical assignments. Further issues are associated with teaching large classes, providing feedback, and analyzing learning gains. We present our research effort and practical experience in designing and using learning environments that scale up hands-on cybersecurity classes. The environments support virtual networks with full-fledged operating systems and devices that emulate realworld systems. The classes are organized as simultaneous training sessions with cybersecurity assignments and learners' assessment. For big classes, with the goal of developing learners' skills and providing formative assessment, we run the environment locally, either in a computer lab or at learners' own desktops or laptops. For classes that exercise the developed skills and feature summative assessment, we use an on-premises cloud environment. Our approach is unique in supporting both types of deployment. The environment is described as code using open and standard formats, defining individual hosts and their networking, configuration of the hosts, and tasks that the students have to solve. The environment can be repeatedly created for different classes on a massive scale or for each student on-demand. Moreover, the approach enables learning analytics and educational data mining of learners' interactions with the environment. These analyses inform the instructor about the student's progress during the class and enable the learner to reflect on a finished training. Thanks to this, we can improve the student class experience and motivation for further learning. Using...

This chapter provides the information on assessing current vulnerability management processes. A bug bounty program manager should be whoever does the day‐to‐day work in coordinated application or web application security measures. The most difficult part of the entire process of executing a bug bounty program for an enterprise is evaluating the risk and risk mitigation programs. Risk analysis requires visualizing how all of the parts of a security team come together, and rationally determining how it plays into application security. Secure coding platforms such as checkmarx codebashing and security awareness incentives such as hacking demos, security riddles, and other fun educational events can help break down any barriers that may exist between application security and software engineering. Application security managers should attempt to build rapport with the legal department immediately. Bug bounty programs are an amazing security tool. A good program can provide valuable insight and help enterprises continuously test their assets."

The authors provide insights into deployment journeys, building real-time analytics capabilities, and using advanced threat analytics to understand adversaries’ objectives and TTPs. The chapter also uncovers typical attacks faced by cloud deployments in Indian geography and illustrates attacker profiles generated from over 60 days of deployment in exposed environment."
9635114,Understanding Safe Harbor and Service Level Agreements,"stract:
Safe harbors contain legal jargon and can seem intimidating, especially when it's the program's responsibility to at least work up a simple safe harbor clause. Most modern‐day bug bounty platforms allow a program manager to use a templated safe harbor agreement, and in all actuality that's all a safe harbor is: a templated nonaction clause. Program managers need to heed the safe harbor recommendation. Attack patterns can be analyzed via security information and event management logs or the web application security firewall, and hopefully at this point a program has not been established without these key tools. A service level agreement is the enterprise's promise to a researcher to respond to or to fix the reported vulnerability in an adequate amount of time."

9635084,Expanding Scope,"stract:
The idea behind the expansions of scope of a bug bounty program is to give researchers more surface to test on. The nonnegotiable aspect of scope expansion is adequately portraying intentions to the team. Before expanding, it's absolutely essential to evaluate the current bounty pool and analyze the trends of payouts over the course of the period to attempt to get a rough estimate of what the expansion may do to the budget. Ideally, scope expansions are best approached when there is adequate reason to believe that the current scope is either too limited or exhausted in one way or another. Scope expansions aren't the only way to encourage more program participation. Program managers can alternatively invite more security researchers, with automated approaches and by hand. A program manager should not attempt to form any expansion processes until a baseline level of security is considered."
9514792,8 Use ModSecurity Web Application Firewall to Mitigate OWASP’s Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities,"stract:
In this era of globalization, web applications have become a core component for any organization to thrive and flourish. As the users of Internet increase, the attack on web applications has also increased. The web application firewall (WAF) is deployed to protect web applications and web services as it focuses on the 7th layer: the application layer of the OSI model. WAF acts a security tool which shields web applications and web application servers from Top 10 open web application security project (OWASP) attacks. When a web application is protected by WAF, WAFs act like a interface providing inclusive protection by validating every request with specified ‘Sec Rules.’WAFs protect against a number of application layer security threats which are usually not protected by numerous tools like intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS) and other categories of firewalls. As normal firewall installed for network layer protection and does not work for application layer security issues, this web applications can be easily attacked by hackers. In this chapter, we will discuss on how to set up and use ModSecurity WAF with Nginx (Dockerized) with log monitoring using Elastic Stack thus offering an additional layer of security."

9635063,Triage and Bug Management,"stract:
Triage is the act of reviewing vulnerabilities, and determining whether the report warrants further action within the intake process. The vulnerability validation process should be handled diligently with respect to the production environment, research authenticity, and program definitions. The triage evaluation stage is a perfect time to ask a researcher for more information. Bug bounty program managers must make use of additional information gathering where necessary. Managed services can even help reduce friction in the reporting process. The entire report management process can take quite a bit of preparation and understanding to turn a clunky process into a smooth workflow. The chapter presents some vulnerability examples. Vulnerabilities are accurately rated within the reporting processes. Understanding that the taxonomy and priority of vulnerability remediation may change/have to change is an essential part of program management."
9635065,Program Configuration,"stract:
This chapter aims to evaluate the options to adequately prepare program managers for a more successful setup. It presents the various options between Bugcrowd and HackerOne. The welcome center promotes all the various Bugcrowd documentation, including various videos to help program managers effectively run a bug bounty program. The program manager has the specific ability to drill down into more of the details of the focus areas, what assets are out of scope, and modify the safe harbor as they see fit. The chapter discusses the ability to discuss the specifics of rewards for in‐ and out‐of‐scope assets. A program manager has full transparency and control over the notifications that they will receive from the bug bounty program. Bugcrowd maintains a higher overall ease of access, setup, and program management segmentation, whereas HackerOne has more automation, filtering, and features for an exceedingly large program."

9635136,Vulnerability Disclosure Information,"stract:
Program managers will typically have the ability to allow security researchers to disclose their findings after the issues are fixed. Public disclosure, as it pertains to bug bounty platforms, is simply the act of allowing the report to populate via public feeds. The decision to allow public disclosure depends on the objective of the program. The control of vulnerability remediation transparency is up to the discretion of program managers. Public programs have the ability to fully commit to the most permissive state of programs: full disclosure. Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) were meant to be used as a way of standardizing vulnerabilities and disclosures, linking many databases together in an attempt to make it easier for enterprises to manage and patch newly identified vulnerabilities. Program managers should understand the various scenarios that can occur during the reporting process and realize that CVE management is dynamic."

9635071,Hacker and Program Interaction Essentials,"stract:
A program manager should never automatically assume that the hacker holds “x” intention. Some hackers are from countries where the value of the US dollar scales exceedingly well with their local currency. Bug bounty program managers should consider the possibility that the security researcher reporting the vulnerability could rely on it as their primary source of income, and treat all researchers as full‐time professionals. One of the most difficult aspects of managing bug bounty programs is the process of invalidating false positives. The chapter provides some general considerations when observing interactions between the bug bounty platform triage team and the security researcher. Toxic interactions may be hard to decipher from actual threats and, in the instance of a threat actor trying to exploit the enterprise, may lead to a lot of confusion."

With the growth in amount, variants, diversity, and sophistication in malware, conventional methods often fail to detect malicious applications. Therefore, fast and accurate detection of Android malware has become a real challenge. In this work, we build a lightweight malware detection model that is capable of fast, generalized, and accurate detection of Android malware. We design a framework that is built on static analysis approach integrated with highly effective feature engineering techniques resulting in a very lightweight model. We work with more than 0.8 million of samples which are collected between 2010 and 2019. To make our model more robust against variation of malware over time, we create multiple highly class-balanced datasets and perform parallel analysis.We extract several categories of information like permissions, API, intents, app components, etc., and demonstrate the effectiveness of feature selection techniques to analyze and identify the relevant features. These are the features that are the most informative and essential for samples gathered across different years to detect malware effectively. Finally, we present a model trained on 361 combined relevant sets of features which is capable of temporally robust detection of Android malware with 98.11% accuracy and 1.22% false positive rate (FPR). The tools that we use in our framework’s design show that the research community can build robust and effective android malware detection frameworks from scratch using the open-source tools and libraries, as mentioned in this chapter."
9514773,5 Collating Threat Intelligence for Zero Trust Future Using Open-Source Tools,"stract:
Organizations are taking the leap of faith with respect to digital adoption, oblivious to the perils of this journey. With the advancements in Big Data, it becomes vital to ensure that we are safeguarding our digital footprints. The ever-evolving IT landscape and the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) world makes it harder to be at the forefront and has shifted the focus to a perimeter-less architecture ensuring a Zero Trust Future. In recent times, there has been a growing interest in security and information protection for data across organizations. IT ecosystems encompass valuable data and resources that must be protected from attackers. Security experts often use honeypots and honeynets to protect network systems. Honeypot is an outstanding technology that security experts use to tap new hacking techniques from attackers and intruders. The project results show how open-source technologies can be used dynamically to add or modify hacking incidents in a research Honeynet system. The chapter outlines strategies for making honeypots more attractive for hackers to spend more time to provide hacking evidence. Threat intelligence is gathered to understand the emerging threat landscape and build resilience leading toward addressing threat and trust centric architecture for any enterprise. Additionally, this can be used for understanding the psyche of hackers to build intelligence to interpret threat behavior. Organizations with leaner budgets can build their strategy around these learnings for their first line of defense."
9635107,The Evolution of Bug Bounty Programs,"stract:
Understanding the evolution of bug bounty programs first requires familiarity with the hacking landscape, or as many in the information security field know it, penetration testing. This chapter describes some of the reasons a company may decide to ignore the idea of a bug bounty program: increased threat actor activity, security researchers scamming, applications being a small consideration, enormous budgetary requirements, and other security tooling as a priority. An enterprise may be fearful that establishing a bug bounty program will cause an increase of malicious threat actors attempting to hack into or successfully exploiting applications. Out of all of the other potential worries for setting up a program, security tooling is a legitimate concern. Even for the most technical of individuals, understanding the difference between a vulnerability disclosure program and a bug bounty program can be mind boggling."
9635081,Internal Assessments,"stract:
Program managers must understand why it's necessary to have a working understanding of penetration testing and the associated vulnerability assessment phases. This chapter introduces some useful crash‐course assessment concepts and tooling. Program managers should perform full internal assessments before opening the program, even to a small group of security researchers. One of the most important aspects of internal testing is to place oneself in the shoes of a threat actor. An active assessment is one in which a hacker tests for vulnerabilities. One of the best tools in a program manager's arsenal for testing URL parameters and finding hidden parameters is DalFox. Program managers should aspire to learn as much as possible to identify a wider range of bugs. For program managers that don't have the experience to perform internal assessments themselves, they should outsource to a trusted penetration testing firm and ask for a blackbox test."
9635079,Defining Program Scope and Bounties,"stract:
Bounty programs establish a way for a researcher to disclose bugs of impact to organizations. The enterprise has the ability to define various reward tiers to encourage participation. One of the biggest complaints that researchers will touch on is the lack of wildcards in a program. When thinking about wildcards, there are several methodologies: subdomain, domain, specific domain path, and subdomain path. Enterprise bug bounty programs will typically have a vastly different setup, depending on the specific field that the company actively participates in. Web applications are just the tip of the iceberg for bug bounty programs. The objective of out‐of‐scope reporting is never to discourage a security researcher from reporting, but to ensure that baseline restrictions are placed to prevent legal or financial impact. Bug bounty programs are only as efficient as the engineers and managers that run the program."
9635052,Public Release,"stract:
The public program is meant to be a way of giving anyone and everyone a chance to research. Many enterprises may never reach this state depending on the size of their program, but it's the final incentive that most will want to reach. Regardless of the desired launch, there isn't exactly a right time to launch. The key principle is to not launch too early, to avoid issues with the team being overwhelmed. Managing the public release of a program requires diligent planning and careful execution, especially if the program belongs to a big‐name company. The official recommendation is to release when ready and not based on a specific guideline. While having over 100 hackers seems to be a decent milestone, it may not equate to a prepared enterprise bug bounty program. Rolling a program back into private mode may be the only way to handle a situation in which a program manager wasn't prepared."
9635123,Evaluating Program Operations,"stract:
An enterprise's bug bounty program is only as good as its reputation. Hackers will consistently engage with the program if they feel that it's representing their needs efficiently. An ad hoc program is best defined for an enterprise that has the ability to manage large volumes of vulnerability reports. A private program, compared to an ad hoc program, is a day and night difference. Instead of waiting for researchers to approach the enterprise with vulnerabilities, the responsibility and expectation of the program managers and engineers is to actively seek researchers to participate in their bug bounty program. Visibility equates to greater hacker participation and in turn the organization is responsible for paying the security researchers for their work. The process of identifying an adequate crowdsourcing platform to use is simple: set aside a quarter to evaluate options. Understanding the necessity for an initial period of managed services requires first knowing what managed services do."
9635015,Development and Application Security Collaboration,"stract:
The application security and development roles are vastly different in both workflow and responsibility. An application security engineer will be responsible for the security during the development of the applications and all of the processes involved. Engineers make the mistake of relaying reported vulnerabilities to software engineers in an overly technical way. One of the ways program managers risk hurting the potential for success in an enterprise bug bounty program is with unrealistic expectations or being too lax in management processes. The responsibility of professional accountability falls on the program manager. The most effective way to ensure the bug bounty program is taken seriously is to define steps and methodologies internally and externally, that everyone can refer to. Although a close relative of the category of escalation, continuous accountability is the full responsibility of the program manager."

9631860,Is WhatsApp Plus Malicious? A Review Using Static Analysis,"For cybersecurity activists, reviewing whether an application, including modified applications, is malicious or not is a challenging job. WhatsApp Plus is a messenger application modified from the official WhatsApp application. Comparing the source code of the WhatsApp Plus with the official WhatsApp is one way to review its security or malice. Considering that WhatsApp is very popular and has many users, the results of this investigation are very useful for users to avoid malicious applications. In this study, we have conducted an exploration of the source code of the WhatsApp and WhatsApp Plus applications to find out whether or not WhatsApp Plus has been inserted with malware, spyware, or other malicious code. The exploration used the static analysis method, where the source code of the two applications were decompiled, compared, and analyzed. The de-compilation is done using the MobSF tool and the comparison using the extension of Visual Studio Code called Compare Folders. The differences in the source code found are then analyzed for possible behavior to determine whether it can cause harm, for example stealing user credentials. Although no malicious code was found on WhatsApp Plus, in our study, users must stay alert since they remain vigilant in installing and using WhatsApp Plus because the developer may add malicious code to the next version update."
9539167,Hunt for Unseen Intrusion: Multi-Head Self-Attention Neural Detector,"A network intrusion detection (NID) system plays a critical role in cybersecurity. However, the existing machine learning-based NID research has a vital issue that their experimental settings do not reflect real-world situations where unknown attacks are constantly emerging. In particular, their train and test sets are from a single data set, which inevitably overestimates the detection power since all test attack types are known in training, and test cases will have similar characteristics to the training data. This paper introduces a new strategy to constitute test data with updated traffic with attack types not included in training data. In the proposed setting, the prediction accuracy of the existing detectors is dropped by about 20% compared to what has been reported. Also, in- depth analysis of detection performance by attack types has revealed that the existing models have strength at certain attack types but struggle to detect the other attack types such as DoS, DDoS, web attack, and port scan. To overcome the issues, we propose a new neural detector, called MHSA, based on a multi-head self-attention mechanism whose architecture suits better to capture scattered pieces of evidence in network traffic. Our model improved the overall detection performance by 29% in false positive rate at the true positive rate of 0.9 and by 9% in AUC over the current state-of-the-art models, successfully detecting the attacks that are not well captured before. Furthermore, we show that our proposed MHSA model even outperforms the best ensemble detector constructed by joining the state-of-the-art classifiers."
9591559,AE-MLP: A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for DDoS Detection and Classification,"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are increasing as the demand for Internet connectivity massively grows in recent years. Conventional shallow machine learning-based techniques for DDoS attack classification tend to be ineffective when the volume and features of network traffic, potentially carry malicious DDoS payloads, increase exponentially as they cannot extract high importance features automatically. To address this concern, we propose a hybrid approach named AE-MLP that combines two deep learning-based models for effective DDoS attack detection and classification. The Autoencoder (AE) part of our proposed model provides an effective feature extraction that finds the most relevant feature sets automatically without human intervention (e.g., knowledge of cybersecurity professionals). The Multi-layer Perceptron Network (MLP) part of our proposed model uses the compressed and reduced feature sets produced by the AE as inputs and classifies the attacks into different DDoS attack types to overcome the performance overhead and bias associated with processing large feature sets with noise (i.e., unnecessary feature values). Our experimental results, obtained through comprehensive and extensive experiments on different aspects of performance on the CICDDoS2019 dataset, demonstrate both a very high and robust accuracy rate and F1-score that exceed 98% which also outperformed the performance of many similar methods. This shows that our proposed model can be used as an effective DDoS defense tool against the growing number of DDoS attacks."

Currently, the consumer electronics (CE) community largely ignore the humans in the loop, while framing cybersecurity solutions in the IoT context. In this work, we stress on the need towards a human-centric approach to cybersecurity by shifting focus from ""humans as a problem"" to ""humans as a solution"". We propose a Security & Privacy Preserving (SPP) framework for illustrating how a human-centric approach can be initiated, what are its important components, and how security & privacy can be preserved with a human focus. We hope that the findings will help the CE community to realize the importance of a human-centric approach."
9216102,From Cyber Incidents to Training Cognitive Situation Management: *Work in Progress,"Heterogeneous interacting socio-technical systems, distinct by their own cultures, structures, methods, and machines, are transforming the process of making informed decisions and assessment of situations in the context of cybersecurity into a serious challenge. Stakeholders in each system are forced to take actions at any given time based on the situation. These actions not only affect their own, but also the whole system's properties. Therefore, maintaining cybersecurity will become more difficult. In this work in progress, we attempt to apply a cognitive learning model in agent-based computational economics to create a comprehensive environment for cybersecurity situation modeling, reasoning and learning. Taken together, this enables us to holistically assess the situations and systems' reflexivity, and support human and/or computational understanding of the situations. The aim of this study is to design and develop a hands-on cybersecurity platform to train cognitive situation management in cyber ranges."
9375847,Cyber-Hero: A Gamification framework for Cyber Security Awareness for High Schools Students,"People are considered the weakest point in the information systems which causes most of the cyber-attacks successful. The increasing numbers of cyber-attacks indicate that the traditional methodologies of training and awareness are still insufficient to build the necessary cybersecurity skills and capabilities. Gamification represents a promising methodology to change the behavior of people in the early stages. The objective of this research is not only to verify the effectiveness of gamification but also to provide a constructive application and to propose a framework that helps eventually and iteratively in improving the cyber-security skills and capabilities for high school students in early stages. In this research, we propose a novel framework for information security awareness and training programs, known as Cyber-Hero, that will help fight one of the most popular weaknesses in cybersecurity which is human error. The framework helps in transferring the learning of a narrative set of instructions to be acquired in a serious game, in which students in schools can engage with at an early stage. Such an engagement will educate students on how to create a strong password to protect themselves from cyber-attacks. The preliminary results show incremental progress in the skills and capabilities of cybersecurity for the students using the proposed framework."

9484507,Anomaly Detection in Smart Home Networks Using Kalman Filter,"Throughout the recent decades, smart homes have made an enormous expansion around the world among residential customers; hence the most intimate place for people became connected to cyberspace. This environment attracts more hackers because of the amount and nature of data. Therefore, the cybersecurity in smart home is a real concern for many reasons, and the conventional security methods are not effective in the smart home environment. Therefore, there is an insistent demand to detect these malicious attacks that target smart appliances in smart homes. This paper proposes a novel approach as a real-time cybersecurity monitoring system based on tracking smart home behavior. We utilize a Kalman Filtering algorithm to create an optimal normal behavior for the smart connected devices. Furthermore, energy consumption is utilized as an input to the proposed system, and the Shapiro-Wilk test to detect abnormal behavior. This composite approach leverages the well-known power of Kalman filter and Shapiro-Wilk test to guarantee the effectiveness of the approach. Moreover, energy consumption is an optimal way that exposes smart devices' behavior which makes the other two components more powerful."
9590693,Review of Cybersecurity in LatinAmerica during the Covid-19 Pandemic. A brief Overview,"The arrival of the covid-19 pandemic has generated a turning point in the way people live. A maj or role for telecommunications technology has been playing in enabling interaction between people and the productivity of people within an organization, despite restrictions put in place by several governments because of the pandemic. The massive use of ICT also exposes users and organizations to be victims of a possible cyber-attack. This paper aims to review the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on cybersecurity in Latin America, which have been the most recurrent attacks and some reported cases. For this purpose, we examined a literature review on the different types of cyberattacks, reports provided by multiple organizations in the field of cybersecurity, and news from Latin American countries about cybercrimes related to the covid-19 pandemic. It also discusses a trend in cyberattacks and some recommendations to improve cybersecurity for individuals and organizations. It concludes by defending the need to have a culture of cybersecurity to minimize the impact of cyber-attacks at both the organizational and individual levels."
8753854,Improving Performance and Cybersecurity in an IoT-based System of Systems Integrating Robots and Virtual Human,"Two humanoid robots and a virtual human were separately integrated through an loT-based common platform as a system of systems to collaborate with each other for performing a selected real-world task. The task was to collaboratively search for a hidden or missing object in a social setting (e.g., home) for human beneficiaries. Both robots were human-like, but one was more human-like than the other. The virtual human was also made human-like. The robots and the virtual human (called the agents) were made intelligent and autonomous by enriching them with similar functions and interaction modes, and they were integrated through the IoT-based common platform. The agents were then animated via the common platform based on some intelligent control algorithms to perform the selected task in collaboration. The IoT-based platform was then evaluated for performance towards achieving success in the collaboration and maintaining cybersecurity in the IoT network. The cybersecurity assessment results were compared with that when the agents were controlled individually without being integrated via the IoT for the same collaborative task. The results showed that the performance in the IoT -based collaboration was satisfactory in various terms, which proved the effectiveness of the IoT -based integration of the agents as a system of systems. The assessment results also showed higher potential of the IoT -based system to secure cybersecurity over the non IoT -based individual control of the agents. The results can help develop system of systems integrating intelligent real and virtual agents via IoT frameworks to perform real-world complex tasks for humans with higher performance and better cybersecurity."
9705918,Towards modeling of naval systems interdependencies for cybersecurity,"To ensure a ship’s fully operational status in a wide spectrum of missions, as passenger transportation, international trade, and military activities, numerous interdependent systems are essential. Despite the potential critical consequences of misunderstanding or ignoring those interdependencies, there are very few documented approaches to enable their identification, representation, analysis, and use. From the cybersecurity point of view, if an anomaly occurs on one of the interdependent systems, it could eventually impact the whole ship, jeopardizing its mission success. This paper presents a proposal to identify the main dependencies of layers within and between generic ship’s functional blocks. An analysis of one of these layers, the platform systems, is developed to examine a naval cyber-physical system (CPS), the water management for passenger use, and its associated dependencies, from an intrinsic perspective. This analysis generates a three layers graph, on which dependencies are represented as oriented edges. Each abstraction level of the graph represents the physical, digital, and system variables of the examined CPS. The obtained result confirms the interest of graphs for dependencies representation and analysis. It is an operational depiction of the different systems interdependencies, on which can rely a cybersecurity evaluation, like anomaly detection and propagation assessment."
9112114,Cybersecurity in Large-Scale Smart Cities: Novel Proposals for Anomaly Detection from Edge to Cloud,"Smart cities are a complicated blend of Information and communications technology (ICT) as well as Internet of Things (IoT) from physical (such as sensors and actuators) and non-physical (such as external databases) data sources. The smart physical data sources contribute to developing the level of safety and security of citizens' daily life through different smart solutions such as optimization for autonomous power grids and human health applications. Those physical devices generate a massive amount of data that is necessary for analytic applications to be applied in user services. Cloud computing technologies utilize as a centralized ICT architecture to collect the massive amount of data from all scale of the city and build the citizens' services by developers. However, several challenges in cybercrime and cybersecurity exist in Cloud computing technologies as well as large scale IoT environments and smart cities. Those challenges are i) the new generation of the attack on an IoT network is to create a problem with the availability of IoT data for the Cloud applications by overwhelming devices with information requests; ii) complex communication and computation resource constraints has a big concern to moving forward to detect attack at the edge of networks. Therefore, heading off the threat of cybercrime in large scale IoT and smart cities calls for a new study on designing cybersecurity models for ICT architecture. In this paper, we first present our fully hierarchal Distributed-to-Centralized ICT (D2C-ICT) architecture for the Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN) center in the context of the smart cities. Second, we propose two different novel anomaly detection models by using the contribution of Fog to cloudlet and Cloud technologies through our presented D2C-ICT Architecture in the context of the smart city. Finally, we discuss two different use cases for attack detection. We envisage that we can enhance the level of attack detection techniques through different...

9672062,Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph Improvement with Graph Neural Networks,"Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) help in aggregating information about cyber-events. CKGs combined with reasoning and querying systems such as SPARQL enable security researchers to look up information about past cyberevents that is helpful in understanding future cyber-events or drawing similarity with a known cyber-event recorded in a CKG. CKGs have assertions in the form of semantic triples. The triples describe a relationship between a subject and object, both of which are cybersecurity entities. The quality of information present in the CKG depends on the data source. Since data sources can have varying degrees of reliability, we need a score that should help us benchmark the veracity of the CKG assertions. Verifying the information asserted in the CKG is a challenging task. In this paper, we describe a novel method that associates a score with the semantic triples asserted in the CKG using deep learning. We use semantic triples that we know are correct, in a supervised machine learning algorithm that produces the output for each relationship. In particular, we use Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) on a dataset of CKGs that can be used to ascertain the scores for each semantic triple."

9677160,Quantum-Key-Distribution Based Microgrid Control for Cybersecurity Enhancement,"The integration of information and communication technology in the smart grid has introduced cybersecurity challenges to traditional communication solutions, which threatens data integrity and confidentiality in microgrid control. This paper proposed a measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) based microgrid control architecture to ensure the security of control and measurement dataflows in microgrids. The following contributions are made in this work: 1) A novel quantum secure microgrid control architecture is proposed to enhance the cybersecurity in microgrid. 2) MDI-QKD with asymmetric protocols is offered in the QKD-enabled microgrid control process. 3) A method of fast parameter optimization based on neural network is presented to enable the QKD network to rapidly adapt the changes of communication environments. Simulation results show how the quantum secure microgrid control architecture works in an islanded microgrid with 4 distributed generation units, and the testing of neural network proves the feasibility of our method."
9656744,"Agile Approaches for Cybersecurity Systems, IoT and Intelligent Transportation","To adapt to the rapidly increasing vulnerabilities in software products and cyber threats that exploit them, security professionals are actively working with software developers to produce more secure systems. In software development, agile methods are increasingly adopted in critical software projects where security risks are prominent challenges. This adoption stems from the fact that agile methods are highly iterative and support delivering services and products in smaller batches which allows security professionals to seamlessly integrate software development security activities with agile methodologies. In addition, the iterative nature of agile software development encourages frequent inspections, tests, and patching of software systems to mitigate cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. Considering the massive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) products, the challenge of software development while addressing the security and safety concerns of these devices will continue to increase. This paper presents a comprehensive and detailed review of agile software development in the context of IoT, ITS, and their cybersecurity and risk challenges. Furthermore, we provide a systematic comparison of the reviewed literature based on a set of defined criteria. Finally, we provide a broader outlook and an outline for designing future security-enhanced agile software development solutions for IoT and ITS systems."

Existing research works have not shown effective techniques for the vulnerability assessment and countermeasures against cyberattacks for the AC power systems. In this paper, we emphasize the impact of cybersecurity on siting distributed generation (DG) units in the AC power grid. We present an AC-based false data injection (FDI) attack model to analyze the cyber vulnerabilities of the system and propose an optimal defense strategy to prevent cyber incidents on these units. We perform experiments on the SaskPower network of Saskatchewan, Canada, to demonstrate the optimal siting for DG units under the cybersecurity constraint. Our simulation results obtained for the SaskPower grid show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches to analyze the cyber vulnerabilities of the power grid and find secure sites for the DG units in Saskatchewan."
9494255,Cybersecurity Analytics for Virtual Power Plants,"This article presents a framework to realize cybersecure virtual power plant (VPP). The foundation of this cybersecurity analytics is established on a developed normal operation region identification methodology. This normal operation region is exploited as a confirmation strategy to distinguish malicious set-points that are determined by VPP cyber-layer. These malicious set-points are spawned by a cyber-attacker influencing the VPP cyber-layer. The normal operation region is based on a derived one-to-one mapping between the network internal point of common coupling (PCC) bus voltages and the cyber-layer generated set-points. This derived mapping is compared with an inverse mapping through internal PCC bus voltage monitoring for anomalies. Once, an inconsistency is witnessed by the cybersecurity analytics between the one-to-one mapping and the inverse mapping, then the initial voltage anomaly detected by the monitoring system is due to an intrusion. The developed theory is validated through simulation of a cyber attacker gradually violating the network stability boundary through manipulating the operation set-points."
9685940,UltraLearn: Next-Generation CyberSecurity Learning Platform,"Learning was always an essential part of our lives to acquire knowledge and move forward. However, the increasing wages of on-campus learning leads to an increasing need for an alternate way of learning. With the outbreak of COVID-19, people needed to stay at home for safety. Therefore, finding an answer to this need became more dominant. Another major problem, especially in the ongoing decade, is the lack of enough cybersecurity knowledge by the common folk. This paper aims to look at a new platform that is carefully designed to teach cybersecurity to learners with any background. We design this system using gamification to increase the efficiency of learning. Because modern technologies are ubiquitous in our lives, particularly during the coronavirus outbreak, including practical work in teaching will be quite beneficial. The practical activity has a clear advantage, such as promoting experimental learning and improving student abilities and skills for the future professional career. Finally, we assess this method with a classic learning approach using two different groups."
9700240,What are the Latest Cybersecurity Trends? A Case Study Grounded in Language Models,"The year 2020 marked an important moment when the COVID-19 pandemic promoted Internet as a necessity even more than before, especially for school activities and businesses. This increased usage emphasized the importance of cybersecurity, a frequently overlooked subject by the common users, which in return plays a crucial role in safe Internet browsing. This paper introduces an approach grounded in Natural Language Processing techniques to identify the main trends in security news and empowers the analysis of vulnerable products, active attacks, as well as existing methods of defence against new attacks. Our dataset consists of 2264 news articles published on cybersecurity dedicated websites between January 2017 and May 2021. The RoBERTa language model was used to compute the texts embeddings, followed by dimensionality reduction techniques and topic clustering methods. Articles were grouped into approximately 20 clusters that were thoroughly evaluated in terms of importance and evolution."
9628932,Experimental Researches of Biometric Authentication Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Histograms of Oriented Graphs,"User authentication technologies are an important component of modern cybersecurity. These technologies are designed to verify the correctness and validity, for example, by verifying the authenticity of entered passwords, identifiers, certain biometric features, and so on. We consider biometric authentication techniques for the human face. Two techniques are used to process biometric features in our work: convolutional neural networks and histograms of directed gradients. We conduct experimental research to study these techniques and compare the results of both in terms of authentication accuracy and the speed of processing biometric images. The obtained results will be useful in the development and implementation of cybersecurity applications that use biometric authentication"
8920556,On the Requirements for Serious Games Geared Towards Software Developers in the Industry,"Teaching industry staff on cybersecurity issues is a fundamental activity that must be undertaken in order to guarantee the delivery of successful and robust products to market. Much research attention has been devoted to this topic over the last years. However, the research which has been done has not focused on developing secure code in industrial environments. In this paper we take a look at the constraints and requirements for delivering a training, by means of cybersecurity challenges, that covers secure coding topics from an industry perspective. Using requirements engineering, we aim at understanding the design requirements for such challenges. Along the way, we give details on our experience of delivering cybersecurity challenges in an industrial setting and show the outcome and lessons learned. The proposed requirements for cybersecurity challenges geared towards software developers in an industrial environment are based on systematic literature review, interviews with security experts from the industry and semi-structured evaluation of participant feedback."
9303431,"Improving Data Security, Privacy, and Interoperability for the IEEE Biometric Open Protocol Standard","Enhancing security, privacy, and interoperability of biometric networks and protocols has been a challenge for many research works for many years. The several proposed approaches still need to integrate these three characteristics while showing security evidence for biometric applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a probabilistic scheme to encrypt biometric database indexes and a novel approach to interoperability among systems interchanging biometric characteristics, thus enhancing the IEEE Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS). We highlight two meaningful improvements in our research when compared to related works. The first one comes from the proposed cryptographic techniques and network schemes. It implies a negligible probability for known attacks to be successful against the proposal, due to its semantic security evidence, as well as the difficulties that it imposes to the attacks, given the high complexity barriers that are unfeasible for the attacker to break in polynomial time, including the modified initialization vector and the nonce for the encryption algorithm. The second improvement comprises the new integrity and control procedures for biometric identification requests that boost the IEEE BOPS’ reliability and contribute to interoperability purposes. The security analysis, proofs, and results demonstrate that the new proposed biometric network is faultless regarding integrity and interoperability while preserving the anonymity of persons whose biometric data is exchanged in the network and stored in the related databases."
8909930,Grand Challenge: Applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Cybersecurity,"Cybersecurity is a key risk for any business as the number of attacks are increasing. Growing attacks on cybersecurity are threatening our existence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can help detect threats and provide recommendations to cyber analysts. Advancing the adoption of AI/ML applied to cybersecurity requires partnering of industry, academia, and government on a global scale."
9592816,Integrating Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence Research in Engineering and Computer Science Education,We summarize integrating cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI) research in cybersecurity education and implementing a module in an existing noncybersecurity undergraduate engineering course. This initiative will drive the broader community to focus on the convergence of cybersecurity and AI education.
9659888,Explainability of Cybersecurity Threats Data Using SHAP,"Nowadays, cybersecurity threats have become a worrisome issue that need to be addressed in all of the world. Almost all people have smart devices that are connected worldwide and many are using social media platforms, and thus, most of their personal information is used and shared. An example of cybersecurity threats are malicious URLs and malware, which are very likely to impact general users. For the research community, detecting new types of attacks is a challenge. Most of the past research studies focused on surveying malicious attack detection. The classification models detect the kind of attacks by using machine learning approaches. Interpreting machine learning models is also an important issue. Tree, Deep, and Kernel of SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) are well-known techniques, which achieve efficient performance in interpreting the results. In this paper, two cyber data sets are investigated, both being five-class data sets, for which the Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classification, and the Keras Sequential algorithms are applied. The obtained results confirm that applying the classifiers to generate the models are good choices to detect cybersecurity threats. The efficacy of these models' performance was evaluated by measuring the precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and confusion matrix. In addition, three SHAP methods are used to explain the output of the resulting machine learning models for the five-class data sets."
8960519,Cybersecurity of Plug-In Electric Vehicles: Cyberattack Detection During Charging,"While large scale deployment of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) offers promising advantages, such as environmental benefits, energy security, and economic stability, it also poses certain cybersecurity related challenges. Unlike power grid security, PEV cybersecurity is significantly underexplored. However, cyberattacks on PEVs may lead to disastrous situations such as out-of-service EVs via denial-of-charging (DoC) or battery pack damage via overcharging. In this article, we attempt to address this issue by exploring control-oriented approaches for PEV cybersecurity. Specifically, we focus on designing algorithms for detecting cyberattacks that can potentially affect PEV battery packs during charging. We discuss two algorithms: first, static detector that utilizes only measured variables, and, second, dynamic detector that utilizes the knowledge of system dynamics along with the measurements. Furthermore, we propose a filter-based design approach for the dynamic detector that considers a multiobjective criterion including stability, robustness, and attack sensitivity. We perform theoretical analysis and simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms under DoC and overcharging attacks that indicate the superiority of dynamic detector in terms of attack detectability."
8909783,A Synthesized Dataset for Cybersecurity Study of IEC 61850 based Substation,"Cyber attacks pose a major threat to smart grid infrastructures where communication links bind physical devices to provide critical measurement, protection, and control functionalities. Substation is an integral part of a power system. Modern substations with intelligent electronic devices and remote access interface are more prone to cyber attacks. Hence, there is an urgent need to consider cybersecurity at the electrical substation level. This paper makes a systematic effort to develop a synthesized dataset focusing on IEC 61850 GOOSE communication that is essential for automation and protection in smart grid. The dataset is intended to facilitate the research community to study the cybersecurity of substations. We present the physical system of a typical distribution level substation and several of its critical electrical protection operation scenarios under different disturbances, followed by several cyber-attack scenarios. We have generated a dataset with multiple traces that correspond to these scenarios and demonstrated how the dataset can be used to support substation cybersecurity research."
9724182,Adversarial Detection by Latent Style Transformations,"Detection-based defense approaches are effective against adversarial attacks without compromising the structure of the protected model. However, they could be bypassed by stronger adversarial attacks and are limited in their ability to handle high-fidelity images. In this paper, we explore an effective detection-based defense against adversarial attacks on images (including high-resolution images) by extending the investigation beyond a single-instance perspective to incorporate its transformations as well. Our intuition is that the essential characteristics of a valid image are generally not affected by non-essential style transformations, for example, a slight variation in the facial expression of a portrait would not alter its identification. In contrast, adversarial examples are designed to affect only a single instance at a time, with unpredictable effects on a set of transformations of the instance. Consequently, we leverage a controllable generative mechanism to conduct the non-essential style transformations for a given image via modification along the style axis in the latent space. Next, the consistency of prediction between the given input and its style transformations is used to distinguish adversarial instances. Based on experiments on three image datasets, including high-resolution images, we demonstrated that our defense could detect 90–100 percent of adversarial examples produced by various state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, with a low false-positive rate."
9637224,Mirror Mirror On The Wall - What Are Cybersecurity Educational Games Offering Overall: A Research Study and Gap Analysis,"Cybersecurity educational games are capable of meeting a variety of goals, including learning of fundamental cybersecurity concepts, exposure to cybersecurity literacy, basic awareness, experiential learning plus situational awareness, and being a medium for K-12 outreach, college level learning plus corporate training. Existing literature shows that there have been several prior research surveys focused on analyzing cybersecurity educational games from various viewpoints. However, to our knowledge, there has been no previous work that has analyzed cybersecurity educational games in terms of their alignment with the current benchmarks in academic and industry standards that include the cybersecurity curriculum plus assessment guidelines in higher education, the K-12 standardized cybersecurity concepts, and the cybersecurity job-related functions. In an effort to address this research gap, we use the CSEC2017 curricular guidelines, the Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) model, the National Security Agency (NSA) GenCyber concepts and the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework for performing a unique analysis of a list of popular cybersecurity educational games, plus a few Capture the Flag (CTF) instances. The list of cyber educational games, which we study, comprises of Anti-Phishing Phil, Cyber Awareness Challenge, Cyber CIEGE, Cyber Protect, Nsteens, NOVA Labs, What.Hack, PASDJO, CyberStart Go, OnGuardOnline, Safe Online Surfing, and Interland. This non-traditional survey-based research work demonstrates a novel, multi-faceted approach for analyzing popular opensource cybersecurity educational games in terms of their alignment with the standard academic and industry benchmarks. Our survey results include conceptual mapping of these cyber educational games to (1) the CSEC2017 curricular knowledge areas (Data Security, Software Security, Component Security, Connection Security, System Security, Human Security, Organizational Security and S...

8662071,Runtime Integrity Verification in Cyber-physical Systems using Side-Channel Fingerprint,"The world is moving towards a connected ecosystem of cyber-physical components, which are increasingly deployed in diverse fields, from automobiles, to power grids, city infrastructure, manufacturing, and biomedical systems. Majority of these applications call for physical proximity of users to the system due to the nature of the service (e.g., health care). Both remote (through a network) and physical access to these systems have significantly broadened the attack surface of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) by providing increased flexibility to observe and alter the system maliciously. Many such systems are deployed in critical applications requiring a high level of operational integrity. Existing solutions for attack detection and prevention are often not adequate, specifically with respect to emerging vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focus on run-time monitoring of CPS with respect to attacks on hardware and software. In particular, we present the motivation for run-time monitoring and then propose methods for detection of physical attacks on hardware and activation of malicious programs in system software, both of which are severe threats to traditional and emerging applications of CPS. We propose a power-up and runtime hardware-software integrity monitoring of sensing and computing equipment in CPS through continuous observation of various side-channel parameters using a plug-and-play hardware module. We present a systematic framework that includes signature generation and comparison technique through device calibration, noise reduction, and workload analysis. Finally, we present a framework for monitoring two side-channel parameters (namely, power and electromagnetic radiation) to detect component replacement and malicious code execution."
9425997,Human-Centric Issues in eHealth App Development and Usage: A Preliminary Assessment,"Health-related mobile applications are known as eHealth apps. These apps make people more aware of their health, help during critical situations, provide home-based disease management, and monitor/support personalized care through sensing/interaction. eHealth app usage is rapidly increasing with a large number of new apps being developed. Unfortunately, many eHealth apps do not successfully adopt Human-Centric Issues (HCI) in the app development process and its deployment stages, leading them to become ineffective and not inclusive of diverse end-users. This paper provides an initial assessment of key human factors related to eHealth apps by literature review, existing guidelines analysis, and user studies. Preliminary results suggest that Usability, Accessibility, Reliability, Versatility, and User Experience are essential HCIs for eHealth apps, and need further attention from researchers and practitioners. Therefore, outcomes of this research will look to amend support for users, developers, and stakeholders of eHealth apps in the form of improved actionable guidelines, best practice examples, and evaluation techniques. The research also aims to trial the proposed solutions on real-world projects."
8846762,Deep Learning Hierarchical Representation From Heterogeneous Flow-Level Communication Data,"The success of a detection model depends heavily on feature engineering. Deep learning has been successfully applied in numerous research fields as a universal representation learning method. However, the heterogeneity of flow-level communication data obstructs the application of deep learning to communication representation learning, and research on this problem is still lacking. To cope with this problem, we propose a heterogeneous communication data-encoding approach to extract fixed-size encoding data to apply deep learning to heterogeneous communication data by preserving the spatiotemporal characteristics of the data. Then, we propose a feature extractor based on deep learning to automatically learn hierarchical and robust communication representations without expert knowledge. We show that the proposed approach can replicate and optimize the key steps of feature engineering well and learn hierarchical representations directly from heterogeneous communication data. Moreover, compared with features extracted with principal component analysis (PCA), manifold learning and manually crafted methods, the features extracted by deep learning are more robust and are characterized by their better adaptability to various classifiers and datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the initial work here is the first to apply deep learning techniques to heterogeneous flow-level data; consequently, the heterogeneous communication data processing method can provide technical means for the application of deep learning in other communication-related research fields."
8883222,A Novel IoT-Perceptive Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Approach Using Multihead Convolutional Attention,"Together with the fast advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart healthcare applications and systems are equipped with increasingly more wearable sensors and mobile devices. These sensors are used not only to collect data but also, and more importantly, to assist in daily activity tracking and analyzing of their users. Various human activity recognition (HAR) approaches are used to enhance such tracking. Most of the existing HAR methods depend on exploratory case-based shallow feature learning architectures, which struggle with correct activity recognition when put into real-life practice. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that utilizes the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the attention mechanism for HAR. In the presented method, the activity recognition accuracy is improved by incorporating attention into multihead CNNs for better feature extraction and selection. Proof of concept experiments are conducted on a publicly available data set from wireless sensor data mining (WISDM) lab. The results demonstrate a higher accuracy of our proposed approach in comparison with the current methods."
9006725,Leveraging Unspecified Functionality in Obfuscated Hardware for Trojan and Fault Attacks,"Logic obfuscation is a promising countermeasure for thwarting hardware security threats such as Intellectual Property (IP) theft, counterfeit and hardware Trojans. However, existing works in this realm primarily focus on developing more secure obfuscation techniques or on the other hand more effective attacks to retrieve the obfuscation key while neglecting the potential security threats resulting from the huge unspecified design state space and don't care conditions associated with incorrect keys. In this paper, we demonstrate how such unspecified functionality could possibly open up a door for hardware Trojan and fault injection attacks. The security risks hidden behind these don't cares conditions can be both hard to identify and eliminate since there is no golden design specification under incorrect keys for comparison. We reveal this potential security threat, demonstrate possible attack scenarios, and provide detectability analysis to help eliminate such new attack surfaces."
9714270,ClockIDS: A Real-time Vehicle Intrusion Detection System Based on Clock Skew,"Although intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) can better assist drivers and improve their driving experience, they have huge network security problems and are frequently attacked. This is because vehicle network is connected to the Internet, which expands the attack surface of ICV, and attackers have more ways to launch attacks. In recent years, many security experts fight against attackers and propose various types of vehicle intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to protect controller area network (CAN). However, with the continuous enhancement of attack means, especially the appearance of masquerade attack, most IDSs are no longer applicable. In this paper, we design a new fingerprint-based vehicle IDS to protect the CAN, called ClockIDS. It establishes a unique fingerprint for each electronic control unit (ECU) based on clock skew. On this basis, ClockIDS realizes the functions of intrusion detection and attack source identification by utilizing empirical rule and dynamic time warping. It neither occupies the bandwidth of CAN bus, nor needs to modify the CAN protocol. Our experiments on two real vehicles show that ClockIDS can establish a unique fingerprint for ECU without being affected by the size of message period, and can detect three types of attack with a detection accuracy of 98.63%. In addition, this system can identify the attack source, and the average recognition accuracy is 96.77%. Furthermore, ClockIDS has high real-time performance, and the average time cost of each detection is only 1.99 ms."
8821517,DTA-HOC: Online HTTPS traffic service identification using DNS in large-scale networks,"An increasing number of websites are making use of HTTPS encryption to enhance security and privacy for their users. However, HTTPS encryption makes it very difficult to identify the service over HTTPS flows, which poses challenges to network security management. In this paper we present DTA-HOC, a novel DNS-based two-level association HTTPS traffic online service identification method for large-scale networks, which correlates HTTPS flows with DNS flows using big data stream processing and association technologies to label the service in an HTTPS flow with a specific associated domain name. DTA-HOC has been specifically designed to address three practical challenges in the service identification process: domain name ambiguity, domain name query invisibility, and data association time window size contradictions. Several experiments on datasets collected from a 10-Gbps campus network are conducted alongside offline and online testing. Results show that DTA-HOC can achieve an average online association rate on HTTPS traffic of 83% and a generic accuracy of 86.16%. Its processing time for one minute of data is less than 20 seconds. These results indicate that DTA-HOC is an efficient method for online identification of services in HTTPS flows for large-scale networks. Moreover, our proposed method can contribute to the identification of other applications which make a Domain Name System (DNS) communication before establishing a connection."
9251211,Detection of DoH Tunnels using Time-series Classification of Encrypted Traffic,"Computer networks have fallen easy prey to cyber attacks in the ever-evolving internet services. Domain Name System (DNS) has also not remained untouched with these cybercrime attempts. Encrypted HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic over Secure Socket Layer (SSL), alternatively called HTTPS, has succeeded to prevent DNS attacks to a great extent. To secure DNS traffic, the security community has introduced the concept of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to improve user privacy and security by combating eavesdropping and DNS data manipulation on the way to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. This paper discusses one of the persistent security concerns, abuse of DNS protocol to create covert channels by tunneling data through DNS packets. We identify tunneling activities that utilize DNS communications over HTTPS by presenting a two-layered approach to detect and characterize DoH traffic using time-series classifiers."
9457875,Extraction of Key Concept Relevance Graphs From Fourteen Decades of Psychoanalytic Journal Publications,"Automatically tracing the history of concepts and terms by text mining diachronic corpora is a new multidisciplinary area of research. An essential step in the pipeline of such research is calculating the relevance of terms, with most work relying on simple frequency measures. In this study, we extract relevance graphs of key psychoanalytic concepts from a corpus built for this task, one that represents the entire history of psychoanalysis. Different measures of relevance are examined and shown to tell a different story; when combined, however, they provide a clearer picture of a term's significance over time."
9260158,Predictive Prefetching Based on User Interaction for Web Applications,"Web prefetching is a key technology to hide network latencies from users. Conventional prefetching methods, however, misconstrue the purpose of user's browsing behaviors and resulting experience due to their dependence on statistical characteristics or metadata of individual Web applications. In this letter, we propose a predictive prefetching scheme, WebPrefetcher, which utilizes interaction events to decipher user's genuine intention and context. Our intensive performance analysis results obtained with a real Web browser demonstrate that WebPrefetcher improves user-perceived quality of experience noticeably, outperforming competitive models."
9148813,Achieving Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Range Query in Fog-enhanced IoT with Bloom Filter,"Fog-enhanced Internet of Things (IoT), which can locally process data at the network edge for better response to the IoT field and pre-computation for further efficient process at the cloud side, has attracted substantial studies in recent years. However, as the fog device is not fully trustable at the network edge, more advancement in efficiency and privacy should be considered to persuade enterprises to migrate to fog and cloud environments. With this in mind, in this paper, we propose a new communication-efficient privacy-preserving range query in the fog-enhanced IoT. The proposed scheme is characterized by employing Paillier homomorphic cryptosystem and ingenious Bloom filter data structure for simultaneously achieving better privacy and higher efficiency in the count aggregation in a privacy-preserving range query scenario. More precisely,
(n+|E|)logn
-bit communication efficiency can be achieved by our proposed scheme where
n,|E|
are respectively the range size and the ciphertext size. Detailed security analysis shows that our proposed scheme really achieves the privacy preservation in the range query. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed scheme."
9739555,Identifying Specious LUTs for Satisfiability Don’t Care Trojan Detection,"Satisfiability don’t cares (SDCs) have recently been exploited for malicious design modifications, where an SDC signal pair is used as two discrete Trojan triggers. The don’t care condition can never be satisfied under normal operation and the Trojan can only be activated through fault injection. However, each trigger signal is able to switch normally. Consequently, SDC Trojans are resilient to state-of-the-art side channel as well as switching probability analysis based Trojan detection techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel SDC Trojan detection method leveraging open source FPGA design flow and synthesis tool upon the observation that the two discrete SDC Trojan trigger signals would connect to common look-up tables (LUTs) after synthesis. Although each address line of the LUTs is able to switch normally, certain LUT entries cannot be covered during limited tests. By identifying such specious LUTs with coverage issues, we can pinpoint stealthy SDC Trojan designs. Experimental results show that our detection method precisely captures SDC Trojans without any low-switching signals."
8686093,Analyzing and Identifying Data Breaches in Underground Forums,"Recently, underground forums play a crucial role in trading and exchanging leaked personal information. Meanwhile, the forums have been gradually used as data breaches' information sources. Therefore, it shows an upward trend in announcing the results of data theft by posting in the forums. Identifying these threads can make the compromised third-party respond quickly to the data breach incident. For this purpose, we presented a system to identify the threads which are related to data breaches automatically. The system can monitor and discover data breaches in underground forums in real-time. In addition, the study further revealed the wording characteristics of the threads by applying the feature extraction method based on LDA topic model. In this paper, the data set was collected from the surface web and the dark web. Besides, to improve the performance of the system, we compared various supervised classification algorithms in this application scenario and selected the best method for the classifier. Through the system, we identified more than 92% of data breach threads on the experimental data set."
8919479,End to end message encryption using Poly1305 and XSalsa20 in Low power and Lossy Networks,"Security has been considered as a key concern in real world deployments of Low power and Lossy networks (LLNs). It has been challenging to ensure a secure communication between the constrained devices. IPSec and DTLS are known not to be amenable to immediate LLN applications due to their memory footprint and the amount of traffic established during their session. In this paper, we propose to use the so-called Authenticated Encryption (AE) that is based on Poly1305 and XSalsa20 to provide confidentiality, integrity and authenticity over the data packets. Experiments are carried out using Contiki OS, an open source operating system for the Internet of Things. They demonstrate that AE has extremely high speed, requires very little resource, and can be implemented in constrained environments."
9697382,An Experimental Assessment of Using Theoretical Defect Predictors to Guide Search-Based Software Testing,"Automated test generators, such as search-based software testing (SBST) techniques are primarily guided by coverage information. As a result, they are very effective at achieving high code coverage. However, is high code coverage alone sufficient to detect bugs effectively In this paper, we propose a new SBST technique, predictive many objective sorting algorithm (PreMOSA), which augments coverage information with defect prediction information to decide where to increase the test coverage in the class under test (CUT). Through an experimental evaluation using 420 labelled bugs on the Defects4J benchmark and using theoretical defect predictors, we demonstrate the improved effectiveness and efficiency of PreMOSA in detecting bugs when using any acceptable defect predictor, i.e., a defect predictor with recall and precision 75%, compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic many objective sorting algorithm (DynaMOSA). PreMOSA detects up to 8.3% more labelled bugs on average than DynaMOSA when given a time budget of 2 minutes for test generation per CUT."
9581307,SQSE: A Measure to Assess Sample Quality of Authorial Style as a Cognitive Biometric Trait,"Stylistic analysis of text is a widely researched topic in both cognitive biometrics and linguistics. Often referred to as Authorship Attribution (AA), the scope of this problem has expanded from a few hundred authors with similar data characteristics to large-scale corpora having several thousand authors and cross-domain samples. Even though the AA algorithms have evolved to keep up with the requirements of the community, the process for choosing an appropriate text sample with good style characteristics has remained poorly defined. This paper, for the first time, formalizes the sample selection process using a style quality evaluation measure for AA, called Sample Quality for Style Extraction (SQSE). Furthermore, we will demonstrate the utility of the measure on multiple large-scale cross-domain corpora with over 6,500 authors and 250,000 text samples. The SQSE measure, supported by over 200 experiments and 4 million comparisons, exhibits a strong positive correlation with matching performance on a wide variety of AA algorithms resulting in a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87, and positively identifies samples of good stylometric quality."
9685450,Spatio-Temporal Similarity based Privacy-Preserving Worker Selection in Mobile Crowdsensing,"As one of the most fundamental problems in mobile crowdsensing (MCS), worker selection has drawn significant attention in recent years. However, very few studies consider the workers' spatio- and temporal-coverage for the sensing task. In this paper, we propose a novel top-k worker selection scheme such that the MCS platform can select qualified workers in terms of spatio-temporal similarity. Besides, we design a novel privacy-preserving approach for protecting participants' spatio-temporal information based on the modified Paillier encryption technique. Detailed security analysis showed that the task re-questor's temporal information and the workers' spatio-temporal information are preserved and will not be revealed to any other parties. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms the baseline methods regarding the selection of reliable workers."
9403470,License Plate Detection Methods Based on OpenCV,"With the popularization of automobile and the progress of computer vision detection technology, intelligent license plate detection technology has gradually become an important part of intelligent traffic management. License plate detection is used to segment vehicle image and obtain license plate area for follow-up recognition system to screen. It is widely used in intelligent traffic management, vehicle video monitoring and other fields. In this paper, two license plate detection methods are studied, one is based on Sobel edge detection and the other is based on morphological gradient detection. Basing on OpenCV and visual studio 2012 under Windows system, two methods of license plate detection are implemented, and the two algorithms are compared in detail from the aspects of license plate detection accuracy. These methods have high efficiency and good interactivity, which provide a reference for later license plate recognition."
9618870,Deep Reinforcement Learning for Securing Software-Defined Industrial Networks With Distributed Control Plane,"The development of software-defined industrial networks (SDIN) promotes the programmability and customizability of the industrial networks and is suitable to cope with the challenges brought by new manufacturing modes. For building more scalable and reliable SDIN, a distributed control plane with multicontroller collaboration becomes a promising option. However, as the brain of SDIN, the security of the distributed control plane is rarely considered. In addition to suffering direct attacks, each controller is also subjected to attacks propagated by other controllers because of information sharing or management domain takeover, resulting in the spread of attacks in a wider range than a single controller. Therefore, in this article, we study attacks against SDIN with distributed control plane, demonstrate their propagation across multiple controllers, and analyze their impacts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the security of SDIN with distributed control plane. In addition, since the existing defense mechanisms are not specifically designed for distributed SDIN and cannot defend it perfectly, we propose an attack mitigation scheme based on deep reinforcement learning to adaptively prevent the spread of attacks. Specifically, the novelty of our scheme lies in its ability of learning from the environment and flexibly adjusting the switch takeover decisions to isolate the attack source, so as to tolerate attacks and enhance the resilience of SDIN."
9543688,REFICS: Assimilating Data-Driven Paradigms Into Reverse Engineering and Hardware Assurance on Integrated Circuits,"Comprehensive hardware assurance approaches guaranteeing trust on Integrated Circuits (ICs) typically require the verification of the IC design layout and functionality through destructive Reverse Engineering (RE). It is a resource intensive process that will benefit greatly from the extensive integration of data-driven paradigms, especially in the imaging and image analysis phase. Although obvious, this uptake of data-driven approaches into RE-assisted hardware assurance is lagging due to the lack of massive amounts of high-quality labelled data. In this paper, a large-scale synthetic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) dataset, REFICS, is introduced to address this issue. The dataset, the first open-source dataset in the RE community, consists of 800,000 SEM images over two node technologies, 32nm and 90nm, and four cardinal layers of the IC, namely, doping, polysilicon, contact and metal layers. Furthermore, a framework, based on uncertainty and risk, is introduced to compare the efficacy and benefits of existing RE workflows utilizing ad-hoc steps in its execution.

Finally, the work is concluded with the performance analysis of existing machine learning and deep learning approaches for image analysis in RE and hardware assurance."
9199108,Design of a Compliance Index for Privacy Policies: A Study of Mobile Wallet and Remittance Services,"Many nations have adopted comprehensive data privacy laws to protect customers’ data. However, privacy policies of mobile wallet digital payment systems (DPS), and particularly the mobile wallet and remittance services that are part of DPS, are often not compliant with privacy laws. There is a lack of measures to assess how adequate the policies are in addressing data privacy issues. To address this problem, this article develops a compliance index to help DPS organizations assess the compliance of their privacy policies with the general data protection regulation (GDPR). The compliance index is created through a natural language process that includes term frequency-inverse document frequency matrix and topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation, to compute 1) an emphasis density score that indicates the level of emphasis a privacy policy places on GDPR dimensions, and 2) a privacy score that identifies the level of compliance of a privacy policy with GDPR. The compliance index is validated by assessing its effectiveness at the country level in comparison with an international publicly available data privacy benchmark."
9000127,Is Backside the New Backdoor in Modern SoCs?: Invited Paper,"Modern integrated circuits (ICs) possess several countermeasures to safeguard sensitive data and information stored in the device. In recent years, semi-invasive physical attacks based on optical debugging techniques have proven to be capable of easily bypassing these security measures implemented in the chip. Optical attacks can reveal the data stored in memory, cache and register through various methods such as photon emission analysis, laser fault injection, laser voltage probing, and thermal laser stimulation. The above-mentioned methods, which employ laser scanning microscopy and photon emission microscopy, are effective because the silicon substrate is transparent to near-infrared (NIR) photons. Therefore, the most vulnerable part of an IC to optical attacks is the backside, where the chip's transistors can be accessed and probed with a NIR laser beam. Although different optical attack detection and avoidance mechanisms have been proposed, many can be circumvented and none are universal solutions for all types of optical attacks. In this study, we present a taxonomy of the different types of optical attacks and the security threats posed by each type. Then we discuss the existing prevention-detection based solutions to optical probing attacks which will set the future research direction."

While enjoying the convenience brought by IoT, we also face unprecedented challenges including ubiquitous and unpredictable demands for communication and computing resources. In consideration of their flexible deployment, low cost, and easy expansion, UAV edge computing IoT networks (UECIN), which adopt UAVs to provide fast communication and computing services, have emerged as a promising solution. Note that there have been a number of studies focusing on UAV’s position deployment and trajectory design, resource allocation in UECIN. However, most existing works proposed short-term service provisioning systems with a fixed number of UAVs, ignoring the problem of UAVs’ limited battery power and the possible changes of ground users’ number, locations and resource requirements. To address these issues, we present a dynamic UECIN framework with autonomous prediction characteristics, aiming to stably provide mobile edge computing services for ground users in a certain area over a long period of time. This framework cannot only support UAV’s dynamic entry and exit according to the real-time needs of ground users, but also update their position deployment based on the distribution of ground users. As we know, we are the first to propose UECIN with a dynamic entry and exit mechanism. Besides, an efficient and load-balancing task allocation scheme is further given, and extensive analysis and numerical results corroborate the feasibility and superior performance of our framework."
9018029,Achieving O(log³n) Communication-Efficient Privacy-Preserving Range Query in Fog-Based IoT,"The advance of Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques has promoted an increasing number of organizations to explore more mission-critical solutions. However, the response latency, bandwidth usage, and reliability are still challenging issues in the traditional IoT. To tackle these challenges, the fog-based IoT has become popular and the range query is one of the most frequently used operations in fog-based IoT, where given a range query, a fog node will return the aggregated data from IoT devices to the query user. Because the fog nodes are not fully trusted, there is a desire to design a privacy-preserving range query scheme in the fog-based IoT. However, most of existing privacy-preserving range query schemes are not efficient in terms of communication overhead, especially for a large-size range. Therefore, it is still a challenging issue to design a communication-efficient range query in fog-based IoT. Aiming at this challenge, in this article, we propose a new privacy-preserving range query scheme in the fog-based IoT. Specifically, we first devise an efficient homomorphic encryption scheme for maintaining data privacy and security in a range query. Then, we present a novel range decomposition technique to compile the range query, which can transform a given range query [L, U], where 0 ≤ L ≤ U ≤ n - 1, into a semi-triangular structure, and enable our proposed scheme to achieve O(log 3 n) communication efficiency. The detailed security analysis shows that our proposed scheme is really privacy preserving, and the extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of low communication overhead and the computational cost."
9116489,Poisoning the (Data) Well in ML-Based CAD: A Case Study of Hiding Lithographic Hotspots,"Machine learning (ML) provides state-of-the-art performance in many parts of computer-aided design (CAD) flows. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to various adversarial attacks, including data poisoning to compromise training to insert backdoors. Sensitivity to training data integrity presents a security vulnerability, especially in light of malicious insiders who want to cause targeted neural network misbehavior. In this study, we explore this threat in lithographic hotspot detection via training data poisoning, where hotspots in a layout clip can be ""hidden"" at inference time by including a trigger shape in the input. We show that training data poisoning attacks are feasible and stealthy, demonstrating a backdoored neural network that performs normally on clean inputs but misbehaves on inputs when a backdoor trigger is present. Furthermore, our results raise some fundamental questions about the robustness of ML-based systems in CAD."
9136610,Improving text recognition in Tor darknet with rectification and super-resolution techniques,"Text recognition can be used to retrieve textual information embedded in images. This task can be complex due to the low-resolution of the images and the orientation of the text, which are problems commonly found in Tor darknet images. In this work, we combine three different super-resolution algorithms, together with a rectification network, to increase the performance in the text recognition step. We evaluated these combinations in four state-of-the-art datasets, and in TOICO-1K, a Tor-based image dataset which was semi-automatically labelled for the task of Text Spotting in Tor darknet. We obtained the highest performance increase in ICDAR 2015 dataset, with an improvement of 3.77% when combining Residual Dense and the rectification networks. In TOICO-1K, we achieved a 3.41% of improvement when we combined Deep CNN and the rectification network. Our conclusion is that rectification performs slightly better than super-resolution when they are applied standalone, while their combination obtains the best results in the datasets evaluated."
8721046,Subversion in Practice: How to Efficiently Undermine Signatures,"Algorithm substitution attack (ASA) on signatures can have severe consequences as the authentication services of numerous systems and applications rely on signature schemes. In this paper, we present a highly efficient ASA on the widely-used digital signature algorithm (DSA). Compared with the generic ASAs on signature schemes proposed in the literature, our attack provides fast and undetectable subversion, which can extract the user's private signing key by collecting the maximum three signatures arbitrarily. Moreover, our ASA is proven to be robust against state reset. We implemented the proposed ASA by replacing the original DSA in Libgcrypt (a popular cryptographic library used in many applications) with our subverted DSA. Our experiment shows that the user's private key can readily be recovered once the subverted DSA is used to sign messages. In our implementation, various measures have been considered to significantly reduce the possibility of detection through comparing the running time of the original DSA and the subverted one (i.e. timing analysis). To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of the ASA in practice, which shows that the ASA is a real threat rather than only theoretical speculation."

It was demonstrated that HTM produces a good performance in predicting unusual patterns or anomaly detection in univariate datasets. In this paper, we deploy the HTM algorithm for the anomaly detection problem in multivariate datasets, which are more common in practical scenarios. We first investigate the implementation of HTM using multi-encoders for multiple variables and analyze its performance in different parameter settings. Then, we introduce a new framework for ensemble learning by using single-encoder HTMs as weak learners. We carried out experiments on public datasets in different dimensions. Our experimental results show that our new approach outperforms the multi-encoder implementation of the HTM algorithm."

9222523,Anti-Honeypot Enabled Optimal Attack Strategy for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems,"Honeypots have been widely used in the security community to understand the cyber threat landscape, for example to study unauthorized penetration attempts targeting industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) and observing the behaviors in such activities. However, some better-resourced cyber attackers may attempt to identify honeypots and develop strategies to compromise them, aka anti-honeypot. In this paper, we present an anti-honeypot enabled optimal attack strategy for ICPS, by employing a novel game-theoretical approach. Specifically, the interactions between the attacker and ICPS defender are captured with a proposed hybrid signaling and repeated game, i.e., a non-cooperative two-player one-shot game with incomplete information. By taking into account both various possible defenses of an ICPS and diverse offensive acts of attackers, a Nash equilibrium is derived, which exhibits an optimal attack strategy for attackers with varying technical sophistication. Extensive simulation experiments on multiple test cases demonstrate that, the derived strategy offers the attackers an optimal tactic to compromise the target ICPS protected by honeypots, while having only incomplete knowledge of the defensive mechanisms."
9667306,Inter-Server Collaborative Federated Learning for Ultra-Dense Edge Computing,"Increasingly serious data security and privacy protection issues make federated learning (FL) gradually evolve to be an important technology in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, in consideration of the huge demands for network access and computing resources from massive IoT devices, ultra-dense edge computing (UDEC), which integrates mobile edge computing (MEC) and ultra-dense network (UDN), has turned out to be a promising network architecture in the era of 5G and even 6G. Facing requirements on ultra-low processing latency, performing FL for UDEC confronts many challenges, one of which is how to relieve the barrel effect caused by the difference in computing power of local devices while ensuring overall FL efficiency. Nevertheless, little work can be found in this area. Toward this end, the paper takes the lead in studying FL for UDEC, and proposes an inter-server collaborative federated learning method by grouping the servers and clients. Theoretical analysis and numerical results corroborate that our proposed inter-server collaborative method can significantly reduce the waiting time during local training without reducing the learning accuracy, thus improving the overall efficiency."
9195012,DeepFed: Federated Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection in Industrial Cyber–Physical Systems,"The rapid convergence of legacy industrial infrastructures with intelligent networking and computing technologies (e.g., 5G, software-defined networking, and artificial intelligence), have dramatically increased the attack surface of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs). However, withstanding cyber threats to such large-scale, complex, and heterogeneous industrial CPSs has been extremely challenging, due to the insufficiency of high-quality attack examples. In this article, we propose a novel federated deep learning scheme, named DeepFed, to detect cyber threats against industrial CPSs. Specifically, we first design a new deep learning-based intrusion detection model for industrial CPSs, by making use of a convolutional neural network and a gated recurrent unit. Second, we develop a federated learning framework, allowing multiple industrial CPSs to collectively build a comprehensive intrusion detection model in a privacy-preserving way. Further, a Paillier cryptosystem-based secure communication protocol is crafted to preserve the security and privacy of model parameters through the training process. Extensive experiments on a real industrial CPS dataset demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed DeepFed scheme in detecting various types of cyber threats to industrial CPSs and the superiorities over state-of-the-art schemes."

8939256,SoliAudit: Smart Contract Vulnerability Assessment Based on Machine Learning and Fuzz Testing,"Blockchain has flourished in recent years. As a decentralized system architecture, smart contracts give the blockchain a user-defined logical concept. The smart contract is an executable program that can be used for automatic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, the DAO attack resulted in the theft of 60M USD due to unsafe smart contracts. Smart contracts are vulnerable to hacking because they are difficult to patch and there is a lack of assessment standards for ensuring their quality. Hackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in smart contracts when they have been published on Ethereum. Thus, this study presents SoliAudit (Solidity Audit), which uses machine learning and fuzz testing for smart contract vulnerability assessment. SoliAudit employs machine learning technology using Solidity machine code as learning features to verify 13 kinds of vulnerabilities, which have been listed as Top 10 threats by an open security organization. We also created a gray-box fuzz testing mechanism, which consists of a fuzzer contract and a simulated blockchain environment for on-line transaction verification. Different from previous research systems, SoliAudit can detect vulnerabilities without expert knowledge or predefined patterns. We subjected SoliAudit to real-world evaluation by using near 18k smart contracts from the Ethereum blockchain and Capture-the-Flag samples. The results show that the accuracy of SoliAudit can reach to 90% and the fuzzing can help identify potential weaknesses, including reentrancy and arithmetic overflow problems."

LoRa technology is used for communication to long distances at a low cost of power consumption. This protocol is able to transfer tiny amounts or a few bytes of data over the network effectively at a regular time interval. Several previous works focus on the performance analysis compared to the security of the protocol. LoRaWAN v1.1 has been significant development to the protocol definition and some new security-related features and improvements. But, some vulnerability still exists in the previous version has not been mitigated. This project paper discusses in detail about the Man in the Middle (MitM) attack taking place in LoRaWAN physical layer during the encrypted communication between two peer modules over the wireless network. The attacker is able to capture, analyse, decode and modify the data (payload). As a proof of concept, the attack is carried out on a controlled LoRaWAN environment using the testbed. A novel mitigation technique is proposed against the attack by a GCM cryptographic algorithm implementation so that the attacks can be mitigated. Finally, the mitigation technique is implemented, tested and the results are presented."
8955840,Android Malware Familial Classification Based on DEX File Section Features,"The rapid proliferation of Android malware is challenging the classification of the Android malware family. The traditional static method for classification is easily affected by the confusion and reinforcement, while the dynamic method is expensive in computation. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an Android malware familial classification method based on Dalvik Executable (DEX) file section features. First, the DEX file is converted into RGB (Red/Green/Blue) image and plain text respectively, and then, the color and texture of image and text are extracted as features. Finally, a feature fusion algorithm based on multiple kernel learning is used for classification. In this experiment, the Android Malware Dataset (AMD) was selected as the sample set. Two different comparative experiments were set up, and the method in this paper was compared with the common visualization method and feature fusion method. The results show that our method has a better classification effect with precision, recall and F1 score reaching 0.96. Besides, the time of feature extraction in this paper is reduced by 2.999 seconds compared with the method of frequent subsequence. In conclusion, the method proposed in this paper is efficient and precise in the classification of the Android malware family."

However, many app descriptions do not reflect app functionalities, whether accidentally or on purpose. Most importantly, these app classification methods do not work if the app description is unavailable. This paper investigates a Reverse Engineering-based Approach to Classify mobile apps using The data that exists in the app, called REACT. To validate the proposed REACT method, we use a large set of Android apps (24,652 apps in total). We also show REACTs' extendibility for malware/anomaly detection and prove its reliability and scalability. However, our analysis shows some limitations in REACT procedure and implementation, especially for similar feature based app grouping. We discuss the root cause of these failures, our key lessons learned, and some future enhancement ideas. We also share our REACT tools and reproduced datasets for the app market analyst, mobile app developers and software engineering research communities for further research purposes."

The experimental data is the dense point cloud model scanned by a 3D scanner. According to the characteristics of the model data, this paper proposes a dense point cloud foot model extraction method based on Euclidean distance, that is, judge the adjacent points of the dense point cloud data based on Euclidean distance, identify the redundant parts outside the foot model, and then extract the foot model. The results show that this method can identify the redundant part well, and the extracted foot model is also effective."
9104640,Black-Box Accountable Authority Identity-Based Revocation System,"Identity-based revocation system (IBRS) generates the ciphertext with a revoked identity list such that only the non-revoked identities can use their private keys to decrypt this ciphertext. IBRS can be efficiently applied in some practical applications, such as the pay-TV systems when the number of revoked identities are much less than the non-revoked ones. However, since IBRS is based on identity-based cryptography, it also suffers from the inherent key escrow problem where the private key generator (PKG) has full control of each user's private key. As a consequence, it is hard to judge whether a pirated private key is generated by the PKG or the suspected user. There is no study on IBRS fulfilling accountability in literature to date. In this paper, we introduce the notion of accountable authority IBRS (A-IBRS), which provides accountability in IBRS schemes. In an A-IBRS, the aforementioned problem can be alleviated and resolved. Furthermore, a full black-box A-IBRS can distinguish the creator of a black box between the PKG and the associated user and the dishonest PKG is allowed to access the decryption results of the user private key. We formalize the definition and security models of the full black-box A-IBRS schemes. Then, we present a concrete full black-box A-IBRS scheme with constant-size master public key and private key. Finally, we prove the security of our scheme under the defined security models without random oracle."

9241734,PhantomFS-v2: Dare You to Avoid This Trap,"It has been demonstrated that deception technologies are effective in detecting advanced persistent threats and zero-day attacks which cannot be detected by traditional signature-based intrusion detection techniques. Especially, a file-based deception technology is promising because it is very difficult (if not impossible) to commit an attack without reading and modifying any file. It can play as an additional security barrier because malicious file access can be detected even if an adversary succeeds in gaining access to a host. However, PhantomFS still has a problem that is common to deception technologies. Once a deception technology is known to adversaries, it is unlikely to succeed in alluring adversaries. In this paper, we classify adversaries who are aware of PhantomFS according to their knowledge level and permission of PhantomFS. Then we analyze the attack surface and develop a defense strategy to limit the attack vectors. We extend PhantomFS to realize the strategy. Specifically, we introduce multiple hidden interfaces and detection of file execution. We evaluate the security and performance overhead of the proposed technique. We demonstrate that the extended PhantomFS is secure against intelligent adversaries by penetration testing. The extended PhantomFS offers higher detection accuracy with lower false alarm rate compared to existing techniques. It is also demonstrated that the overhead is negligible in terms of response time and CPU time."
9585508,Fast and Accurate Likelihood Ratio-Based Biometric Verification Secure Against Malicious Adversaries,"Biometric verification has been widely deployed in current authentication solutions as it proves the physical presence of individuals. Several solutions have been developed to protect the sensitive biometric data in such systems that provide security against honest-but-curious (a.k.a. semi-honest) attackers. However, in practice, attackers typically do not act honestly and multiple studies have shown severe biometric information leakage in such honest-but-curious solutions when considering dishonest, malicious attackers. In this paper, we propose a provably secure biometric verification protocol to withstand malicious attackers and prevent biometric data from any leakage. The proposed protocol is based on a homomorphically encrypted log likelihood-ratio (HELR) classifier that supports any biometric modality (e.g., face, fingerprint, dynamic signature, etc.) encoded as a fixed-length real-valued feature vector. The HELR classifier performs an accurate and fast biometric recognition. Furthermore, our protocol, which is secure against malicious adversaries, is designed from a protocol secure against semi-honest adversaries enhanced by zero-knowledge proofs. We evaluate both protocols for various security levels and record a sub-second speed (between 0.37s and 0.88s) for the protocol secure against semi-honest adversaries and between 0.95s and 2.50s for the protocol secure against malicious adversaries."
9300258,The Key is Left under the Mat: On the Inappropriate Security Assumption of Logic Locking Schemes,"Logic locking has been proposed as an obfuscation technique to protect outsourced IC designs from IP piracy by untrusted entities in the design and fabrication process. In this case, the netlist is locked by adding extra key-gates, and will be unlocked only if a correct key is applied to the key-gates. The key is assumed to be written into a non-volatile memory after the fabrication by the IP owner. In the past several years, the focus of the research community has been mostly on Oracle-guided attacks, such as SAT attacks, on logic locking and proposing proper countermeasures against such attacks. However, none of the reported research in the literature has ever challenged a more fundamental assumption of logic locking, which is the security of the key itself. In other words, if an adversary can read out the correct key after insertion, the security of the entire scheme is broken. In this work, we first review possible adversaries for the locked circuits and their capabilities. Afterward, we demonstrate that even with the assumption of having a tamper- and read-proof memory for the key storage, which is not vulnerable to any physical attacks, the key transfer between the memory and the key-gates through registers and buffers make the key extraction by an adversary possible. To support our claim, we implemented a proof-of-concept locked circuit as well as one of the standard logic locking benchmarks on an FPGA manufactured with a 28 nm technology and extract obfuscation keys using optical probing. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of the proposed attack in different scenarios and propose potential countermeasures."
9728949,Attack Tactic Labeling for Cyber Threat Hunting,"Recently, the cyber attack has become more complex and targeted, making traditional security defense mechanisms based on the “Indicator of Compromise” ineffective. Furthermore, fail to consider attack kill chain may lead to a high false-positive rate for attack detection. To trace hackers’ behaviors and footprints, it is crucial to provide additional information such as attack tactics, techniques, and procedures in detecting attacks. In this study, we propose a mechanism for labeling attack tactics of network intrusion detection system (NIDS) rules on the basis of text mining and machine learning. The proposed approach can help security experts determine the current attack state and infer its purpose, making it possible to detect complex attacks (e.g., APT). Besides, we refer to the ATT&CK framework developed by MITRE (a leading organization in information security) to strengthen the reliability of labeling results. The experiment result shows that the accuracy of our proposed mechanism can effectively boost the performance of the labeling attack tactic. The experimental result shows that the F1 score of our approach is more than 90% and up to approximately 96%, which can effectively assist cyber security experts in tactic labeling and provides a solid base for further alert correlation. Moreover, we also compare our approach with one of the well-known TTP labeling tools, rcATT; the result shows that our approach’s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are all significantly better than rcATT."
9085171,An Explainable Method of Phishing Emails Generation and Its Application in Machine Learning,"The fact that phishing emails cannot be released because they contain private information greatly hinders researchers from obtaining large-scale samples of real phishing emails. At the same time, the legal email data set is often collected from a certain field, which is quite different from the phishing samples, and it is easy to cause overfitting or spatial bias during the process of building the model. This paper proposes a method for generating phishing emails based on data insertion, which can increase the number of phishing samples without changing the malicious attributes, solve the problem of spatial bias during model training, and can reduce the difference in statistical characteristics between benign and malicious samples to a certain extent. Based on the differences in the email HTML content of the Phishing dataset and the Enron dataset, this paper implements six resource generators and a communication relationship selector. It controls the generation of new samples by implementing control-quantity sequence pairs, and proposes quantitative evaluation methods and indicators of the classifier's generalization ability, and verified that the newly generated samples can be used to train a classifier with stronger generalization ability. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a method to provide the model with higher quality data."

These urged both researchers and practitioner to secure the cyberspace at the very root point, which refer to as the endpoint. The detection and response at endpoint must be able to protect at real-time as good as the attacker. In this paper, we reviewed the techniques used in endpoint detection and response. We discovered the trend have shifted from the traditional approaches to more intelligent way. Specifically, most proposed techniques focused on machine learnings. We also zoomed into these techniques and outline the advantages of these techniques."

This paper proves that the character social networks of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings are small-world and scale-free and not only preferential attachment but also some specific plots affect the development of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. That means the social networks from two literatures obey the complex network theories that the social networks in real word follow. Hence, these above properties make the two fictional novels' networks more like networks in the real world and make people accept them well."
8888419,Developing Realistic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack Dataset and Taxonomy,"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a menace to network security that aims at exhausting the target networks with malicious traffic. Although many statistical methods have been designed for DDoS attack detection, designing a real-time detector with low computational overhead is still one of the main concerns. On the other hand, the evaluation of new detection algorithms and techniques heavily relies on the existence of well-designed datasets. In this paper, first, we review the existing datasets comprehensively and propose a new taxonomy for DDoS attacks. Secondly, we generate a new dataset, namely CICDDoS2019, which remedies all current shortcomings. Thirdly, using the generated dataset, we propose a new detection and family classificaiton approach based on a set of network flow features. Finally, we provide the most important feature sets to detect different types of DDoS attacks with their corresponding weights."

Fundamental to these tools are effective models for accurately measuring the propagation of information and calculating metadata. In this work, we formalize a unified model for reasoning about taint- and X-propagation behaviors and verifying design properties related to these behaviors. Our model are developed from the perspective of information flow and can be described using standard hardware description language (HDL), which allows formal verification of both taint-propagation (i.e., security) and X-propagation (i.e., reliability) related properties using standard electronic design automation (EDA) verification tools.

However, due to low-resource and poor computing capability, these devices have a high number of firmware vulnerabilities. Software verification is a powerful solution to ensure the correctness and security of IoT firmware programs. Unfortunately, due to the complex semantics and syntax of program languages (typically C), applying software verification in IoT firmware faces the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. One of the fundamental reasons is that verification methods cannot support verifying state transitions on the memory space caused by pointer operations well. To this end, by combining sparse value flow analysis into model checking and optimizing computational redundancy among them, we design a novel points-to-sensitive model checker, called Pchecker, which can provide a highly precise and efficient verification for IoT firmware programs. We firstly design a spatial flow model to effectively describe state behaviors of a C program both on the symbolic and memory space. We then propose a counterexample-guided model checking algorithm that can dynamically refine abstract precisions and update non-deterministic points-to relations. With a set of C benchmarks containing a variety of pointer operations and other complex C features, our experiments have shown that compared with state of the art, Pchecker can achieve outstanding results in the verification tasks of C programs that its verification accuracy is 95.9%, and its average verification time of each line of code is 1.27 milliseconds, which are both better than existing model checkers."

China needs to realize the importance of digital rights, which is more conducive to the development of ultra-high-definition digital services in China. Therefore, this paper will introduce the architecture of China digital rights management (ChinaDRM) and its application in TS encapsulation format. In the meantime, we proposed an analytical method about the TS bitstream which had been encrypted. In the TS bitstream, it also carried the ChinaDRM descriptor and Content Encryption Information (CEI). Finally, we designed a bitstream parsing system to parse the data of CEI and ChinaDRM descriptor."
9432664,Anonymous Fair Auction on Blockchain,"Online auction systems allow to achieve an optimal trading of digital goods and services in a competitive market. Existing blockchain-based auctions allow the bidders to take part in the process while maintaining the confidentiality of their bids in a decentralized, transparent, secure and auditable way. However, in a competitive market, parties would prefer not to disclose their interests to competitors, and to remain anonymous during auctions. In this paper, we firstly analyze the specific requirements for blockchain-based anonymous fair auctions. We propose a formal model tailored to study auction systems facilitating anonymity, and we put forward a generic protocol relying on existing cryptographic primitives, such as designated verifier ring signature, to achieve bid confidentiality and bidder anonymity. Finally, we prove it to be secure against the security model we defined. Index Terms-blockchain, auction, anonymity, designated identity verifier ring signature."

The auto-tuning algorithm of the PID controller based on one machine learning method, which is equivalent to the steepest descent, is proposed. A feature of the proposed approach is the vector adjustment of the PID controller parameters, where the angular direction of descent is taken into account at first, and the step sizes are made if taking into account the increased accuracy of the approximation near the optimum point. Modeling performed in the Matlab environment confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
9552882,Improving Performance of Autoencoder-Based Network Anomaly Detection on NSL-KDD Dataset,"Network anomaly detection plays a crucial role as it provides an effective mechanism to block or stop cyberattacks. With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), there has been a number of Autoencoder (AE) based deep learning approaches for network anomaly detection to improve our posture towards network security. The performance of existing state-of-the-art AE models used for network anomaly detection varies without offering a holistic approach to understand the critical impacts of the core set of important performance indicators of AE models and the detection accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel 5-layer autoencoder (AE)-based model better suited for network anomaly detection tasks. Our proposal is based on the results we obtained through an extensive and rigorous investigation of several performance indicators involved in an AE model. In our proposed model, we use a new data pre-processing methodology that transforms and removes the most affected outliers from the input samples to reduce model bias caused by data imbalance across different data types in the feature set. Our proposed model utilizes the most effective reconstruction error function which plays an essential role for the model to decide whether a network traffic sample is normal or anomalous. These sets of innovative approaches and the optimal model architecture allow our model to be better equipped for feature learning and dimension reduction thus producing better detection accuracy as well as f1-score. We evaluated our proposed model on the NSL-KDD dataset which outperformed other similar methods by achieving the highest accuracy and f1-score at 90.61% and 92.26% respectively in detection."
9452028,VolMemLyzer: Volatile Memory Analyzer for Malware Classification using Feature Engineering,"Memory forensics is a fundamental step that inspects malicious activities during live malware infection. Memory analysis not only captures malware footprints but also collects several essential features that may be used to extract hidden original code from obfuscated malware. There are significant efforts in analyzing volatile memory using several tools and approaches. These approaches fetch relevant information from the kernel and user space of the operating system to investigate running malware. However, the fetching process will accelerate if the most dominating features required for malware classification are readily available. This paper introduces VolMemLyzer, a python-based tool developed to excerpt the most critical characterization feature set from the memory dumps taken during live malware infection. It extracts thirty-six most essential features and ranks them to classify malware. The tool is tested with a dataset of 1900 benign and malware samples with high true positive rate for binary and multi-class malware classification."
9250906,A novel Network-on-Chip security algorithm for tolerating Byzantine faults,"Since the number of processors and cores on a single chip is increasing, the interconnection among them becomes significant. Network-on-Chip (NoC) has direct access to all resources and information within a System-on-Chip (SoC), rendering it appealing to attackers. Malicious attacks targeting NoC are a major cause of performance depletion and they can cause arbitrary behavior of links or routers, that is, Byzantine faults. Byzantine faults have been thoroughly investigated in the context of Distributed systems however not in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. Hence, in this paper we propose a novel fault model followed by the design and implementation of lightweight algorithms, based on Software Defined Network-on-Chip (SDNoC) architecture. The proposed algorithms can be used to build highly available NoCs and can tolerate Byzantine faults. Additionally, a set of different scenarios has been simulated and the results demonstrate that by using the proposed algorithms the packet loss decreases between 65% and 76% under Transpose traffic, 67% and 77% under BitReverse and 55% and 66% under Uniform traffic."
8852950,Privacy-Preserving Aggregation of Time-Series Data with Public Verifiability from Simple Assumptions and Its Implementations,"Aggregator oblivious encryption was proposed by Shi et al. (NDSS 2011). In this method, an aggregator can compute an aggregated sum of data and is unable to learn anything else (aggregator obliviousness). Since the aggregator does not learn individual data that may reveal users’ habits and behaviors, several applications including privacy-preserving smart metering have been considered. In this paper, we propose an aggregator oblivious encryption scheme with public verifiability where the aggregator is required to generate a proof of an aggregated sum, and anyone can verify whether the aggregated sum has been correctly computed by the aggregator. Although Leontiadis et al. (CANS 2015) considered verifiability, their scheme requires an interactive complexity assumption to provide the unforgeability of the proof. Our scheme is proven to be unforgeable under a static and simple assumption (a variant of the Computational Diffie–Hellman assumption). Moreover, our scheme inherits the tightness of the reduction of the Benhamouda et al. scheme (ACM TISSEC 2016) for proving aggregator obliviousness. This tight reduction allows us to employ elliptic curves of a smaller order and leads to efficient implementation. Specifically, for 112-bit security, we can employ Barreto–Naehrig (BN) curves with a 383-bit prime order, whereas we need to employ curves with a 1031-bit prime order to implement the Leontiadis et al. scheme. We give implementations of two schemes and evaluate their performances under those curves. We employ a Raspberry-Pi as a power-constrained device such as a smart meter. Consequently, we demonstrate that the running time of the data encryption, data aggregation and verification in our scheme are reduced by approximately 74%, 64% and 89%, respectively, compared to those of the Leontiadis et al. scheme."
9226543,On Optical Attacks Making Logic Obfuscation Fragile,"The backside of modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) is becoming an open backdoor for malicious hardware attackers to take advantage of. Aided by new Failure Analysis (FA) optical techniques, e.g., Photon Emission Analysis (PEA), optical probing, and Laser Fault Injection (LFI), hackers pose a serious threat to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive information on a chip. In addition, optical backside attacks can risk semiconductor intellectual property (IP) protection mechanisms, such as logic locking. In this work, we review some of these failure analysis techniques through the lens of Optical Attack. We also review combinational and sequential Logic Locking, and then focus on corresponding state space obfuscation methodology. Attack procedures are then described on how to break into these obfuscation systems, and finally, existing countermeasures and their limitations are discussed."

We propose employing a deep convolutional signal to noise ratio estimation model to exploit relationships within signals of similar signal to noise ratio ranges through signal to noise ratio specific modulation classifiers. We utilize a two-stage process where the signal to noise ratio is first estimated and then demultiplexed into a modulation classifier that has been tuned on signals with similar signal to noise ratios. Using the proposed method, we build upon the current state-of-the-art and increase classification performance at decreasing signal to noise ratios."
9357602,Lightweight Blockchain-based Platform for GDPR-Compliant Personal Data Management,"New digital technologies generate large amounts of information. This data is processed by Service Providers in order to improve and develop new services or products, but also to fund themselves. However, processing these personal data can result in the extraction of sensitive information. In consequence, it can lead to users' privacy risk. To mitigate this risk, the EU elaborated the GDPR. It forces Service Providers to have Data Subjects' explicit consent for collecting and processing their personal data. The problem is that legislative text does not define how to transparently demonstrate that they already have this consent. Also, most users do not know the rights they have over their personal data, neither this regulation provides techniques for them to be aware about what happens with it. In this paper, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based GDPR-compliant personal data management platform. It provides public access to immutable evidences that show the agreements between the Data Subjects and Service Providers. The Service Providers can demonstrate that they are fulfilling the regulation, and Data Subjects are aware about what happens with their personal data and can manage it according to their rights."
9205087,Detecting Malicious TLS Network Traffic Based on Communication Channel Features,"For highly camouflaged Command and Control (C&C) communications, especially those using the Transport Security Layer (TLS) protocol, traditional classifiers which only based on statistical features or TLS handshake features gradually fail to detect such behavior. In this context, exploring features of other dimensions to build a more targeted recognition model is one of the ways to alleviate this problem. This paper proposed a new method of detecting malicious TLS traffic by using the communication channel as the detection unit, and a new set of modeling features for the communication channel was designed, including distribution features, the consistency features and statistical features of TLS communication channel. Experiments show that compared with other two types of features, the consistency features contribute most, and combining these three types of features together can train a better classifier which the precision reaches 92.57%. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method is more advantageous when faced with highly camouflaged TLS flows because the proposed method also achieved highest F1 score, and the accuracy is about 2% higher than the classifier based on the TLS handshake features, and 12% higher than the clustering model based on the statistical features of flow."

How to do a good job in the security protection of industrial control systems is extremely urgent. For traditional network security, industrial control systems have some unique characteristics, which results in traditional intrusion detection systems that cannot be directly reused on it. Aiming at the industrial control system, this paper constructs all attack paths from the hacker's perspective through the attack tree model, and uses the LSTM algorithm to identify and classify the attack behavior, and then further classify the attack event by extracting atomic actions. Finally, through the constructed attack tree model, the results are reversed and predicted. The results show that the model has a good effect on attack recognition, and can effectively analyze the hacker attack path and predict the next attack target."
9674133,A Cross-Chain Solutions Based On Proxy Network,"Most of the current research on cross-chain technology focuses on the efficiency and security of currency transactions, which cannot be well applied to the non-financial field of storing large-volume engineering documents and data. Cross-chain supervision and storage is more difficult, and data structure conversion is complicated. To solve these problems, this paper applies node performance index and identity evaluation techniques to engineering document data cross-linking, and proposes a cross-linking scheme of the agent network.

Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional consensus mechanisms in the application of power system engineering management, this article improves the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm based on the reputation value. First, according to different business environments, design the corresponding credit value influencing factors, and then use each influencing factor as input, and use the random forest algorithm to classify the nodes into three node clusters based on the reputation value of high, medium, and low. Election of the master node is carried out in the high reputation value node cluster and the continuous election of the master node is suppressed, and the low reputation value cluster is detected to find possible malicious nodes. The simulation experiment results show that the master nodes are more secure and evenly distributed; at the same time, malicious nodes in the system can be found to ensure system stability."

9172864,Detecting DNS Tunnels Using Session Behavior and Random Forest Method,"DNS server is one of the most important Internet infrastructures in modern society. DNS Tunnel technology is firstly used to get free WiFi, more and more security incidents using DNS protocol to transmit information or illegal commands in recently advanced persistent threat attacks. Most security products such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems rarely detect DNS communication, which provides naturally command and control communication channel for attackers. The traditional detection methods only focus on the network communication feature for DNS tunnel tools, such as iodine, dnscat2 and dns2tcp. Then many machine learning detection methods are introduced to automatically learn the abstract features and classify the illegal communication method, but the detection result is not still satisfied with high accurate and low false positive. In order to solve this issue, the paper proposed an automatically detecting methods based on session behaviors and random forest algorithm. The experiments proved the method could achieve high accuracy (99.79%) with recall (98.67%), which is higher than other general algorithms."
9449915,Identity-Based Linkable Ring Signatures From Lattices,"Linkable ring signatures is a useful cryptographic tool for constructing applications such as ones relative to electronic voting (e-voting), digital cashes (e-cashes) as well as cloud computing. Equipped with linkable ring signatures, e-voting, e-cash systems can simultaneously enjoy the privacy and the unreusability properties thanks to the anonymity and the linkability of linkable ring signatures. Likewise, cloud servers can enjoy a privacy-preserving ability, a flexible access control and an efficient security management with linkable ring signatures. Moreover, linkable ring signatures built in the identity-based setting would help to remove the expense of using the conventional public key infrastructure and also could be applied to the user management. This primitive hence would be suitable for huge-scale applications. In this paper, we present the first identity-based linkable ring signatures (IdLRS) in both integer lattice and ideal lattice setting. The proposed IdLRS is proved secure in the random oracle model and based on the hardness of the short integer solution and ring short integer solution assumption. We also implement the proposed idLRS as a proof of concept and then do some experiments to evaluate the running times and the sizes."
8960303,A Neural Network-Based Approach for Cryptographic Function Detection in Malware,"Cryptographic technology has been commonly used in malware for hiding their static characteristics and malicious behaviors to avoid the detection of anti-virus engines and counter the reverse analysis from security researchers. The detection of cryptographic functions in an effective way in malware has vital significance for malicious code detection and deep analysis. Many efforts have been made to solve this issue, while existing methods suffer from some issues, such as unable to achieve promising results in accuracy, limited by prior knowledge, and have a high overhead. In this paper, we draw on the idea of text classification in the field of natural language processing and propose a novel neural network to detect the type of cryptographic functions. The new network is an end-2-end model which includes two important modules: Instruction-2-vec and K-Max-CNN-Attention. The Instruction-2-vec model extracts the “words” of assembly instructions and transfers them into continuous vectors. The K-Max-CNN-Attention is used to encode the instruction vectors and generate the representation of the function. And we designed a softmax classifier to predict the categories of the functions. Extensive experiments were conducted on a collected dataset which contains 15 common types of cryptographic functions extracted from malware, to assess the validity of the proposed approach. The experiment results showed that the proposed approach archives a better performance than the recent embedding network SAFE with the Precision, Recall and F1-score of 0.9349, 0.8933 and 0.9020, respectively. We also compared it with four widely-used tools, the results demonstrated that our approach is much better in accuracy and effectiveness than all of them."

9471821,De-Anonymisation Attacks on Tor: A Survey,"Anonymity networks are becoming increasingly popular in today’s online world as more users attempt to safeguard their online privacy. Tor is currently the most popular anonymity network in use and provides anonymity to both users and services (hidden services). However, the anonymity provided by Tor is also being misused in various ways. Hosting illegal sites for selling drugs, hosting command and control servers for botnets, and distributing censored content are but a few such examples. As a result, various parties, including governments and law enforcement agencies, are interested in attacks that assist in de-anonymising the Tor network, disrupting its operations, and bypassing its censorship circumvention mechanisms. In this survey paper, we review known Tor attacks and identify current techniques for the de-anonymisation of Tor users and hidden services. We discuss these techniques and analyse the practicality of their execution method. We conclude by discussing improvements to the Tor framework that help prevent the surveyed de-anonymisation attacks."
9516772,Stealing Machine Learning Parameters via Side Channel Power Attacks,"Side-channel attacks target system implementation statistics, such as the electricity required to run a cryptographic function. Deriving cryptographic keys, such as AES keys, has become such a simplified process that extracting sensitive information from an otherwise secure algorithm requires only a $35USD microcontroller. While cryptographic algorithms indicate the presence of sensitive data, making them a preferable target, other systems hold valuable data with significantly less protection. Due to the ubiquity and rigidity of machine learning algorithms, the ability to infer model parameters has drastic security implications. This investigation extracted information from machine learning models through the use of traditional side-channel techniques. Specifically, a side-channel power analysis was performed using a ChipWhisperer Lite to extract information from Neural Networks and Linear Regression models running on a target microcontroller. Then, time series classification tasks were performed on the resultant power traces to determine the differences between the two models and their varied hyperparameters. Three such classification tasks were tested. In the first, a neural network was differentiated from a linear regression model with 100% accuracy. In the second, two neural networks with different sized hidden layers are classified with 97.92% accuracy. In the third, two virtually identical linear regression models are compared that differ only in the initial value of one hyperparameter. These models were only classified with 67.92% accuracy. Although the accuracy decreases as the models become more alike, these results indicate that machine learning model parameters can be inferred from power-based side-channel attacks."

However, the fusion of heterogeneous IoE communication networks creates a new threat landscape. To thwart and mitigate various types of cyber threats to IoE networks, this paper proposes a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) based on a designed residual network with attention long short term memory (ReAL). Specifically, we design a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)-based feature selection method to identify the most useful features. Then, a residual network (ResNet) and a long short term memory neural network with an attention mechanism (ALSTM) are employed, to extract temporal patterns of network traffic events. After that, these patterns are orchestrated to identify the anomalies in IoE networks. The high effectiveness of the proposed IDS is validated on a real IoE dataset."

Such Centers are quite vulnerable in terms of information security. To ensure the security of the Center, the balance of performance of its individual elements must be maintained. The authors of the publication offer a formalized description of the process of information processing in the Data Center and a method of assessing the performance of its elements based on the time profile. The input data for the calculations are the bandwidth of individual performers and the response time of the system to requests. The efficiency parameters are the minimum query calculation time, the average task execution time, and the average queue time. Such parameters are interdependent and the authors proved the relationship between the main indicators by modeling. In particular, it was proved that increasing the number of actions per task or reducing the power clearly leads to a decrease in bandwidth."

In this paper, we propose a novel malware family clustering approach based on dynamic and static features with their weights. In this approach, we employ a new similarity measurement method based on EMD to improve the accuracy of feature similarities.

The application of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard can help a country or organization in building and maintaining an information security management system (ISMS). In addition to protecting data and information, ISO/ IEC27001 can also manage information security risks to increase the trust of relevant stakeholders. Nowadays, there is no structured information regarding the use of standards in information security. In Indonesia, the ISO/IEC 27001 family is widely used for implementing information security in the cyber field. Therefore, there is a need for a comparative study of the use of ISO/IEC 27001 in Indonesia and other countries. There is a need for details regarding the implementation of the ISO/IEC 27001 family in various countries for academics or implementers. This study aims to provide information to the government, information security experts, academics, and implementers regarding which countries are implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 family in the implementation of their information security policy requirements also compared to the GCI rank. Our comparative analysis has shown that Sweden uses ISO/IEC 27001 family the most, the second is the United Kingdom and the third is Malaysia. So, the ISO/IEC 27001 family of standards use is affecting the GCI rank which lies in the legal measures."
9744592,Qrator: An Interest-Aware Approach to ABR Streaming Based on User Engagement,"Conventional approaches to adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming fail to further improve the quality of experience (QoE) as they are indifferent to video semantics and user behaviors by focusing solely on the network conditions. These ABR schemes cannot enhance the perceptual video quality as they neglect the users’ varying degree of interest (DoI) over video sections and may experience QoE degradation due to frequent rebuffers caused by user behaviors such as selectively watching the interesting sections. To this end, this article proposes Qrator, which is the very first attempt to utilize timestamps and likes as user engagement data to infer users’ genuine interests and further elevate the user-perceived QoE. Based on timestamps and likes in video comments, Qrator improves the overall QoE by considering DoI variations and user behaviors in performing interest-aware rate adaptation and prefetching. Qrator can be widely applied to conventional ABR approaches without significantly modifying their implementations. Evaluation results show that Qrator can heighten the bitrates of user interest sections without degrading the average bitrate. Furthermore, applying Qrator under user behavior patterns can reduce the rebuffering ratio and the number of rebuffers by 32% and 31%, respectively, while maintaining other QoE metrics to a similar extent."
9121656,A multi-flow information flow tracking approach for proving quantitative hardware security properties,"Information Flow Tracking (IFT) is an established formal method for proving security properties related to confidentiality, integrity, and isolation. It has seen promise in identifying security vulnerabilities resulting from design flaws, timing channels, and hardware Trojans for secure hardware design. However, existing IFT methods tend to take a qualitative approach and only enforce binary security properties, requiring strict non-interference for the properties to hold while real systems usually allow a small amount of information flows to enable desirable interactions. Consequently, existing methods are inadequate for reasoning about quantitative security properties or measuring the security of a design in order to assess the severity of a security vulnerability. In this work, we propose two multi-flow solutions - multiple verifications for replicating existing IFT model and multi-flow IFT method. The proposed multi-flow IFT method provides more insight into simultaneous information flow behaviors and allows for proof of quantitative information flow security properties, such as diffusion, randomization, and boundaries on the amount of simultaneous information flows. Experimental results show that our method can be used to prove a new type of information flow security property with verification performance benefits."

Keystroke dynamics can be used to identify people, and it can replace the second factor in two-factor authentication. This paper presents a keystroke dynamics biometric system for user authentication in mobile devices. We propose to use data from sensors of motion and position as features for the biometric system to improve the quality of user recognition. The proposed novel model combines different anomaly detection methods (distance-based and density-based) in an ensemble. We achieved the average EER of 8.0%. Our model has a retraining module that updates the keystroke dynamics template of a user each time after a successful authentication in the system. All the process of training and retraining a model and making a decision is made directly on a mobile device using our mobile application, as well as keystroke data is stored on a device."
9510019,Comparison of various interpolation techniques to infer localization of audio files using ENF signals,"Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) is a frequency of the electrical power signal of the power grid that plays a key role in the level of security. There is a difference in the values on the supply and demand on power usage. Due to its distinctive value, the ENF data hold great importance in the field of security. Examining the ENF signal makes it possible to trace the location where the ENF signal was generated. By making the most use of certain interpolation techniques, we can estimate the ENF value of a specific location and evaluate the estimated performance. Interpolating the ENF signals on the target location can increase the accuracy of the estimate for the unacquainted ENF signals. In this paper, we interpolated the ENF values of the power grid of the United States by using three different methods: IDW, Ordinary Kriging, and Universal Kriging. Then we evaluated the RMSE calculated by varying the hyper-parameters and models of interpolation methods. As a result, it was found that applying the Ordinary Kriging in the Western grid had the lowest RMSE. For the Eastern power grid, it was the IDW with λ=-1 which showed the lowest RMSE. We concluded that each power grid had different characteristics. Therefore different interpolation techniques should be applied to each case for precise approximation."
9591080,PROLEPSIS: Binary Analysis and Instrumentation of IoT Software for Control-Flow Integrity,"Nowadays, the growing pervasiveness of digital components and their interconnection in the so-called Internet of Things, raises serious questions regarding security and integrity not only of the data exchanged, but also of the devices themselves and the software they run. Code-Reuse Attacks (CRA) are one of the most powerful binary attack paradigms, aiming to exploit memory vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows to force the application to execute an unintended sequence of instructions present in memory. To counter such a kind of attacks, ensuring the program's control-flow integrity (CFI) appears to be the most promising solution presented so far. A plethora of CFI implementations have been offered in the literature and by vendors, based on control-flow monitors located at the software level or even into hardware extensions. However, many proposed solutions opt for coarse-grained checks, or insert enforcement before all flow transfers. For software running on IoT platforms, where resources are usually limited, protections can increase the footprint in an unsustainable way. This paper presents PROLEPSIS, an automated binary code analysis tool for IoT applications written for ARM platforms. With an optimised search, the tool is able to identify only those executable point (control-flow instructions) that are really at risk of control-flow hijacking. Each recognised insecure point is instrumented according to a custom technique of choice, either based on a software or a hardware monitor, depending on the specific application needs."
9207857,Privacy-Preserving Multi-Keyword Searchable Encryption for Distributed Systems,"As cloud storage has been widely adopted in various applications, how to protect data privacy while allowing efficient data search and retrieval in a distributed environment remains a challenging research problem. Existing searchable encryption schemes are still inadequate on desired functionality and security/privacy perspectives. Specifically, supporting multi-keyword search under the multi-user setting, hiding search pattern and access pattern, and resisting keyword guessing attacks (KGA) are the most challenging tasks. In this article, we present a new searchable encryption scheme that addresses the above problems simultaneously, which makes it practical to be adopted in distributed systems. It not only enables multi-keyword search over encrypted data under a multi-writer/multi-reader setting but also guarantees the data and search pattern privacy. To prevent KGA, our scheme adopts a multi-server architecture, which accelerates search response, shares the workload, and lowers the key leakage risk by allowing only authorized servers to jointly test whether a search token matches a stored ciphertext. A novel subset decision mechanism is also designed as the core technique underlying our scheme and can be further used in applications other than keyword search. Finally, we prove the security and evaluate the computational and communication efficiency of our scheme to demonstrate its practicality."
9257557,An Immune-Based Real-Time Quantitative Detection for Threat Change of Cyberspace Digital Virtual Assets,"Traditional attribute-based identification and protection, and based on game theory, advanced encryption and secret sharing are difficult to guarantee the security of virtual assets, a more comprehensive and in-depth study in the security threat to the asset carriers and trading networks is urgently needed. This paper simulates the mechanism of the human immune system “synchronous dynamic evolution of antibody concentration with invasion virus”, a real-time quantitative detection for threat change of digital virtual assets in cyberspace based on immunity is proposed. Firstly, the concentration of antibodies in the immune system was calculated and analyzed theoretically. Then, the attack harmfulness of digital virtual assets is quantified. Finally, the risk value of digital virtual assets against each type of attack and the overall risk value of digital virtual assets are obtained. This method can detect the threat of virtual assets in time and accurately, and lay a foundation for the protection of digital virtual assets in cyberspace. At the same time, the experimental results also show that when the illegal operation of digital virtual assets occurs, it can reflect the current virtual assets threat changes in a timely and accurate manner."

9120246,Toward Swarm Coordination: Topology-Aware Inter-UAV Routing Optimization,"Swarm unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an approach to the coordination of multiple UAVs as a system, which has huge advantages on mission capabilities, such as cooperative search, border surveillance, and situation awareness. For better swarm coordination, a robust inter-UAV network, especially in ad hoc mode, is needed. Due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks owing to mobility and topology change, adapting routing quickly to topology changes is one of the key components of UAV networks. Based on investigating the relationship between the swarm formation control and the network topology, we propose a proactive topology-aware scheme to track the network topology change. Through simulations on Qualnet and real-world experiments with five quadrotors, the results confirmed that the proposed scheme reduces the average delay and improves routing performance significantly."
9730156,Robust Black-box Watermarking for Deep Neural Network using Inverse Document Frequency,"Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), presented exceptional achievement in implementing human-level capabilities for various predicaments, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), voice recognition, and image processing, etc. Training these models is expensive in terms of computational power and the existence of enough labelled data. Thus, ML-based models such as DNNs establish genuine business value and intellectual property (IP) for their owners. Therefore the trained models need to be protected from any adversary attacks such as illegal redistribution, reproducing, and derivation. Watermarking can be considered as an effective technique for securing a DNN model. However, so far, most of the watermarking algorithms focus on watermarking the DNN by adding noise to an image. To this end, we propose a framework for watermarking a DNN model designed for textual domain. The watermark generation scheme provides a secure watermarking method by combining Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of a particular word. The proposed embedding procedure takes place in the model's training stage, which makes the watermark verification stage straightforward by sending the watermarked document to the trained model. The experimental results show that watermarked models have the same accuracy as the original one, and the proposed framework accurately verifies the ownership of all surrogate models without impairing the performance. The proposed algorithm is robust against well-known attacks such as parameter pruning and brute force attack."
9504596,Secure and Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Co-Utility,"The decentralized nature of federated learning, that often leverages the power of edge devices, makes it vulnerable to attacks against privacy and security. The privacy risk for a peer is that the model update she computes on her private data may, when sent to the model manager, leak information on those private data. Even more obvious are security attacks, whereby one or several malicious peers return wrong model updates in order to disrupt the learning process and lead to a wrong model being learned. In this article, we build a federated learning framework that offers privacy to the participating peers as well as security against the Byzantine and poisoning attacks. Our framework consists of several protocols that provide strong privacy to the participating peers via unlinkable anonymity and that are rationally sustainable based on the co-utility property. In other words, no rational party is interested in deviating from the proposed protocols. We leverage the notion of co-utility to build a decentralized co-utile reputation management system that provides incentives for parties to adhere to the protocols. Unlike privacy protection via differential privacy, our approach preserves the values of model updates and, hence, the accuracy of plain federated learning; unlike privacy protection via update aggregation, our approach preserves the ability to detect bad model updates while substantially reducing the computational overhead compared to methods based on homomorphic encryption."
9139739,Co-Utile Peer-to-Peer Decentralized Computing,"Outsourcing computation allows wielding huge computational power. Even though cloud computing is the most usual type of outsourcing, resorting to idle edge devices for decentralized computation is an increasingly attractive alternative. We tackle the problem of making peer honesty and thus computation correctness self-enforcing in decentralized computing with untrusted peers. To do so, we leverage the co-utility property, which characterizes a situation in which honest co-operation is the best rational option to take even for purely selfish agents; in particular, if a protocol is co-utile, it is self-enforcing. Reputation is a powerful incentive that can make a P2P protocol co-utile. We present a co-utile P2P decentralized computing protocol that builds on a decentralized reputation calculation, which is itself co-utile and therefore self-enforcing. In this protocol, peers are given a computational task including code and data and they are incentivized to compute it correctly. Based also on co-utile reputation, we then present a protocol for federated learning, whereby peers compute on their local private data and have no incentive to randomly attack or poison the model. Our experiments show the viability of our co-utile approach to obtain correct results in both decentralized computation and federated learning."

9717379,Designing a Modular and Distributed Web Crawler Focused on Unstructured Cybersecurity Intelligence,"There are many use cases for cybersecurity related information available on the Internet. Tasks relating to natural language processing and machine learning require large amounts of structured and labeled data. However, the availability of recent data is limited due to the difficulty in its sanitization, retrieval, and labeling. Data on the Internet is generally diverse and unstructured, and storing this information in a manner that is easily usable for research and development purposes is not an intuitive task. We propose architectural considerations when developing a distributed system consisting of web crawlers, web scrapers, and various post-processing components, as well as possible implementations of these considerations. Our team developed such a system that is capable of applying structure and storing open source intelligence data from the Internet in an easily-searchable software platform called Splunk."

9536320,A Game Theoretic Perspective on Adversarial Machine Learning and Related Cybersecurity Applications,"stract:
In cybersecurity applications where machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to detect vulnerabilities, a somewhat unique challenge arises as exploits targeting machine learning models are constantly devised by the attackers. Traditional machine learning models are no longer robust and reliable when they are under attack. The action and reaction between machine learning systems and the adversary can be modeled as a game between two or more players. Under well‐defined attack models, game theory can provide robustness guarantee for machine learning models that are otherwise vulnerable to application‐time data corruption. We review two cases of game theory‐based machine learning techniques: in one case, players play a zero sum game by following a minimax strategy, while in the other case, players play a sequential game with one player as the leader and the rest as the followers. Experimental results on e‐mail spam and web spam datasets are presented. In the zero sum game, we demonstrate that an adversarial SVM model built upon the minimax strategy is much more resilient to adversarial attacks than standard SVM and one‐class SVM models. We also show that optimal learning strategies derived to counter overly pessimistic attack models can produce unsatisfactory results when the real attacks are much weaker. In the sequential game, we demonstrate that the mixed strategy, allowing a player to randomize over available strategies, is the best solution in general without knowing what types of adversaries machine learning applications are facing in the wild. We also discuss scenarios where players' behavior may derail rational decision making and models that consider such decision risks."
9343703,Optimization-Time Analysis for Cybersecurity,"A mathematical framework to reason about time resilience in cybersecurity is introduced. We first consider an attacker who can mount several multi-stage attacks on the organization: the defender's objective is to select an optimal portfolio of security controls, within a given budget, to withstand the highest number of attacks. The mathematical model is a Markov chain with an initial state called the safe state, intermediate states for all possible attacks (each attack state denoting a probabilistic attack graph), and a sink state denoting a successful attack. The overall defence problem is formulated as a bi-level multi-objective optimization, i.e. the defender selects an optimal portfolio of security controls to mitigate an optimal attacker. To determine the probability of success of an attack two cases will be considered: (a)the expected probability of success; (b)the highest probability of success. We refer to these two cases as expected-time analysis and worst-case time analysis. To solve precisely these bi-level optimizations strong duality and Mixed Integer Linear Programming are used. We then extend the framework to investigate resilience in terms of the total duration of the attacks; variations of the previous optimizations are presented to this purpose. Numerical evaluations are provided to compare the results obtained from the expected-time analysis and the worst-case time analysis."
9743183,Conscious Machines for Autonomous Agents and Cybersecurity,"Although consciousness has been difficult to define, most researchers in artificial intelligence would agree that AI systems to date have not exhibited anything resembling consciousness. But is a conscious machine possible in the near future? I suggest that a new definition of consciousness may provide a basis for developing a conscious machine. The key is pattern recognition of correlated events in time, leading to the identification of a unified self-agent. Such a conscious system can create a simplified virtual environment, revise it to reflect updated sensor inputs, and partition the environment into self, other agents, and relevant objects. It can track recent time sequences of events, predict future events based on models and patterns in memory, and attribute causality to events and agents. It can make rapid decisions based on incomplete data, and can dynamically learn new responses based on appropriate measures of success and failure. The central aspect of consciousness is the generation of a dynamic narrative, a real-time model of a self-agent pursuing goals in a virtual reality. A conscious machine of this type may be implemented using an appropriate neural network linked to episodic memories. Near-term applications may include autonomous vehicles and online agents for cybersecurity."

9302951,False Data Injection Cyber Range of Modernized Substation System,"The extensive deployment of information and communication technologies in modern power grid makes the grid more vulnerable to cyber attacks, resulting in threats to the economy, social stability and sometimes human lives. While it is necessary to deploy cybersecurity measures to counter such threats, evaluation of the effectiveness and negative impact of the cybersecurity solutions through extensive experiments is challenging. For instance, it is often very restricted or even impossible to conduct experiments directly on the operating physical systems as the interruption of those critical systems will incur significant financial losses. In this paper, we discuss components and configurations that are necessary to implement a cyber range, a virtual environment for cybersecurity evaluation and experimentation, for emerging false data injection attacks against the smart grid. We also discuss the proof-of-concept implementation using open-source software and discuss case studies of attacks against modernized substation systems."

8702015,Conceptualizing the cyber incident & event statistics reporting standards,"The development of technology led the cyberspace to be directly connected to the daily life. For a nation, it is essential to collect and analyze the statistics produced from cyber-attack incidents to formulate a policy. Specifically, in the Republic of Korea, the second most cyber-attacked country in the world, the synchronization between the cybersecurity technology and policy is essential. However, in current status, the statistics collected by the government ministries in Korea is varied. For instance, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Science & Technology has a different standard in defining the event and incident and its numbers. Thus, the study aims to propose a standardized concept of cyber incident and event statistics which can provide singularized criteria which can be adopted across the ministerial disciplines. In order to provide aforementioned concept, the authors have posed following research questions. First, how to conceptualize the different types of cyber-attacks into a single standard of reporting cyber incidents? Second, what is the proper definition for cyber incident in both national and international levels of policy dialogue? Third, will the established concept can be proposed as an international standard? The authors first breakdown the scattered conceptual knowledge of cybersecurity by the methodology proposed by Gerring (1999) to provide a better concept which can deliver the better knowledge in cybersecurity policy. After, the authors propose the qualitative method in order to develop the single standard in collecting cyber incident statistics. Finally, the authors leave the possible extensions for future related research area based on the proposed method."
9492819,Preventive and Reactive Cyber Defense Dynamics With Ergodic Time-Dependent Parameters is Globally Attractive,"Cybersecurity dynamics is a mathematical approach to modeling and analyzing cyber attacker-defender interactions in networks. In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art in characterizing one kind of cybersecurity dynamics, known as preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics , which is a family of highly nonlinear dynamical system models. We prove that this family of dynamics in its general form with time-dependent parameters is globally attractive when the time-dependent parameters are ergodic , and is (almost) periodic when the time-dependent parameters have the stronger properties of being (almost) periodic . Our results supersede the state-of-the-art ones, including the recent result that the same family of dynamics in the special case of time-independent parameters is globally convergent . This paper represents a significant advance in the network science approach to theoretical cybersecurity modeling because it makes the so-far weakest assumptions when compared with the literature results."

9529935,Cyber Protection of Grid-Connected Devices Through Embedded Online Security,"Cybersecurity research regarding the electric power grid has primarily been focused on protecting the communication layer of grid-connected devices against cyber-attack threats. Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device’s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system."
9142678,Development of IoT Security Exercise Contents for Cyber Security Exercise System,"In this paper, we discuss the development of the IoT security exercise content and the implementation of it to the CyExec. While the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more popular, vulnerability countermeasures are insufficient, and many incidents have occurred. It is because there is insufficient protection against vulnerabilities specific to IoT equipment. Also, the developers and users have low awareness of IoT devices against vulnerabilities from the past. Therefore, the importance of security education on IoT devices is increasing. However, the enormous burden of introduction and operation costs limited the use of commercial cybersecurity exercise systems. CyExec (Cyber Security Exercise System), consisting of a virtual environment using VirtualBox and Docker, is a low-cost and flexible cybersecurity exercise system, which we have proposed for the dissemination of security education. And the content of the exercises for CyExec is composed of the Basic exercises and Applied exercises."
9040727,AAG: A Model for Attack Behavior Judgment in CTF-style Cyber Security Training,"Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions become popular to engage people with the world of cybersecurity. In CTF-style cybersecurity training, judging trainees' attack behavior in terms of attack time, methods, and consequences is the key to know trainee ability and thus to provide more targeted training. Previous work focuses on consequences and lacks judgment on attack methods, which cannot provide enough information for trainers to assess trainee ability. To solve this problem, we propose a model called Attack Action Graph (AAG) to help judge trainees' behavior. By creating AAG, we characterize predictable and unpredictable attack methods and establish an association between attack methods and consequences. Then we update AAG based on feature detection technology to judge attack behavior. In the experiment based on a typical enterprise network, AAG helps us to achieve real-time judgment of all predicted attack behavior. We find that only 5% of the trainees have unpredicted attack behavior. After extracting the characteristics of unpredicted attack behavior and doing offline judgment, we find new attack methods and cheating behavior."

9464018,Towards Robust Security Risk Metrics for Networked Systems: Work in Progress,"Security risk quantification is a necessary step in protecting critical resources in today's networked systems. Conventional security risk measures are based on the point estimates of the likelihoods of potential multi-step attacks that combine multiple vulnerabilities. Drawbacks of these measures are due to disregard for the tail risk, inherent inaccuracy of estimates of low probabilities, and reliance on the specific attacker(s) model. The recently proposed measure of cybersecurity risk - Cyber security Value at Risk (CyVaR), which is based on the VaR measure of financial risk, accounts for the tail risk. However, CyVaR still suffers from reliance on the specific attack model, and moreover has its own problems, e.g., it is not a coherent risk measure, which is currently considered to be a necessary trait of a risk measure. Following the recent trend of replacing VaR with the robust and coherent Entropic VaR (EVaR) as a financial risk measure, we suggest replacing CyVaR with CyEVaR. Using an example of a networked system and a highly motivated and capable attacker, we demonstrate that conventional risk measures may significantly underestimate the actual cybersecurity risk. Finally, we outline directions of future research."

9699337,"Cyber-Risk Management Planning Using NIST CSF v1.1, NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, and CIS Controls v8","With the use of information systems as a means for supporting the success of missions and objectives of organizations increased, the protection towards assets against cyber risks needs to be considered and paid more attention. Cyber-risk management planning can be carried out as a means or approach to protect assets from the risks of cyber-attacks. As a supporting unit in XYZ, the IT Unit has the responsibility to manage the information systems, information technology, and their infrastructure and services within the XYZ system. However, the IT Unit has never conducted a cybersecurity evaluation so it does not yet have a plan for cybersecurity risk management. In this study, we tailored a cyber-risk plan for the IT Unit of XYZ using NIST CSF as the main framework and CIS Controls v8 and NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 for defining controls and action recommendations. As the results, we found 42 risk scenarios in the IT Unit in which 12 are accepted and 30 are mitigated. There are 14 actions recommendation for the IT Unit to reach tier 3 based on 18 controls of CIS and 20 controls of NIST SP 800-53 rev 5 that can be applied to control the current cyber-risk."

9125052,Dependability Assessment for SCADA System Considering Usage of Cloud Resources,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is one the most significant cyber-oriented components of management circuit for any complex hierarchical infrastructure. The effectiveness and performance of the SCADA system depends on a number of relevant factors including a possibility to utilize additional cloud resources. Of particular note, the cloud services can apply in order to create concurrent redundant system for implementation of disaster recovery feature of SCADA information resources during different deliberate malicious impacts and intrusions. However, in spite of the fact that usage of the cloud services allow to enhance functionality of SCADA system, there are dependability and cybersecurity aspects for their joint utilization hat keep to remain a serious challenge for service personnel and users. In this paper, authors propose to employ analytical and stochastic modelling in order to get a numerical dependability assessment for SCADA system with realization of the cloud resourcing support considering influence of diverse negative factors. Furthermore, developers can utilize these modelling results in order to perform justification of overall functional requirements of the SCADA system."

9319010,What Information is Required for Explainable AI? : A Provenance-based Research Agenda and Future Challenges,"Deriving explanations of an Artificial Intelligence-based system's decision making is becoming increasingly essential to address requirements that meet quality standards and operate in a transparent, comprehensive, understandable, and explainable manner. Furthermore, more security issues as well as concerns from human perspectives emerge in describing the explainability properties of AI. A full system view is required to enable humans to properly estimate risks when dealing with such systems. This paper introduces open issues in this research area to present the overall picture of explainability and the required information needed for the explanation to make a decision-oriented AI system transparent to humans. It illustrates the potential contribution of proper provenance data to AI-based systems by describing a provenance graph-based design. This paper proposes a six-Ws framework to demonstrate how a security-aware provenance graph-based design can build the basis for providing end-users with sufficient meta-information on AI-based decision systems. An example scenario is then presented that highlights the required information for better explainability both from human and security-aware aspects. Finally, associated challenges are discussed to provoke further research and commentary."

9581003,Control-Flow Integrity for Real-Time Operating Systems: Open Issues and Challenges,"The pervasive presence of smart objects in almost every corner of our everyday life urges the security of such embedded systems to be the point of attention. Memory vulnerabilities in the embedded program code, such as buffer overflow, are the entry point for powerful attack paradigms such as Code-Reuse Attacks (CRAs), in which attackers corrupt systems’ execution flow and maliciously alter their behavior. Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) has been proven to be the most promising approach against such kinds of attacks, and in the literature, a wide range of flow monitors are proposed, both hardware-based and software-based. While the formers are hardly applicable as they impose design alteration of underlying hardware modules, on the contrary, software solutions are more flexible and also portable to the existing devices. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and their key role in application development for embedded systems is the main concern regarding the application of the CFI solutions.This paper discusses the still open challenges and issues regarding the implementation of control-flow integrity policies on operating systems for embedded systems, analyzing the solutions proposed so far in the literature, highlighting possible limits in terms of performance, applicability, and protection coverage, and proposing possible improvement directions."
9087851,Defining Social Engineering in Cybersecurity,"Social engineering has posed a serious security threat to infrastructure, user, data and operations of cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are many conceptual deficiencies (such as inconsistent conceptual intensions, a vague conceptual boundary, confusing instances, overgeneralization and abuse) of the term making serious negative impacts on the understanding, analysis and defense of social engineering attacks. In this paper, an in-depth literature survey is conducted, the original meaning of social engineering in cybersecurity is traced, the conceptual evolution and technical development are analysed systematically, and the conceptual problems are discussed. Based on above work, this paper attempts to address these conceptual deficiencies by proposing a more compatible and precise definition of social engineering in cybersecurity (SEiCS). This definition eliminates the conceptual inconsistencies, covers the mainstream conceptual connotations, clarifies the conceptual boundary, mitigates the overgeneralization and abuse, etc. Five analysis tables (i.e., the comparative analysis of the SEiCS definition vs. mainstream conceptual intensions in the conceptual evolution, the comparative analysis of the SEiCS definition vs. typical definitions in the literature, the analysis of confusing “social engineering cases”, the analysis of popular social engineering attack scenarios, and the analysis of social-engineering-based attacks) are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed definition."
9213903,"Toward Cybersecurity of Unmanned Aircraft System operations under ""Specific"" category","Nowadays, the increasing number of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations raises public concerns on cybersecurity issues. Therefore, it requires a methodology to address these issues during the UAS development. The Specific Operation Risk Assessment (SORA) is a risk assessment methodology developed by Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Aircraft System (JARUS). This methodology is endorsed by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as an acceptable means to fulfill the requirements of EU regulation related to UAS operations under the Specific category. The original SORA methodology focus on Safety risk scenarios only, which relate to unintentional threats and the harms to people's life.

In this paper we evaluate an intervention method of peer mentoring to help increase interest in data analytics in cybersecurity. We present a text mining approach to analyze student assignments while they undergo a peer mentoring exercise. In our prior work, we have shown that the peer mentoring approach is effective at improving the students' interest in cybersecurity careers and contributes to an overall better knowledge gain throughout the semester. This was also reflected by an improvement in grades with two years of anonymous survey results. Across the years we also observed that peer mentoring is particularly effective in diverse groups. In this paper, we perform text mining of the written assignments for analyzing the group behavior of the control and experiment sections of a class while also documenting the effectiveness of intervention methods such as peer mentoring. We employ a few text mining techniques, namely Text Frequency Analysis, Lexical Diversity, Readability Analysis, Word Cloud Visualization, Hyperlink usage and Objectivity Analysis on the text assignments submitted by the students and show that students who receive peer mentoring are able to express more complex ideas with fewer words and thereby receive higher grades by the end of the semester. Based on these results, we also discuss how our methodology would be applicable in increasing reachability and diversity in other specialized computing courses such as Big Data and distributed systems."

9449391,Cybersecurity based on IEC 62351 and IEC 62443 for IEC 61850 systems,"The word “cyber,” originating from the Greek word meaning “skilled steering or guidance,” has taken on the modern meaning of using digital communications within and among intelligent devices to perform information gathering and commanded control. Information technology (IT) systems include networked communications among computers, business systems, and the internet. Operational technology (OT) systems include networked communications among industrial control system (ICS) devices performing automatic safety, operational, and monitoring processes. In this paper, established ICS methods and standards are used to design defense-in-depth cybersecurity methods for digital communications within an energy control system (ECS) communications network. The ECS communications architecture is a mission-critical ICS and is divided into multiple levels with unique requirements and features from the process up through the station and finally to the control center. Using these levels, it is possible to identify interacting cyber defense technologies, the levels at which they should be deployed, and which devices they belong to (IEC 62443 Part 3) instead of the arbitrary defense-in-breadth strategy of requesting that every device include every cyber defense technology (IEC 62443 Part 4)."

8815692,A Parallel Control Framework of Analog Proportional Integral and Digital Model Predictive Controllers for Enhancing Power Converters Cybersecurity,"Digital control endows power electronic converters with networking capability and makes them potential for the Internet of Energy (IoE). However, the IoE provides many interfaces for hackers and increases the risk of cybersecurity. To defend networked converters against cyberattacks, this article proposes a control framework where the digital model predictive controller (MPC) and the analog proportional integral controller (PIC) are physically connected in parallel. Due to such a parallel structure, once the converter is cyberattacked, the digital MPC can be physically isolated from the control loop, while the converter can still persist working under the dominating of only the analog PIC. In addition, the digital MPC and the analog PIC can compatibly operate under normal conditions to achieve excellent dynamic performances and zero steady-state error. The validity of the parallel control is verified on a buck converter as an example, and the control performances are also verified by experiments."

9699158,Investigating operative cybersecurity awareness in air traffic control,"Although the feasibility of cyberattacks manipulating air traffic control surveillance data have been demonstrated, the probability that such attacks can occur is seen as very low in the aviation industry. As a consequence, training to prepare for such events is typically not conducted. This paper presents a study using surveillance pictures and low-fidelity simulation to investigate the operative cybersecurity awareness of air traffic control officers (ATCOs). Five licensed ATCOs participated in a 1-1.5-hour remote data collection session. The results show that the participants did not detect the developing cyberattack until it became very obvious. The participant's perception of the situation was changed after they realized it was a cyber-event. Although they focused on traffic resolution and the safety of the aircrafts, they now prepared for situations where the aircraft had to land on their own due to possible further degradation of air traffic management systems. The study also showed the feasibility of using a low-fidelity simulation of ATM scenarios with remote participation. Even though interactivity and realism were limited, this kind of abstracted simulation allowed for learning from and reflecting around the scenarios. The results show the needs for awareness of possible cyber events in the operative environment."

Second, it considers the particular use of these techniques by state actors (i.e., nation states engaged in declared or undeclared cyberwarfare) who are likely to encounter a greater level of such vulnerability exploits than individuals or private businesses during the normal operations. Drawing on the analysis in the two foregoing areas, the paper concludes by identifying key areas of needed future work to support runtime verification's application in this area."
8965116,Preliminary Considerations for a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System Cybersecurity Reference Architecture,"Cyber security and privacy are major challenges for interconnected automatic driving cars which rely on confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, accountability as well as privacy of a cooperative intelligent transport system (C-ITS). The cars require detailed data about the environment on different levels to generate a comprehensive overview of the current traffic situation in real time to ensure their safe and secure movement. The availability, integrity, authenticity and accountability of data and its processing are a prerequisite for automated and interconnected driving. Additionally, confidentiality and privacy are main requirements for using C-ITS services. Cyber security is not only necessary for an efficient traffic management. Co-operative functions and coordinative autonomy is mandatory, since successful intentional attacks on a C-ITS in fact threaten human lives. There is a fundamental need for a comprehensive harmonization of safety and security aspects from the infrastructure provider's perspective to ensure awareness and trust - and not solely from an original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) view. Especially cyber security is essential to make these cooperative traffic structures and autonomous interconnected driving technologies confidently available to society. In this paper, the approach for component identification, scoping, use case development, and the applied risk management method as preliminary work for the development of a comprehensive C-ITS cybersecurity reference framework is discussed. These steps are part of a currently ongoing research project."

The very complexes characteristics of such system expose their applications and their exchanged data to multiples risks and security breaches that make them targets for cyber attacks. The aim of our work in this paper is to provide an cybersecurity strategy whose objective is to prevent and anticipate threats related to the IoE. An economic approach is used in order to help to take decisions according to the reduction of the risks generated by the non definition of the appropriate levels of security. The considered problem have been resolved by exploiting a combinatorial optimization approach with a practical case of knapsack. We opted for a bi-objective modeling under uncertainty with a constraint of cardinality and a given budget to be respected. To guarantee a robustness of our strategy, we have also considered the criterion of uncertainty by taking into account all the possible threats that can be generated by a cyber attacks over IoE. Our strategy have been implemented and simulated under MATLAB environement and its performance results have been compared to those obtained by NSGA-II metaheuristic. Our proposed cyber security strategy recorded a clear improvment of efficiency according to the optimization of the security level and cost parametrs."

9672578,Cybersecurity in Aviation: the STPA-Sec Method Applied to the TCAS Security,"This work presents the cybersecurity theme in the aviation ecosystem and a case study for the application of the STPA-Sec method, in the TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System). The aviation community is benefiting from new levels of digitization and connectivity, but the effectiveness gained by increased digitization has led to increased levels of system vulnerabilities. Therefore, the work is focused on the application of the STPA method, aiming to increase security from the point of view of planned attacks, that is, intentional attacks, sabotage, malicious aircraft interference and how these attacks relate to events unplanned or unintended ralated to the “ghost aircraft” vulnerability of the TCAS. The STPA applied to neutralize the TCAS ghost aircraft attacks pointed out that the air collision avoidance system is a critical system as it involves loss of life or human injury, loss of critical data, damage to the aircraft, inability to complete primary missions, loss of customer satisfaction and loss of airline reputation. In this sense, the work highlights the importance of the role of STPA-Sec method in improving aircraft security and motivates redesign and updates to TCAS."

9511780,Satellite-derived Time for Enhanced Telecom Networks Synchronization: the ROOT Project,"Satellite-derived timing information plays a determinant role in the provisioning of an absolute time reference to telecommunications networks, as well as in a growing set of other critical infrastructures. In light of the stringent requirements in terms of time, frequency, and phase synchronization foreseen in upcoming access network architectures (i.e., 5G), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers are expected to ensure enhanced accuracy and reliability not only in positioning but also in timing. High-end GNSS timing receivers combined with terrestrial cesium clocks and specific transport protocols can indeed satisfy such synchronization requirements by granting sub-nanosecond accuracy. As a drawback, the network infrastructure can be exposed to accidental interferences and intentional cyber-attacks. Within this framework, the ROOT project investigates the effectiveness and robustness of innovative countermeasures to GNSS and cybersecurity threats within a reference network architecture."
9579750,EfficientNet-based Convolutional Neural Networks for Malware Classification,"Malicious software is posing a great challenge to Cybersecurity by causing huge damage to enterprises and users.

9644625,A Name-Based Secure Communications Architecture for Vehicular Networks,"Forthcoming automotive cybersecurity standards such as ISO 21434 and regulations such as WP.29 make it imperative that automakers establish cybersecurity-by-design practices. Vehicle communication cybersecurity (both in- and out-of-vehicle) is crucial in achieving this goal. With the adoption of automotive Ethernet, automakers are turning to the Internet protocol suite (IP) to achieve the desired cybersecurity properties. However, security was always an add-on to Internet protocols, resulting in well-known security weaknesses such as spoofing, denial of service attacks, lack of authentication and more. Such weaknesses may unwittingly be brought to the automotive space.In this position paper we take the position that the automotive industry should investigate other networking architectures besides IP as they move away from existing architectures such as CAN. Specifically, we propose Named Data Networking (NDN), an architecture that incorporates unified security-by-design from the network to the application layers. While NDN has not yet been used for in-vehicle communication, our position is that its superiority to IP, especially in security, makes it a strong candidate. Unlike IP, which secures the communication channel between two entities, NDN secures the content through digital signatures that cryptographically bind a name to the content, ensuring both authentication and integrity of the data. NDN is analogous to a pub-sub model and can be implemented directly over L2 or L3 layers."

In this paper, we investigate how to provide valuable post-game feedback to players of serious cybersecurity games through interactive visualizations. In collaboration with domain experts, we formulated user requirements that cover three cognitive perspectives: gameplay overview, person-centric view, and comparative feedback. Based on these requirements, we designed two interactive visualizations that provide complementary views on game results. They combine a known clustering and time-based visual approaches to show game results in a way that is easy to decode for players. The purposefulness of our visual feedback was evaluated in a usability field study with attendees of the Summer School in Cyber Security. The evaluation confirmed the adequacy of the two visualizations for instant post-game feedback. Despite our initial expectations, there was no strong preference for neither of the visualizations in solving different tasks."
9125029,Governance of Collaborative Networked Organisations: Stakeholder Requirements,"The digital transformation of industry provides opportunities for increased collaboration. Utilising the increasing power of communications and access to information, various collaborative networked organisations are established to respond quickly to emerging market demands while sharing resources and risk. The governance of such organisations remains a significant challenge. Therefore, in the process of designing a governance model for a cybersecurity network, a research team in the Horizon 2020 ECHO project pursued several venues to identify and prioritise governance needs and objectives. This paper presents the approach to soliciting the views of two groups of stakeholders – funding organisations and potential major customers of cybersecurity products and services – by conducting semi-structured interviews. The research method included quantitative and qualitative techniques for processing the inter-views, allowing to prioritise governance requirements from an initial list and to identify additional governance issues. As a result, the geographic representation in the networked organisation, the involvement of external stakeholders, the decision-making arrangements, and the need to provide for confidentiality emerged as governance issues of highest concern, followed by supply chain security, representation on the senior governance bodies, auditing, management of disputes and intellectual property rights, setting up an ethics code and policies for gender representation, transparency, accountability, and integrity."
9091574,A Novel Attack Detection Scheme for the Industrial Internet of Things Using a Lightweight Random Neural Network,"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) brings together many sensors, machines, industrial applications, databases, services, and people at work. The IIoT is improving our lives in several ways including smarter cities, agriculture, and e-healthcare, etc. Although the IIoT shares several characteristics with the consumer IoT, different cybersecurity mechanisms are adopted for both networks. Unlike consumer IoT solutions that are used by an individual user for a single purpose, IIoT solutions tend to be integrated into larger operational systems. As a result, IIoT security solutions require additional planning and awareness to ensure the security and privacy of the system. In this paper, different cybersecurity attacks such as denial of service (DoS), malicious operation, malicious control, data type probing, spying, scan, and wrong setup are predicted by applying machine learning techniques. To predict the aforementioned attacks, a novel lightweight random neural network (RaNN)-based prediction model has been proposed in this article. To investigate the performance of the RaNN-based prediction model, several evaluation parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated and compared with the traditional artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT). The evaluation results show that the proposed RaNN model achieves an accuracy of 99.20% for a learning rate of 0.01, with a prediction time of 34.51 milliseconds. Other performance parameters such as the precision, recall, and F1 score were 99.11%, 99.13%, and 99.20%, respectively. The proposed scheme improves the attack detection accuracy by an average of 5.65% compared to that of state-of-the-art machine learning schemes for IoT security."
8873588,A Novel Approach for Mitigation of Replay and Masquerade Attacks in Smartgrids Using IEC 61850 Standard,"There is growing awareness towards cybersecurity threats in power systems. Deployment of more intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) and the communication lines increase the probability of such attacks. IEC 61850 standard facilitates communication between different IEDs and eases interoperable operation with set data and message structures. An unwanted consequence of this standardized communication over ethernet is increased viability to cyber threats. Replay and masquerade attacks are, especially, of concern due to their imminent impact on the operation. While detecting replay attacks is easier, since the original messages are used for the attack, masquerade attack messages may be difficult to distinguish from original ones. Furthermore, inadequate mitigation approaches may be tricked by the hackers and the system starts the attacker as the authentic sender and discards original messages from authentic sources. It is vital to develop an approach that incorporates message authentication. In this fashion, when the hackers modify the message contents to by-pass security systems, the tampering can be detected, and the messages will be discarded. This paper analyses replay and masquerade attacks on IEC 61850 GOOSE messages and develops a solution to mitigates both of those. To detect modified messages, two distinct authentication mechanisms are utilized: RSA since it is the algorithm stipulated in IEC 62351-6 and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) due to its widespread use in smartgrid cybersecurity solutions. A full solution to mitigate GOOSE replay and masquerade attacks is developed based on the proposed framework in IEC 62351 standard. Full implementation is tested in the lab and results are included to show the viability of the solution."
9431125,Designing Comprehensive Cyber Threat Analysis Platform: Can We Orchestrate Analysis Engines?,"To cope with growing cyber threats on the Internet, various techniques have been proposed and implemented. Each of these techniques automates specific tasks of cybersecurity operations, and operators in the field locate and choose multiple tools and conduct security operations by subsequently using the tools and combining their outputs. Recent studies have been introducing many automation techniques for specific security tasks, but their combined use has not been thoroughly studied until now. To advance security automation further, a series of cybersecurity operation tasks needs to be automated by orchestrating different techniques. In this paper, we propose the cyber threat hybrid analysis platform, which orchestrates multiple automation techniques to expand their applicable scope. We also demonstrate the platform's usability and feasibility by describing a case study with a real malware sample."
9583720,Incremental Common Criteria Certification Processes using DevSecOps Practices,"The growing digitalisation of our economies and societies is driving the need for increased connectivity of critical applications and infrastructures to the point where failures can lead to important disruptions and consequences to our lives. One growing source of failures for critical applications and infrastructures originates from cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that can be exploited in attacks. One approach to mitigating these risks is verifying that critical applications and infrastructures are sufficiently protected by certification of products and services. However, reaching sufficient assurance levels for product certification may require detailed evaluation of product properties. An important challenge for product certification is dealing with product evolution: now that critical applications and infrastructures are connected they are being updated on a more frequent basis. To ensure continuity of certification, updates must be analysed to verify the impact on certified cybersecurity properties. Impacted properties need to be re-certified. This paper proposes a lightweight and flexible incremental certification process that can be integrated with DevSecOps practices to automate as much as possible evidence gathering and certification activities. The approach is illustrated on the Common Criteria product certification scheme and a firewall update on an automotive case study. Only the impact analysis phase of the incremental certification process is illustrated."
8762232,Adaptive Alert Management for Balancing Optimal Performance among Distributed CSOCs using Reinforcement Learning,"Large organizations typically have Cybersecurity Operations Centers (CSOCs) distributed at multiple locations that are independently managed, and they have their own cybersecurity analyst workforce. Under normal operating conditions, the CSOC locations are ideally staffed such that the alerts generated from the sensors in a work-shift are thoroughly investigated by the scheduled analysts in a timely manner. Unfortunately, when adverse events such as increase in alert arrival rates or alert investigation rates occur, alerts have to wait for a longer duration for analyst investigation, which poses a direct risk to organizations. Hence, our research objective is to mitigate the impact of the adverse events by dynamically and autonomously re-allocating alerts to other location(s) such that the performances of all the CSOC locations remain balanced. This is achieved through the development of a novel centralized adaptive decision support system whose task is to re-allocate alerts from the affected locations to other locations. This re-allocation decision is non-trivial because the following must be determined: (1) timing of a re-allocation decision, (2) number of alerts to be reallocated, and (3) selection of the locations to which the alerts must be distributed. The centralized decision-maker (henceforth referred to as agent) continuously monitors and controls the level of operational effectiveness-LOE (a quantified performance metric) of all the locations. The agent's decision-making framework is based on the principles of stochastic dynamic programming and is solved using reinforcement learning (RL). In the experiments, the RL approach is compared with both rule-based and load balancing strategies. By simulating real-world scenarios, learning the best decisions for the agent, and applying the decisions on sample realizations of the CSOC's daily operation, the results show that the RL agent outperforms both approaches by generating (near-) optimal decisions that mainta...

DL techniques have been used for foremost challenges in cybersecurity problems like intrusion detection, classification and detection of malware, spam detection and phishing detection. However, DL also can have misprediction due to internal/external malicious properties, it may produce complications in our real life. To avoid these drawbacks, this paper describes a new algorithm for the detection of malicious cyber-attack using DL and to minimize misprediction of DL techniques.

9030465,Dynamic Model of Cyber Defense Diagnostics of Information Systems With The Use of Fuzzy Technologies,"When building the architecture of cyber defense systems, one of the important tasks is to create a methodology for current diagnostics of cybersecurity status of information systems and objects of information activity. The complexity of this procedure is that having a strong security level of the object at the software level does not mean that such power is available at the hardware level or at the cryptographic level. There are always weaknesses in all levels of information security that criminals are constantly looking for. Therefore, the task of promptly calculating the likelihood of possible negative consequences from the successful implementation of cyberattacks is an urgent task today. This paper proposes an approach of obtaining an instantaneous calculation of the probabilities of negative consequences from the successful implementation of cyberattacks on objects of information activity on the basis of delayed differential equation theory and the mechanism of constructing a logical Fuzzy function. This makes it possible to diagnose the security status of the information system."
8679122,Understanding the Security Threats of Esoteric Subdomain Takeover and Prevention Scheme,"With the impetuous improvement of cyber intelligence and networking technology, cybersecurity becomes an important area of research. Domain name system (DNS) has been an essential aspect of cyber security and a crucial part of internet services. The nameservers are responsible for the functionality and safety of their corresponding domain names. But due to the laggings of proper security and DNS misconfiguration, there is a chance to takeover subdomain from the assigned external services e.g., cloud platform, e-commerce or content delivery service, which can lead to several high severity risks. Due to trackless and easier exploitation effort, subdomain hijacking has become an alluring attack vector among the hackers, which raise serious concern on cyber security. This paper focuses on comprehensive analysis on subdomain takeover and figures out the security vulnerability reason and attack scenarios. Element for subdomain enumeration, subdomain takeover process and finally, a proposed inclusive prevention model of subdomain takeover have been discussed throughout the paper."

This paper analyzes the influence that whitehat worms come under from network structure. The analysis is focused on network density. Using agent-oriented Petri nets, we expressed IoT systems having different network density. Through the simulation evaluation of the model, we revealed that if the network density is low, the white-hat worms become inefficient. In addition, based on the result we proposed a basic strategy for BDS: If a given IoT system has low network density, the BDS should launch as many worms as possible."
9624857,User Role Identification in Software Vulnerability Discussions over Social Networks,"Understanding and early awareness of software vulnerabilities is vital for preventing and mitigating potential impacts from cybersecurity events. One step toward early characterization of software vulnerabilities may involve analyzing discussion and spread of information in online social networks. Prior work has used information from such discussions over multiple online forums to develop dynamic networks among users followed by analysis of structure, spread, and information evolution. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art by focusing on data-driven learning of types, roles, and transition of roles exhibited by users over time. In social networks, users take on particular roles based on their actions and structure of the network. Identifying “meaningful” roles can help separate potential users of interest from the larger community, and identify patterns in a network relevant for generating early insights into the extent of software vulnerabilities. We identify and compare roles found in online forums (e.g., Twitter) using feature-based Non-negative Matrix Factorization coupled with topological and influence-based measures of centrality. Since users’ activities change over time, we also analyze role evolution in dynamic networks."

Remote attacks on the SAE J1939 protocol based on controller access network (CAN) bus for heavy-duty ground vehicles can lead to detectable changes in the physical characteristics of the vehicle. In this paper, I develop an unsupervised learning approach to monitor the normal behavior within the CAN bus data and detect malicious traffic. The J1939 data packets have some text-based features that I convert to numerical values. In addition, I propose an algorithm based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering that considers multiple approaches for linkages and pairwise distances between observations. I present prediction performance results to show the effectiveness of this ensemble algorithm. In addition to in-vehicle network security, this algorithm is also transferrable to other cybersecurity datasets, including botnet attacks in traditional enterprise IP networks."

Since many companies have decided to store their data in cloud services, it is extremely important to provide information security in general. Thus, the most vulnerable point is the authentication process. In this paper the requirements for information technology protection based on SRP protocol were defined. Also the architecture of next generation data center based on cloud computing was developed."
9018470,An Improved Security Scheme for IEC 61850 MMS Messages in Intelligent Substation Communication Networks,"Advanced connectivity in substations brings along cybersecurity considerations. Especially, the use of standardized data objects and message structures stipulated by IEC 61850 makes them much more vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation. In order to tackle these vulnerabilities, different methods are investigated by researchers all over the world. An important aspect of such efforts is the real-time performance consideration since power systems are bound by the rules of physics and all control/communication tasks need to be completed in a certain time frame. Security schemes for substation communication have been proposed in the recent literature. However, they must be improved to ensure a full security solution. Recently published IEC 62351 standard aims to fill this gap. Node authentication is vital for substation communication networks based on IEC 61850 to mitigate a variety of attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

However, this opens healthcare organisations' systems to external elements used within or beyond their premises, new risks and vulnerabilities in what regards cyber threats and incidents. We propose the creation of a Security Assessment as a Service (SAaaS) crosslayered system that is able to identify vulnerabilities and proactively assess and mitigate threats in an IT healthcare ecosystem exposed to external devices and interfaces, considering that most users are not experts (even technologically illiterate"") in cyber security and, thus, unaware of security tactics or policies whatsoever. The SAaaS can be integrated in an IT healthcare environment allowing the monitoring of existing and new devices, the limitation of connectivity and privileges to new devices, assess a device's cybersecurity risk and - based on the device's behaviour - the assignment and revoking of privileges. The SAaaS brings a controlled cyber aware environment that assures security, confidentiality and trust, even in the presence of non-trusted devices and environments."

In this study, we propose a software-defined framework that improves network intrusion detection systems by using manufacturer usage description (MUD) to enhance the behavioral monitoring in IoT networks. We aim to explore whether industrial IoT devices typically serve a common role in cyber-physical systems, and their communications exhibit predictable patterns that can be defined in MUD profile(s) formally and succinctly. We design a framework that utilizes the concept of digital twins and software-defined networking to improve the security of Industrial IoT environments. The MUD data are profiled, and the actions are evaluated on the network digital twin before they are used in the physical network. The behavioral profiling system is updated in real time, thereby improving the overall system security and compliance to policies in the IoT deployment. Evaluation results show that our solution outperforms existing approaches substantially in terms of attack detection accuracy, predicting security incidents, response time, and resource usage."

The cybersecurity industry is often disinclined to adopt new technologies due to perceived complications, assumed dependencies, and unclear information about the benefits. Putting the right information security architecture into practice within an organization can be an intimidating challenge. Many organizations have enforced a security information and event management (SIEM) system to comply with the logging requirements of various security standards, only to find that it does not meet their information security expectations. They do not get the benefit of the value they spend on the proprietary SIEM tools. The solution should be simple, affordable, and maintainable with readily available resources and open-source products. The aim of this study is to understand honeypot technologies, networkbased intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS), and their implementation in a scalable security operation center (SOC) environment with the help of open-source tools which would include monitoring and investigation. Based on our learning, we have designed a virtualized SOC environment protected with firewall solution like pfSense, threat hunting solution like Security Onion which can be used for monitoring network traffic both internally and externally, further integrated with honeypot technology, i.e., T-Pot for better security enhancements. Threat intelligence information from this study is used to prepare, prevent, and identify cyber threats looking to take advantage of valuable resources.

9514775,2 Honeynet – Deploying a Connected System of Diverse Honeypots Using Open-Source Tools,"stract:
Cybersecurity is a game of cat-and-mouse where the attackers have an advantage over the defenders. Defenders need to protect their assets against all possible attacks, whereas an attacker needs to find just one vulnerability to succeed in their malicious objective. Traditional protection and detection mechanisms are mostly based on known facts and known attack vectors. They work on prevention, detection, and response mechanism but does not give enough information about an attacker. Many vulnerabilities are not even detected until an attacker has already exploited it. In order for defenders to stay a step ahead, they need to know the objective of the attacker and the methods, strategies, and tools they employ. By knowing their attack strategies, early action can be taken by way of improved countermeasures and vulnerability fixes. Intelligence on attacker behavior is a valuable asset for the defending side to predict and prevent attacks. Such intelligence can be obtained using deception technologies like honeypots and honeynets. Honeypot is an extremely crucial threat intelligence weapon in a defender’s arsenal. Honeypots can be customized to replicate a fake copy of the real production environment and made lucrative to attackers. By analyzing attacks on the honeypot, defenders can observe and learn first-hand attacker behavior, attack patterns, network vulnerabilities, and potential system flaws. This will provide useful insights and actionable intelligence that can be applied to the real production systems to secure and protect them. This chapter will address the design and implementation of such a system of honeypots. It covers the high volume logging mechanisms, automated analysis of attacks/accesses, and the intelligence and insights derived from the threat logs/data. It will also cover manual threat analysis and the correlation of threat intelligence from other similar honeypots and published vulnerabilities.

8802499,Designing Serious Games for Cyber Ranges: A Socio-technical Approach,"Appropriate training is an effective solution to tackle the evolving threat landscape and conflicts in the cyber domain and to fulfill security requirements. Serious games demonstrate pedagogic effectiveness in this field, however, they need to comply with national, organizational, and individual strategies and characteristics. These games provide the players, individually or in groups, with an opportunity to develop their adversarial and system thinking skills to set up effective defenses. To this end, in this paper, we propose a framework for designing serious games that raise security awareness. The proposed framework considers the complex nature of the cyber domain, the knowledge and motivation of participants, and the experiential learning using cyber ranges. The framework is based on existing frameworks, and integrates their advantages to form a comprehensive framework. Future research should refine the framework and design serious games to evaluate its effectiveness in producing desired end results."
9680296,Oppositional Human Factors in Cybersecurity: A Preliminary Analysis of Affective States,"The need for cyber defense research is growing as more cyber-attacks are directed at critical infrastructure and other sensitive networks. Traditionally, the focus has been on hardening system defenses. However, other techniques are being explored including cyber and psychological deception which aim to negatively impact the cognitive and emotional state of cyber attackers directly through the manipulation of network characteristics. In this study, we present a preliminary analysis of survey data collected following a controlled experiment in which over 130 professional red teamers participated in a network penetration task that included cyber deception and psychological deception manipulations [7]. Thematic and inductive analysis of previously un-analyzed open-ended survey responses revealed factors associated with affective states. These preliminary results are a first step in our analysis efforts and show that there are potentially several distinct dimensions of cyber-behavior that induce negative affective states in cyber attackers, which may serve as potential avenues for supplementing traditional cyber defense strategies."
9225107,SEkey: A Distributed Hardware-based Key Management System,"Cryptography plays a key role in all the aspects of today cybersecurity and any cryptographic approach relies on cryptographic keys, i.e., series of bits that determine how a plain text is encrypted and decrypted, according to an agreed algorithm. The secrecy and security of an encryption key are thus crucial and fundamental: if the cryptographic key is compromised and known, everyone can decrypt a text encrypted according to the strongest encryption algorithm. As a consequence, several Key Management Systems (KMS) have been developed to easily support the management of cryptographic keys, whose number is constantly increasing, due to the amount of devices and communications that take place today, even in very restricted contexts. SEkey is a key management system developed targeting a distributed environment, where it is possible to identify a single central manager that acts as a Key Distribution Center (KDC) and many users that locally store and manage their own keys. Users, to a certain extent, can also work `offline' without being always in direct communication with the central manager. SEkey is built leveraging the functionalities and physical properties of the SEcube™ Hardware Security Module (HSM). All the key values and critical information are stored inside the SEcube™ and never leave the device in clear, and all the cryptographic operations are performed by the SEcube™ itself.

It is estimated that about 38.5 billion IoT devices will be connected by 2020. These devices are used in every part of life. Large number of data are collected by these IoT devices and transmitted from one device to another and from devices to enterprise systems. As large numbers of devices are connected with each other and to the world network and the number is increasing every day, there is a major risk of security threat, vulnerabilities, data manipulation, stealing, identity, device manipulation, and hacking. Due to the ease of automation and digitization, these devices bring with them numerous security issues. Poor security of these devices can provide an entry point for cyberattacks which may compromise sensitive data, threaten users' privacy and weaponize the device. The IoT ecosystem needs proper security at device level, application level, and network level. Different vendors with diverse goals but inadequate cybersecurity expertise manufacture these devices. The purpose of this paper is to identify the current security and privacy issues in IoT devices and propose recommendations for the solution of Cyber security issues in IoT devices."
9138225,Proficiency Testing for Software Analysis and Cybersecurity Laboratories,"Proficiency tests are a central activity in demonstrating the competence of accredited laboratories. In the present work, we developed a proposal for the realization of Proficiency Testing for laboratories that work in the areas of software testing and cybersecurity. This is the first example of a Proficiency Testing round focusing on software code analysis activities, an important activity in software compliance assessment programs. The proposed approach uses code coverage metrics to evaluate the ability of laboratories in evaluating the source code of a software. We prove the feasibility of the proposal through the execution of a proficiency test “round” with the participation of six laboratories accredited to conduct software tests in compliance assessment programs in Brazil."
8895368,A Holistic Approach - How to Achieve the State-of-art in Cybersecurity for a Secondary Distribution Automation Energy System Applying the IEC 62443 Standard,"Recent events have shown that critical infrastructure systems such as Secondary Distribution Automation (SDA) networks are in focus on the world scene because it has suffered constant cyber-attacks. This high exposure to cybernetic risks is due to the fact that these systems have a relatively low level of protection maturity. Concern about protecting these systems against attacker actions has been growing as the impacts of such intrusions have serious financial consequences, threaten the loss of intellectual property and generally harm the company's image on the market. In order to address the cybersecurity issue of these critical systems from a holistic point of view, the analysis should be based on an international standard addressing the subject in question: IEC 62443. This standard represents an international agreement on best security practices for Industrial Automation Control Systems (IACS). IEC 62443 takes a broad approach and addresses multiple defense concepts by applying a mechanism known as defense in depth, whose purpose is to stop the attacker's action through multiple layers of protection, defining security levels for each layer. The focus of this work is to apply the IEC 62443 Standard in a standard SDA energy system to test the application of the standard, particularly chapter 3-3, in order to achieve acceptable levels of security in the installations."
9595697,A Model Predictive Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles Cybersecurity,"Nowadays, many vehicles are connected to the Internet for providing enhanced or additional functionalities to drivers. However, the existing vehicle communication protocols are not designed for cybersecurity. As a result, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are exposed to hacker attacks which could jeopardize the safety of passengers. In this paper, a novel Informative Model Predictive Scheme (I-MPS) against Replay Attacks (RAs) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks for AVs is proposed. The effectiveness of the scheme is shown by numerical simulations of an autonomous vehicles during an overtaking and is compared against a typical architecture not implementing the I-MPS."
9176998,Cybersecurity Challenges Associated With the Internet of Things in a Post-Quantum World,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm connecting billions of devices securely to the Internet. Another emerging paradigm is quantum computing which - while opening new compute opportunities - was shown to jeopardise most cybersecurity protocols. In this study, we discuss techniques able to provide security in a post-quantum IoT. Specifically, we examine how the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) IoT security solutions fair in a post-quantum environment. Also, we analyse the security features of fifth-generation (5G) networks, propose improvements and discuss the manner in which a quantum computer can compromise security. Our results prove the existence of multiple vulnerabilities in the current IoT architecture and implementations. With advances in quantum computing having rendered the current security algorithms unsafe, more advanced techniques should be established to mitigate such risks. To this end, we present promising lattice-driven cryptographic techniques which we prove quantum resistance."
9548589,Cybersecurity Analysis of Wind Farm SCADA Systems,"Industry 4.0 or also known as the fourth industrial revolution poses a great cybersecurity risk for Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Nowadays, lots of enterprises have turned into renewable energy and are changing the energy dependency to be on wind power. The SCADA systems are often vulnerable against different kinds of cyberattacks and thus allowing intruders to successfully and intrude exfiltrate different wind farm SCADA systems. During our research a future concept testbed of a wind farm SCADA system is going to be introduced. The already existing real-world vulnerabilities that are identified are later on going to be demonstrated against the test SCADA wind farm system."
9093857,Efficiently Encrypting Color Images With Few Details Based on RC6 and Different Operation Modes for Cybersecurity Applications,"Recently, massive research works have been accomplished for augmenting privacy and security requirements for cybersecurity applications in wireless communication networks. This is attributed to the fact that conventional security processes are not appropriate for robust, efficient, and reliable multimedia streaming over unsecure media. Therefore, this paper presents an efficient color image cryptosystem based on RC6 with different modes of operation. The proposed cryptosystem is composed of two phases: encryption and decryption. The encryption phase starts by decomposing the color plainimage with few details into its RGB components, which in turn, are segmented into 128-bit blocks. These blocks are then enciphered using RC6 with an appropriate mode of operation. After that, the corresponding enciphered blocks of RGB components are multiplexed for constructing the final cipherimage. This scenario is reversed in the decryption phase. The performance of the proposed cryptosystem is gauged via simulation using a set of encryption quality metrics. The simulation results reveal that the proposed cryptosystem with cipher block chaining (CBC), cipher feedback (CFB), and output feedback (OFB) modes can efficiently and effectively hide all information of the color images with few details even in the presence of some input blocks with similar data. On the other hand, the results show that the electronic codebook (ECB) mode is not effective at all in hiding all details of images. Finally, the obtained results ensure the applicability of the proposed cryptosystem and its efficiency in encrypting images in terms of security, encryption quality, and noise immunity."

9468295,Quantum Communication for Post-Pandemic Cybersecurity,"Current approaches to cybersecurity will become increasingly inadequate as the use of networks grows and hacking becomes more skilled. One response to this problem lies in quantum technologies. In particular, the extreme sensitivity of quantum communication makes interference readily detectable and can provide secure encryption-key distribution. However, this is likely to benefit primarily high-value networks that use encryption, leaving insecure the growing use of mass networks for distributed work. The options to approaching this conundrum are (1) to accept where quantum technology leads, (2) to accelerate the technology in general without regard to how it is used, or (3) to push the technology to include mass use. We recommend a public-private strategy for the United States and its allies to effect both high-end and mass use. 11 The authors would especially like to acknowledge Professor Nathalie de Leon of the Princeton Quantum Initiative, Princeton University, whose input on quantum science has been invaluable. Errors in this paper are, of course, ours."
8770037,"Blockchain Secured Electronic Health Records: Patient Rights, Privacy and Cybersecurity","There have been significant efforts in the UK to embrace health technology to improve provisions of care. Yet, healthcare offers unique challenges to innovation, particularly with regard to data siloing. Blockchain is a shared distributed ledger technology that decentralises information storage with the potential to improve health outcomes by concurrently optimising data sharing practices and data privacy. In this paper, we explore how blockchain technology may facilitate the handling of health data in the context of regulatory frameworks, patient rights, cybersecurity and provider-centric perspectives. This is essential if this developing technology is to be considered for implementation at scale."
8870147,Characterizing Attacker Behavior in a Cybersecurity Penetration Testing Competition,Background: Inculcating an attacker mindset (i.e. learning to think like an attacker) is an essential skill for engineers and administrators to improve the overall security of software. Describing the approach that adversaries use to discover and exploit vulnerabilities to infiltrate software systems can help inform such an attacker mindset. Aims: Our goal is to assist developers and administrators in inculcating an attacker mindset by proposing an approach to codify attacker behavior in cybersecurity penetration testing competition. Method: We use an existing multimodal dataset of events captured during the 2018 National Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC'18) to characterize the approach a team of attackers used to discover and exploit vulnerabilities. Results: We collected 44 events to characterize the approach that one of the participating teams took to discover and exploit seven vulnerabilities. We used the MITRE ATT&CK ™ framework to codify the approach in terms of tactics and techniques. Conclusions: We show that characterizing attackers' campaign as a chronological sequence of MITRE ATT&CK ™ tactics and techniques is feasible. We hope that such a characterization can inform the attacker mindset of engineers and administrators in their pursuit of engineering secure software systems.
9045430,Game theoretic approach applied in cybersecurity information exchange framework,"In CYBersecurity information EXchange (CYBEX) framework, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is shared among multiple organizations with a view of creating situational awareness. But there is a possibility that malicious organizations coexist with regular ones in this framework, which can get hold of the threat data shared by other organizations and can use it for carrying out malicious activities. We formulate the aforementioned problem as an incomplete information game assuming that whenever CYBEX receives any information, it processes the information for anomaly detection. We find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium probabilities and corresponding Bayesian belief updates. We simulate the game to find the best response strategies with which regular and malicious organizations can play to increase their payoffs. Based on the best response strategies of organizations, we analyze that achieving more anomaly detection rate while keeping the processing rate minimum is the best action strategy with which CYBEX can play to increase the gain of both CYBEX and regular organizations over malicious organizations. We also find the approximate average minimum processing rate and anomaly detection rate with which CYBEX can play in order to maintain the payoff of itself and regular organizations higher than the malicious ones."
9073551,Feature Driven Learning Framework for Cybersecurity Event Detection,"Cybersecurity event detection is a crucial problem for mitigating effects on various aspects of society. Social media has become a notable source of indicators for detection of diverse events. Though previous social media based strategies for cyber-security event detection focus on mining certain event-related words, the dynamic and evolving nature of online discourse limits the performance of these approaches. Further, because these are typically unsupervised or weakly supervised learning strategies, they do not perform well in an environment of biased samples, noisy context, and informal language which is routine for online, user-generated content. This paper takes a supervised learning approach by proposing a novel multi-task learning based model. Our model can handle diverse structures in feature space by learning models for different types of potential high-profile targets simultaneously. For parameter optimization, we develop an efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through extensive experiments on a real world Twitter dataset, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods at encoding and identifying cyber-security incidents."
8662168,Attack Scenario-based Validation of the Idaho CPS Smart Grid Cybersecurity Testbed (ISAAC),"The use of smart and distributed devices is increasing in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). The smart and distributed devices are capable of extensive inter- and intra- networking. Consequently, cyber attack attempts against CPS have been increasing in recent years. The potential for widespread loss of resources for utilities is high if a cyber-attack is executed successfully on a CPS. Realistic and comprehensive cyber-physical testbeds are becoming increasingly necessary to analyze and secure CPS organizations. One such comprehensive and realistic testbed, ISAAC - the Idaho CPS Smart Grid Cybersecurity Testbed, was previously presented. Validating testbeds with realistic experiments is of paramount importance in increasing the usability of a testbed. We present a mapping of ISAAC to the Purdue reference model. We also validate ISAAC by performing a realistic attack-scenario on the testbed. Our results indicate that ISAAC can simulate realistic scenarios."
