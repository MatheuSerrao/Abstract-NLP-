9495350,V2I based environment perception for autonomous vehicles at intersections,"In recent years, autonomous driving technology has made good progress, but the noncooperative intelligence of vehicle for autonomous driving still has many technical bottlenecks when facing urban road autonomous driving challenges. V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communication is a potential solution to enable cooperative intelligence of vehicles and roads. In this paper, the RGB-PVRCNN, an environment perception framework, is proposed to improve the environmental awareness of autonomous vehicles at intersections by leveraging V2I communication technology. This framework integrates vision feature based on PVRCNN. The normal distributions transform(NDT) point cloud registration algorithm is deployed both on onboard and roadside to obtain the position of the autonomous vehicles and to build the local map objects detected by roadside multi-sensor system are sent back to autonomous vehicles to enhance the perception ability of autonomous vehicles for benefiting path planning and traffic efficiency at the intersection. The field-testing results show that our method can effectively extend the environmental perception ability and range of autonomous vehicles at the intersection and outperform the PointPillar algorithm and the VoxelRCNN algorithm in detection accuracy."
8468054,A Rotation-Free Wireless Power Transfer System With Stable Output Power and Efficiency for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"This letter proposes a rotation-free wireless power transfer system based on a new coil structure to achieve stable output power and efficiency against rotational misalignments for charging autonomous underwater vehicles. The new coil structure has two decoupled receivers composed of two reversely wound receiver coils and the magnetic flux directions of the two receivers are perpendicular to each other, guaranteeing a relatively constant total mutual inductance and a decoupled characteristic under rotational misalignments. The proposed coil structure is verified via finite element analysis based on ANSYS Maxwell. A rotation-free LCC-LCC compensated WPT prototype is built and the experimental results verify the theoretical analysis and simulations. The system can deliver 664 W with a dc-dc efficiency of 92.26% under the best case and 485 W with a 92.10% dc-dc efficiency under the worst case."
9267905,An Adaptive Mapping Strategy for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"This paper specifically focuses on the control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in mapping ocean processes. An adaptive control algorithm is proposed in this paper to control the heading of an AUV. The algorithm can be used to control a scout AUV typically used in multi-vehicle strategies to search for areas with potential rich information before secondary vehicles are called to further investigate the areas. Two control algorithms, proportional, integral and derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic, were compared based on their simplicity and practicality to be applied in the proposed adaptive sampling strategy. Simulation results indicated that the proposed strategy had the potential to be used for mapping oceanographic features in field trials. The results also showed that the fuzzy logic control was less sensitive to the change in its parameters compared to the PID when used in the proposed algorithm."
9714944,Autonomous Vehicle: What Legal Issues?,"stract:
The debate on the regulation of the so‐called “autonomous” vehicle is raging and is a hot topic for both the general public and professionals in the sector, such as car manufacturers and innovative companies. The autonomous vehicle is a vehicle capable of reacting by itself, in accordance with specific rules. The notion of the “driver” is a major one in the law of civil liability. It is indeed around this key component that road regulations were built. Legal custody is characterized by the powers of use, control and direction that a person exercises over a thing or a person. The distinction made between the driver and non‐driver should be abolished in order to provide for a more uniform compensation scheme reflecting different cases, integrating the concept of “passenger”, in particular. The implementation of optional insurance alongside compulsory insurance is perfectly possible in regard to autonomous vehicles."
9317333,An Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning Method based On Dynamic Programming,"In this article, we propose a new approach to solve local motion planning problem in autonomous vehicle field. Instead of generating several primitives and choosing the optimal trajectory from that, we get the future T time step horizon's vehicle state, and fit that into clothoid local trajectory by solving a dynamic programming problem. The trajectory generated is smooth enough and meet both ego vehicle's dynamics and traffic regulation's constraints. Iterate this process, the ego autonomous vehicle can obtain its future trajectory continuously. This method has a good performance in the simulation using Matlab and Prescan. This method has fast computing speed to apply on autonomous vehicle driving in real road online compared to other methods."
9334665,A Maneuver-based Urban Driving Dataset and Model for Cooperative Vehicle Applications,"Short-term future of automated driving can be imagined as a hybrid scenario in which both automated and human-driven vehicles co-exist in the same environment. In order to address the needs of such road configuration, many technology solutions such as vehicular communication and predictive control for automated vehicles have been introduced in the literature. Both aforementioned solutions rely on driving data of the human driver. In this work, we investigate the currently available driving datasets and introduce a real-world maneuver-based driving dataset that is collected during our urban driving data collection campaign. We also provide a model that embeds the patterns in maneuver-specific samples. Such model can be employed for classification and prediction purposes."
9359043,Development of a Prototype EV Autonomous Vehicle for Systematic Research,"The advent of artificial intelligence has introduced new and innovative developments in the public transport that are progressing towards Autonomous Vehicles, or Robot Vehicles. Consequently, this highly sophisticated technology is projected to revolutionize the automotive field.The prototype EV autonomous vehicle presented in this paper is a jointly designed by the Taiwan-based Acer Company and STUST University. The main control system is realized with a CompactRIO controller for real-time IVN (In-Vehicle Networking) signal processing and communication. An NB-IOT function based hardware SIM7000_TE [1] is employed for vehicle-to-cloud communication. Based on this scheme, associated data, such as speed, location and time, can be obtained and stored in the cloud database."
9267927,Cooperative Multiple Formation Control of Autonomous Marine Vehicles,"The general problem of Cooperative Control of multiple heterogeneous vehicles in the presence of severe communication constraints and external disturbances is pervasive in a large spectrum of scientific and commercial applications where groups of vehicles are required to carry out missions that cannot possible be achieved with a single vehicle [1] . It is important to stress that cooperation in the sense adopted here cannot be reduced to scheduling the actions of each and every vehicle in a group using a common time frame according to some pre-defined plan and dispatching specific sub-missions to each vehicle, which will then be asked to execute a specific task with only scarce information being exchanged among the group (.e.g. fast covering of the seabed by using a group of vehicles, each one of them in charge of acquiring visual and acoustic data over specific portions of the terrain). In the scope of many practical scientific and practical applications, far more complex missions must be addressed that require the concerted operation of groups of vehicles towards completion of a given goal (for example, cooperative motion control of ASVs and AUVs for acoustic and visual surveying). In this situation, the vehicles must necessarily exchange motion-related or environmental-related information parsimoniously and fulfil the mission objectives by adopting a distributed (non-centralized) decision architecture."
9310743,Space-air-ground integrated vehicular network for connected and automated vehicles: Challenges and solutions,"Unlimited and seamless coverage as well as ultra-reliable and low-latency communications are vital for connected vehicles, in particular for new use cases like autonomous driving and vehicle platooning. In this paper, we propose a novel Space-Air-Ground integrated vehicular network (SAGiven) architecture to gracefully integrate the multi-dimensional and multi-scale context-information and network resources from satellites, High-Altitude Platform stations (HAPs), low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and terrestrial cellular communication systems. One of the key features of the SAGiven is the reconfigurability of heterogeneous network functions as well as network resources. We first give a comprehensive review of the key challenges of this new architecture and then provide some up-to-date solutions on those challenges. Specifically, the solutions will cover the following topics: (1) space-air-ground integrated network reconfiguration under dynamic space resources constraints; (2) multi-dimensional sensing and efficient integration of multi-dimensional context information; (3) real-time, reliable, and secure communications among vehicles and between vehicles and the SAGiven platform; and (4) a holistic integration and demonstration of the SAGiven. Finally, it is concluded that the SAGiven can play a key role in future autonomous driving and Internet-of-Vehicles applications."
9351650,Stability Control of Autonomous Ground Vehicles Using Control-Dependent Barrier Functions,"In the development of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), guaranteeing vehicle driving safety is a major concern. Among various aspects that need to be thoughtfully considered for driving safety, vehicle stability is one of the most fundamental and important factors. In this paper, to describe a guaranteed vehicle stability control problem, a new time-varying control-dependent invariant set is introduced. Correspondingly, the concept of a time-varying control-dependent barrier function (CDBF) is proposed. The proposed time-varying CDBF is more general than conventional control barrier functions (CBF), since we additionally consider invariant sets that can be time-varying and control-dependent, which will have broader applications. Then, using the proposed framework, we design a vehicle stability control algorithm, which guarantees that the vehicle states are always kept in the time-varying and control-dependent lateral stability regions. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed theory and control method are verified and discussed through illustrative simulation results of high-speed J-turn and double lane change maneuvers for an AGV."

9024852,Design of an autonomous electric single-seat vehicle based on environment recognition algorithms,"Today's autonomous vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors, control techniques and actuators depending on the objectives and requirements of the addressing issue. In research, some even employ commercial cars to house their devices. The high cost of all these components represents a limitation in the development of an autonomous vehicle system. Therefore, researchers have no option but to rely on experimentation under simulated environments or to use small vehicles that in many cases do not accurately represent a real parametric dynamic system. This article describes the design of an autonomous electric vehicle prototype, which includes control systems, microcontrollers, encoders, motor controllers, LIDAR, and cameras, with the aim of having a reference in the literature that is low-cost and whose program code is employable in a real-life context. The present vehicle, whose structure is based on a conventional tubular go-kart, has been provided with the capability of moving autonomously by using computer vision and artificial intelligence algorithms. This document records the first steps of the design taking into account parameters of a real-life environment and the flexibility of A.I. algorithms."
8734460,Exploring Hydrothermal Deposits with Multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"This paper presents the results of marine survey of hydrothermal deposits in Okinawa trough area and Izu-Ogasawara ocean area using multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (called “C-AUV2”, “C-AUV3”, “C-AUV4”, and “Hobalin” in this paper). We have developed the compact and low-cost AUV system for multiple vehicle operation and cooperative behavior in Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) [1]-[7]. The system doesn't require the support of dedicated research vessels because of the flexibility of the system. In order to explore the hydrothermal deposit sites, the AUV system obtains the seabed topography using multi-beam echo sounder (MBES) and the optical images of the research area with cameras. In 2018, the cruise for exploration of hydrothermal deposit sites with the multiple vehicles was conducted in Izu-Ogasawara area. The topography obtained with cruising type AUV (“C-AUV2”, “C-AUV3”, “C-AUV4”) can use for zooming up the position of hydrothermal chimney, and hovering type AUV (“Hobalin”) conducts the optical observation of observable areas. Through this cruise, we researched the uninvestigated area, and discovered the hydrothermal chimney from topography and optical images."

The research uses Quanser's Autonomous QCar and QDrone to demonstrate the results. This heterogeneous powerline inspection system consists of three separately controlled elements that work collaboratively within a centralized controlled space and those individual elements are as follows: 1) A control system operated by the human that takes cares of the Autonomous car and drone functionality, 2) An autonomous unmanned ground vehicle system that will take tasks from the human control system to drive through the path determined, and 3) An autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle system that conducts the powerline search and inspection within a specified range. All three systems operate together as one heterogeneous system, which demonstrates the application of human-robotic teaming. This paper will demonstrate how the proposed system architecture is constructed and the results obtained from it in an indoor environment is discussed."
9267942,Development of a Multi-Platform Obstacle Avoidance System for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Undertaking world-class ocean science requires data gathering in some of the world's most extreme environments, such as under polar ice, deep benthic habitats and underwater canyons. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are often employed for these tasks, as these stable, untethered, vehicles are able to access areas not reachable with conventional ship-based sampling methods. It is easy to understand how deployments in such scenarios require the AUV to be equipped with appropriate sensors to perceive obstacles within its environment as well as suitable collision avoidance control schemes to maintain safe operation.The Marine Autonomous and Robotic Systems (MARS) group at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) develops and operates multiple AUVs suited for missions in a range of extreme environments. Recently, a considerable effort has been made to develop the NOC On-board Control System (OCS) for AUVs, a unified software architecture able to adapt to different platforms and to provide greater flexibility and extensibility in terms of underwater autonomy. Within this framework, a new Obstacle Avoidance System (OAS) is being developed. The goal is to design a flexible and modular system able to work effectively with different vehicles and in different scenarios, and to satisfy diverse science requirements.This paper will describe the OAS and its components, its integration within the OCS, and its interaction with the preexisting on-board autonomy and guidance systems when dealing with collisions and obstacles in the context of autonomous navigation."
8626459,Autonomous Vehicles: Autodriver Algorithm and Vehicle Dynamics,"A given road can be expressed mathematically in a global (or world) coordinate frame. Following the road can be substituted by following the loci of its curvature center and turning at the right circle of curvature. Considering that a vehicle in motion is always in turn about an instantaneous rotation center relative to the ground, an autonomous vehicle capable of following a given path by coinciding the rotation center of vehicle at every moment on the curvature center of the road could be designed. The dynamic reactions of the vehicle influence its path of motion and make its rotation center to depart from the desired path of the curvature center of the road. In this study, the Autodriver algorithm control strategy to front-wheel-steering vehicles has been developed and a control loop is introduced to compensate the present errors generated by the differences of the desired locating on the road and the real position of the vehicle."
9709187,Cooperative Formation of Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Traffic Flow: Beyond Platooning,"Cooperative formation and control of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promise increased efficiency and safety on public roads. In single-lane mixed traffic consisting of AVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), the prevailing platooning of multiple AVs is not the only choice for cooperative formation. In this paper, we investigate how different formations of AVs impact traffic performance from a set-function optimization perspective. We first reveal a stability invariance property and a diminishing improvement property of noncooperative formation when AVs adopt an independently designed Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) strategy. Then, we focus on the case of cooperative formation where AVs utilize a centralized optimal controller. We further investigate the corresponding optimal formation of multiple AVs using set-function optimization. Two predominant optimal formations, i.e., uniform distribution and platoon formation, emerge from extensive numerical experiments. Interestingly, platooning might have the least potential to improve traffic performance when HDVs have poor string stability behavior. These results suggest more opportunities for cooperative formation of AVs, beyond platooning, in practical mixed traffic flow."
9367649,A dynamic lane-changing trajectory planning scheme for autonomous vehicles on structured road,"Autonomous driving has the potential of revolutionizing the mode of trip for human society with improved transport safety and accessibility and reduced emissions. Trajectory planning plays a fundamental role in autonomous driving implementation. This paper proposes a lane-changing trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles on structured roads. The host vehicle collects information of the surrounding vehicles based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, and then a trajectory planning algorithm is presented to calculate a collision-free trajectory for lane changing. Accelerating, slowing down or returning to the original lane are possibly planned by the host vehicle in response to velocity changes of the surrounding vehicles. The quintic polynomial is used to represent the possible trajectories, and a cost function considering comfort and lane-changing efficiency is designed. The optimal trajectory is determined by solving a constrained optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified under different scenarios through simulations."
8942741,Design of an Autonomous Tracked Mower Robot using Vision-Based Remote Control,"Nowadays, autonomous vehicles and automated guided vehicles (AGV) are one of the most up-to-date subjects because of the readiness of the sensors, actuators, and real-time controllers. Similar to the AGV, an autonomous track mower robot was designed in this research. The mobile robot, which had a National Instruments real-time controller, was remotely controlled from a computer. Unlike to common mowers, the mower has track geometry in order to climb up a steep path. The position of the robot was controlled by two DC geared motors and feedback by using vision system. A web camera was installed on the robot to capture the environment, make a decision, and change the robot trajectory. Experiments have shown that robot can cut tall grass and operate in a specific task."
8854803,Soft-Switching Proximate Time Optimal Heading Control for Underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"In this paper, a soft-switching proximate time-optimal control (PTOC) is proposed based on the model-compensation extended state observer (ESO) and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy switching, for the fast set-heading tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). First, based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, a time-optimal control (TOC) law is derived for the first-order Nomoto model of the underactuated AUV. Then, a model-compensation active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is developed; the outstanding characteristic is that the nonlinear heading dynamic model is compensated to a first-order Nomoto model rather than by a double integral system through implementing a model-compensation ESO (MC-ESO). The regular ESO is replaced with a reduced-order ESO (RESO) to reduce complexity, and the model-compensation RESO (MC-RESO) is designed by adding the known partial model to RESO. Based on the controller scaling method, a parameter self-tuning strategy is proposed for model-compensation ADRC (MC-ADRC) with changed plant parameters at different velocities. Finally, the soft-switching PTOC is developed for heading control, and the MC-RESO is adopted to estimate the unmeasured velocity and unknown total disturbances for feedback and compensation. The TOC with an unsaturated region (RTOC) is employed to enhance the robustness by using a switching region to replace the switching curve, and a soft-switching strategy between ADRC (near the origin) and RTOC (far from origin) is designed based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy mode. Several simulations are carried out, the effectiveness of self-tuning MC-ADRC is verified, and the proposed soft-switching PTOC shows better performance compared with MC-ADRC."
9416483,Interaction-Aware Probabilistic Trajectory Prediction of Cut-In Vehicles Using Gaussian Process for Proactive Control of Autonomous Vehicles,"This paper presents a probabilistic trajectory prediction of cut-in vehicles exploiting the information of interacting vehicles. First, a probability distribution of behavioral parameters, which represents the characteristics of lane-change motion, is obtained via Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). For this purpose, Gaussian Process (GP) models are trained using real-world trajectories of lane-changing vehicles and adjacent vehicles. Subsequently, the future states of the lane-change vehicle are probabilistically estimated using a path-following model, which introduces virtual measurements based on the information of behavioral parameters. The proposed predictor is applied to the motion planning and control of autonomous vehicles. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) is designed to achieve predictive maneuvering of autonomous vehicles against cut-in preceding vehicles. The proposed predictor has been evaluated in terms of its prediction accuracy. Also, the performance of the proposed predictor-based control has been validated via computer simulations and autonomous driving vehicle tests. Compared to conventional prediction methods, it is shown that the interaction-aware proposed predictor provides improved prediction of cut-in vehicles' motion in multi-vehicle scenarios. Furthermore, the control results indicate that the proposed predictor helps the autonomous vehicle to reduce the control effort and improve ride quality for passengers in cut-in scenarios, while guaranteeing safety."

Existing researches on autonomous vehicle technology mainly focus on avoiding obstacles; however, few studies have accounted for dynamic lane changing based on some certain assumptions, such as the lane-changing speed is constant or the terminal state is known in advance. In this study, a typical lane-changing scenario is developed with the consideration of preceding and lagging vehicles on the road. Based on the local trajectory generated by the global positioning system, a path planning model and a speed planning model are respectively established through the cubic polynomial interpolation. To guarantee the driving safety, passenger comfort and vehicle efficiency, a comprehensive trajectory optimization function is proposed according to the path planning model and speed planning model. In addition, a dynamic decoupling model is established to solve the problems of real-time application to provide viable solutions. The simulations and real vehicle validations are conducted, and the results highlight that the proposed method can generate a satisfactory lane-changing trajectory for automatic lane-changing actions."

9679716,A learning-based flexible autonomous motion control method for UAV in dynamic unknown environments,"This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based motion control method to provide unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with additional flexibility while flying across dynamic unknown environments autonomously. This method is applicable in both military and civilian fields such as penetration and rescue. The autonomous motion control problem is addressed through motion planning, action interpretation, trajectory tracking, and vehicle movement within the DRL framework. Novel DRL algorithms are presented by combining two difference-amplifying approaches with traditional DRL methods and are used for solving the motion planning problem. An improved Lyapunov guidance vector field (LGVF) method is used to handle the trajectory-tracking problem and provide guidance control commands for the UAV. In contrast to conventional motion-control approaches, the proposed methods directly map the sensorbased detections and measurements into control signals for the inner loop of the UAV, i.e., an end-to-end control. The training experiment results show that the novel DRL algorithms provide more than a 20% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. The testing experiment results demonstrate that the controller based on the novel DRL and LGVF, which is only trained once in a static environment, enables the UAV to fly autonomously in various dynamic unknown environments. Thus, the proposed technique provides strong flexibility for the controller."
9661196,LTVMPC for Dynamic Positioning of An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) need to keep the orientation and position in a dynamic positioning task against ocean currents. Then, a dynamic positioning controller combining linear time-varying model predictive control (LTVMPC) and integral sliding mode control (ISMC) is proposed. The LTVMPC is used to achieve optimal control considering input and output constraints, while the ISMC is adopted to reject external disturbances to improve robustness. Finally, numerical simulations validate the performance of the proposed dynamic positioning controller through a comparison with nonlinear MPC (NMPC) and LTVMPC without ISMC."
9315034,Safe and efficient collision avoidance control for autonomous vehicles,"We study a novel principle for safe and efficient collision avoidance that adopts a mathematically elegant and general framework making as much as possible abstraction of the controlled vehicle's dynamics and of its environment. Vehicle dynamics is characterized by pre-computed functions for accelerating and braking to a given speed. Environment is modeled by a function of time giving the free distance ahead of the controlled vehicle under the assumption that the obstacles are either fixed or are moving in the same direction. The main result is a control policy enforcing the vehicle's speed so as to avoid collision and efficiently use the free distance ahead, provided some initial safety condition holds.The studied principle is applied to the design of a synchronous controller. We show that the controller is safe by construction. Furthermore, we show that the efficiency strictly increases for decreasing granularity of discretization. We present the implementation and experimental evaluations in the Carla autonomous driving simulator and investigate various performance issues."

9242926,Benchmarking of a software stack for autonomous racing against a professional human race driver,"The way to full autonomy of public road vehicles requires the step-by-step replacement of the human driver, with the ultimate goal of replacing the driver completely. Eventually, the driving software has to be able to handle all situations that occur on its own, even emergency situations. These particular situations require extreme combined braking and steering actions at the limits of handling to avoid an accident or to diminish its consequences. An average human driver is not trained to handle such extreme and rarely occurring situations and therefore often fails to do so. However, professional race drivers are trained to drive a vehicle utilizing the maximum amount of possible tire forces. These abilities are of high interest for the development of autonomous driving software. Here, we compare a professional race driver and our software stack developed for autonomous racing with data analysis techniques established in motorsports. The goal of this research is to derive indications for further improvement of the performance of our software and to identify areas where it still fails to meet the performance level of the human race driver. Our results are used to extend our software's capabilities and also to incorporate our findings into the research and development of public road autonomous vehicles."
9205747,Creating Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"act:
This is one of the first technical overviews of autonomous vehicles written for a general computing and engineering audience. Students will find a comprehensive overview of the entire autonomous technology stack and practitioners will find many practical techniques.
Throughout the book, the authors share their practical experiences designing autonomous vehicle systems. These systems are complex, consisting of three major subsystems: (1) algorithms for localization, perception, and planning and control; (2) client systems, such as the robotics operating system and hardware platform; and (3) the cloud platform, which includes data storage, simulation, high-definition (HD) mapping, and deep learning model training. The algorithm subsystem extracts meaningful information from sensor raw data to understand its environment and make decisions as to its future actions. The client subsystem integrates these algorithms to meet real-time and reliability requirements. The cloud platform provides offline computing and storage capabilities for autonomous vehicles. Using the cloud platform, new algorithms can be tested so as to update the HD map—in addition to training better recognition, tracking, and decision models.

9662668,Fixed-Dimensional and Permutation Invariant State Representation of Autonomous Driving,"In this paper, we propose a new state representation method, called encoding sum and concatenation (ESC), to describe the environment observation for decision-making in autonomous driving. Unlike existing state representation methods, ESC is applicable to the situation where the number of surrounding vehicles is variable and eliminates the need for manually pre-designed sorting rules, leading to higher representation ability and generality. The proposed ESC method introduces a feature neural network (NN) to encode the real-valued feature of each surrounding vehicle into an encoding vector, and then adds these vectors up to obtain the representation vector of the set of surrounding vehicles. Then, a fixed-dimensional and permutation-invariance state representation can be obtained by concatenating the set representation with other variables, such as indicators of the ego vehicle and road. By introducing the sum-of-power mapping, this paper has further proved that the injectivity of the ESC state representation can be guaranteed if the output dimension of the feature NN is greater than the number of variables of all surrounding vehicles. This means that the ESC representation can be used to describe the environment and taken as the inputs of learning-based policy functions. Experiments demonstrate that compared with the fixed-permutation representation method, the policy learning accuracy based on ESC representation is improved by 62.2%."

Secondly, a nonlinear extended state observer is designed to observe the uncertainty disturbance, such as external disturbance and parameter uncertainties. Finally, in order to eliminate error and reject disturbance while resisting actuator saturation, a conditional integration is developed as feedback control law.

9122409,Robust Autonomous Intersection Control Approach for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Traffic light-free intersection control is envisioned to alleviate congestion and manage vehicles intelligently. With the help of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and edge computing (EC), vehicles are instructed to cross the intersection with high vehicle safety and traffic efficiency without traffic lights. However, unstable channel conditions can lead to the reduction of traveling safety. In this paper, we propose a robust autonomous intersection control (AIC) approach with global optimization scheduling, which protects connected autonomous vehicles from collision under any channel conditions while achieving decent traffic efficiency. In particular, we propose an AIC model that gives vehicles certain autonomy under centralized control to ensure the traveling safety in case of some emergencies. By conducting an interference graph, we simplify the AIC problem as a weighted maximal clique problem with restriction. To improve the fairness and efficiency in terms of vehicle passage, multiple factors such as travel delay, traffic of the current lane and passengers' desired speed are considered. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to search the solution space. For further optimization, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed, achieving a near-optimal result with adjustable overhead. Finally, we build the simulation model and conduct a comparative performance evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme."
8962547,A Diving Autonomous Surface Vehicle for Multi-Robot Research and Development,"An economical marine vehicle was designed for environmental monitoring and field-implementation of multi-robot behaviors. This vehicle, classed as a diving autonomous surface vehicle, is capable of maneuvering along the surface using port and starboard thrusters. A variable buoyancy chamber, or buoyancy engine, allows the vehicle to take a vertical profile of the water column by pumping water into and out of a trio of actuated syringes. The operational concept of transiting along the surface and stopping to take a vertical profile, is intended to efficiently measure water column parameters in a manner suitable for expansion to multiple vehicles. Although the same task could be performed by one or more traditional autonomous underwater vehicles, the infrastructure for underwater communication and navigation is cost prohibitive at the level of efficiency achieved by the proposed fleet of diving autonomous vehicles. After progressing through two prototype phases, one vehicle is currently undergoing in-water trials.

9390363,Joint Rebalancing and Vehicle-to-Grid Coordination for Autonomous Vehicle Public Transportation System,"An Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is believed to be the next generation transport that can enhance safety and efficiency for smart mobility. In an AV-based public transportation system, the full autonomy of AVs enables high-efficiency transport services and the potential ride-sharing feature of AV system enhances the utilization. The system manages a fleet of AVs, determines their assignments to transport requests, sends instructions concerning the optimized plans, and recommends the parking locations for the unoccupied AVs. The parking location of an empty AV is crucial in the sense that rebalancing AVs to areas with high potential service demand can curtail the unnecessary waiting time for passengers. As AVs are generally electric, proper parking locations can also facilitate vehicle-to-grid (V2G) support. In this paper, we propose a joint rebalancing and V2G coordination strategy for AV-based public transportation system. We formulate the problem as an integer linear program and propose a heuristic based on Genetic Algorithm and Model Predictive Control to solve the problem in low time complexity. Extensive experiments are performed with the real taxi service data from New York City. The formulated integer linear program is solved dynamically where each problem instance contains 3 to 5 AVs and 3 to 8 requests in 30s time interval. Compared with the transport system without rebalancing, the results show that the coordination strategy is efficient and effective in reducing unnecessary waiting time for passengers while satisfying V2G support. Compared to computational time with the standard solver, the proposed heuristic dramatically reduces the computational time."
8574944,Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Homing With a Single Range-Only Beacon,"Homing behavior for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is vital for autonomous docking and indispensable for recovery of vehicles in logistically difficult or hazardous conditions. Homing to a single acoustic beacon is a low-logistics solution to this engineering challenge. A homing application has been developed in C++ that applies a multilateration-based localization algorithm to estimate transponder location for homing. Mission oriented operating suite interval programming (MOOS-IvP) was implemented as a backseat driver on a Teledyne Gavia AUV to enhance the AUV with adaptive maneuvering capabilities; thus, enabling mission waypoints to be dynamically updated by the homing application (pHomeToBeacon) through the MOOS database and a developed iGavia crewmember. To demonstrate MOOS-IvP-GAVIA and homing capabilities using this first-principles approach to localization, field trials were undertaken in Kópavogur, Iceland, in June 2015 and proved consistent homing to a single beacon within 15 m accuracy. These trials were an industry-first of deploying a user-developed application on MOOS-IvP-GAVIA and of having a Gavia enhanced with adaptive maneuvering capabilities for homing. This new capability enables Gavia AUV to be used as a platform for future developer-led autonomy and applications. Ultimately, pHomeToBeacon will enable any AUV enhanced with MOOS-IvP to use acoustics to home to a surface vessel (stationary or underway) in preparation for autonomous subsea docking and recovery."

In this study, an algorithm based on A* algorithm to solve conflict-free routing problems for multiple autonomous transport vehicles, is proposed. While classical A* algorithm plans routes for a single start and end node at the same time, the proposed algorithm plans routes for multiple start and end nodes without conflicts.

The proposed algorithm has been tested on multiple autonomous transport vehicles having different velocities (heterogeneous). Tests conducted within the scope of the study, show that the proposed algorithm finds effective conflictfree routes."

9005375,Path Following Control of Autonomous Four-Wheel-Independent-Drive Electric Vehicles via Second-Order Sliding Mode and Nonlinear Disturbance Observer Techniques,"In this article, we aim to investigate the path following control problem for four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicles with consideration of modeling errors and complex driving scenarios. In order to guarantee operational safety and robustness, a supertwisting second-order sliding mode (SOSM) control strategy is employed to suppress the heavy chattering issue existing in the traditional sliding mode control (SMC). To degrade the lumped disturbance, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) technique is proposed to estimate the disturbance and compensate the modeling error. Then, a composite control strategy, which combines the SMC algorithm and NDOB technique is proposed based on stability analysis of the corresponding closed-loop system. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop experimental results show that the supertwisting SOSM control algorithm with the NDOB technique can achieve better tracking performance and suppress the chattering phenomenon."
9591322,An Optimization-based Path Planning Approach for Autonomous Vehicles using dynEFWA-Artificial Potential Field,"With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, collision avoidance has become a research hotspot since it is strongly related to the safety issue. To generate a collision-free path, artificial potential field (APF) as a path planning method is widely used. APF is capable of establishing functional relationship between host vehicle and surrounding objects. However, since the function features of traditional APF method, it may cause the autonomous vehicles to fall into the local minimum, and the generated zigzag path might be difficult to follow. Motivated by this issue, this paper proposes a real-time path planning method for autonomous vehicles based on dynamic enhanced firework algorithm-APF. Firstly, to improve the safety and smoothness of planned path by traditional APF method, the constraints of vehicle dynamics and different types of obstacles are taken into consideration. Secondly, an optimization problem is formulated to find an optimal path with the least cost in the driving area. Finally, the proposed method is verified both in the simulation and hardware-in-loop test environment. The results show that the studied autonomous vehicle could avoid the obstacles and arrive goal position successfully by using the proposed path-planning method, and the path smoothness could also be improved."
9531563,G-VIDO: A Vehicle Dynamics and Intermittent GNSS-Aided Visual-Inertial State Estimator for Autonomous Driving,"This paper proposes G-VIDO, a vehicle dynamics, and intermittent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-aided visual-inertial state estimator, to address the state estimation problem of autonomous vehicle localization (i.e., position and orientation estimation in the global coordinate system) under various GNSS states. A dynamics pre-integration theory is proposed on the basis of a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle dynamics model, and dynamics constraints are built in the optimization back-end, considering the unobservable problem of the monocular visual-inertial system under degenerate motions. The proposed highly nonlinear system can be robustly initialized by loosely aligning the monocular structure from motion (SfM) results, pre-integrated IMU measurements, and vehicle motion information. GNSS is used for reference frame transformation and constraint construction in the sliding window. The cumulative error can be corrected with the aid of GNSS, and the vehicle's position in the global coordinate system can be determined. A GNSS anomaly detection algorithm is proposed to improve the system robustness under intermittent GNSS. Experiments have shown that G-VIDO can provide real-time, robust, and seamless localization in multiple GNSS states, with an RMSE of less than 30 cm (with GNSS). Moreover, we proved that the initialization and local odometry modules in G-VIDO outperform several state-of-the-art VIO systems and our preliminary work VINS-Vehicle."
8367854,Trajectory Tracking and Path Following for Underactuated Marine Vehicles,"In this paper, we present a control strategy for trajectory tracking and path following of generic paths for underactuated marine vehicles. Our work is inspired and motivated by previous works on ground vehicles. In particular, we extend the definition of the hand position point, introduced for ground vehicles, to autonomous surface vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles, and then use the hand position point as output for a control strategy based on the input-output feedback linearization method. The presented strategy is able to deal with external disturbances affecting the vehicle, e.g., constant and irrotational ocean currents. Using the Lyapunov analysis, we are able to prove that the closed-loop system has an external dynamics that is globally exponentially stable and an internal dynamics that has ultimately bounded states, both for the trajectory tracking and the path following control problems. Finally, we present a simulation case study and experimental results in order to validate the theoretical results."

However, the dearth of open-source, low-cost AUV platforms available for vSLAM research necessitates significant overhead for vehicle development for any underwater vSLAM research. In order to democratize access to marine robotics research we contribute a set of open-source hardware augmentations and software packages built on top of the BlueROV2 platform to allow researchers to build a low-cost Hovering AUV to facilitate autonomous vSLAM research."
8814007,Accurate Elevation Maps based Graph-Slam Framework for Autonomous Driving,"This paper introduces a Graph Slam framework for improving the accuracy of elevation-maps. The core-idea is to utilize LIDAR images in determining the relationships between the road nodes and calculate the relevant elevation constraints. Phase correlation is applied to estimate the common areas between the nodes and confirm the loop-closure events. The dead-reckoning altitudinal measurements are used to initialize the graph in order to avoid the low GPS quality and guarantee a smooth change of the map consistency. The generated elevation-maps have been compared with the GPS-RTK maps using a reliable evaluation scheme. The results have verified that the proposed method can produce elevation-maps at the same accuracy level of GPS-RTK maps in open-sky area. Moreover, it significantly recovers the low accuracy of GPS-RTK maps in critical environments. Accordingly, the generated maps can safely be used during autonomous driving with better estimation of the vehicle altitudinal position."

This paper proposes a safe and energy-saving decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles to avoid the potential rear-end collision and improve the energy efficiency in vehicle-following driving scenario. To realize this framework, the vehicle longitudinal dynamics model is first presented, and the autonomous vehicles requirements from the safety and energy efficiency perspectives are comprehensively analyzed in the vehicle-following driving scenario. Then, a two-stage decision-making framework is designed. The first stage determines the safety region in the powertrain control domain, and the second stage determines the optimal energy efficiency in the safety region. Based on the two-stage decision-making framework, the perspective of safety first principle can be enforced by simultaneously considering the driving safety and energy efficiency. Finally, the experiment is conducted to demon-strate the advantages of the proposed method by com-paring it with two other state-of-art methods."
9065851,GPS and IMU Integration on an autonomous vehicle using Kalman filter (LabView Tool),"In the case of Autonomous vehicle the Navigation of Autonomous Vehicle is an important part and the major factor for its Operation. If there's an issue or problem in terms of accuracy with the navigation system it may harmful for the vehicle and the surrounding environment. So to determine the vehicle localization and position GPS (Global Positioning System) which uses the reference geographical coordinates determine the Vehicle localization and position. But there are some drawback of the this (GPS) system which has physical barrier error, multipath error signal strength week in the tunnel near tall buildings is also need to consider in operation path of the vehicle and also the signal from the GPS get affected by surrounding environment change in the climate. So for that purpose we need the system which can not affected by environment changes and problem related to signal strength that is IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) which consists of total 6 axis i.e. 3 for acceleration in X, Y, Z direction and Gyroscope Axis in X, Y, Z axis which provides the Yaw rate, Pitch rate, Roll rate it will provide the signal in the absence of GPS signal so that IMU is a loosely coupled with GPS by using Kalman filter."
9636151,Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles that Sympathize with Human Drivers,"Widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles will not become a reality until solutions are developed that enable these intelligent agents to co-exist with humans. This includes safely and efficiently interacting with human-driven vehicles, especially in both conflictive and competitive scenarios. We build up on the prior work on socially-aware navigation and borrow the concept of social value orientation from psychology —that formalizes how much importance a person allocates to the welfare of others— in order to induce altruistic behavior in autonomous driving. In contrast with existing works that explicitly model the behavior of human drivers and rely on their expected response to create opportunities for cooperation, our Sympathetic Cooperative Driving (SymCoDrive) paradigm trains altruistic agents that realize safe and smooth traffic flow in competitive driving scenarios only from experiential learning and without any explicit coordination. We demonstrate a significant improvement in both safety and traffic-level metrics as a result of this altruistic behavior and importantly conclude that the level of altruism in agents requires proper tuning as agents that are too altruistic also lead to sub-optimal traffic flow. The code and supplementary material are available at: https://symcodrive.toghi.net/"

Firstly, a nonlinear robust controller is designed by using the sliding mode control method, and the RBF neural network control technology is used to compensate the uncertain parameters of the model and the external nonlinear disturbance. Then, the stability of the whole closed-loop system is proved by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a numerical simulation is carried out for a new underwater hexapod crawling vehicle.

9595509,Fleet Speed Profile Optimization for Autonomous and Connected Vehicles,"Cost optimization is a major concern for autonomous electric vehicles. This optimization problem becomes complicated if a group of vehicles as a fleet move along the road. Optimization based on the leading vehicle to generate the fleet speed profile might not guarantee the overall minimum cost of the fleet. In this paper, an optimization algorithm for a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles is proposed using the total cost of the fleet to generate the optimum speed profile so that the overall cost of the fleet is reduced. Maintaining a safe distance with the adjacent vehicles and safe lane changing on a multilane road depends on the accuracy of decision making based on the data coming from the embedded sensors in the autonomous vehicle. Both of those two cases can be satisfied easily if the vehicles are moving as a group on the same fleet speed where the individual speed of each vehicle can be adjusted based on the relative distance with the leading vehicle. An artificial intelligence (AI) based realistic autonomous electric vehicle modeling considering all the route conditions is provided in this paper, and optimization is done for a fleet of two vehicles where the physical models of the vehicles are different from each other. The proposed optimization algorithm shows a reduction of the total cost for the fleet compared to the optimization done based on only the leading vehicle’s cost."

9263459,Artificial Neural Network Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicle Ultrasonic Multi-Sensor System,"Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that run automatically without a driver. Therefore, the vehicle requires sensors to detect surrounding objects to avoid collisions with other objects or vehicles. A variety of sensors can be used to support the system. One of the sensors used is an ultrasonic sensor that has the reliability and robustness to various light conditions and radio waves, especially when compared to camera sensors, radar and lidar. The recent implementation of ultrasonic sensors in vehicles is limited as a parking guide, so it needs to be developed for further functions, considering that ultrasonic sonar technology has advanced with even greater detection and long distances range. Hence, as a continuation of previous research in ultrasonic sensor characteristics, this paper carries out the application of artificial neural network algorithms that get input in the form of signals that refer to the output signal from the ultrasonic sensors, which have already assembled into a multi-sensor, which is 8 (eight) ultrasonic sensors positioned around the vehicle, two sensors in the front, two sensors in the rear and four sensors in the right and left side of vehicle. The sensors and algorithms will support the autonomous vehicle system, where if the sensors detect the obstructive objects, the system will provide an output in the form of a decision to make the braking order, soft braking, turning left, turning right, or staying run straight when the front sensors do not detect a barrier object. This is done in anticipation of an accident and avoid a collision. Each condition and decision will be determined by which sensor detects the barrier object. Input and output will be simulated using the tool of artificial neural network algorithms, so as to get the most optimal weight and low error rate."

The Self driving vehicle works on the mechanism of a line following vehicle. The track is already defined and with an array of Infrared sensors mounted on the base of the vehicle, thus the accuracy of the line following is determined. Medicines are stored in a customized tray which consists of four boxes which open and close automatically using mini servo motors.

The unique identity of every box and the access (opening and closing) of an individual box is given through RFID cards. Every box can be opened only with its respective RFID card where as a Master card can access all boxes. Simultaneously a message is also sent to the Internet of Things based cloud platform regarding successful medicine delivery and intake by the patient.

9222046,Evaluating Model Predictive Path Following and Yaw Stability Controllers for Over-Actuated Autonomous Electric Vehicles,"Active safety systems are of significant importance for autonomous vehicles operating in safety-critical situations like an obstacle-avoidance manoeuvre with high vehicle speed or poor road condition. However, a conventional electronic stability control system, may not always yield desired path following and yaw stability performance in such circumstances merely through brake intervention. This paper pursues a detailed investigation on utilising model predictive control (MPC) and torque vectoring for path following and yaw stability control of over-actuated autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) in dangerous double lane change manoeuvre. The control problem of the AEV is formulated based on MPC by utilising active front steering and torque vectoring, and constraints are imposed explicitly on yaw rate and sideslip angle to ensure yaw stability. Four MPC-based controllers are designed based on double-track vehicle models. Specifically, they include two one-level controllers, i.e. one with torque vectoring and one with equal torque allocation, and two two-level controllers, i.e. one with optimisation-based torque allocation and one with rule-based allocation. These controllers are assessed extensively, with respect to passing velocity, tracking accuracy, tyre utilisation and robustness. The effect of horizon length on the control performance and computational efficiency is also investigated."

This paper proposes an approach to search for the Pareto optimal information flow topology off-line for the control of connected vehicles platoon using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Based on the obtained Pareto optimal information flow topology, the platoons overall performance in terms of three main performance indices: tracking index, acceleration standard deviation, and fuel consumption, are all improved. Numerical simulations are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the simulation, the impact of different information flow topologies on the performance of the connected autonomous vehicles platoon is firstly investigated. The results show that more communication links can lead to better tracking ability. The smoothness of the velocity profile is consistent with fuel economy, while velocity profiles smoothness, fuel economy and communication efficiency are in contrary to the tracking index. Then, five cases are discussed using the Pareto optimal information flow topology. The results indicate that while ensuring the platoons stability, the obtained Pareto optimal information flow topology can improve the tracking ability by 33.67% to 49.35%, and fuel economy by 7.181% to 16.93% and driving comfort up to 14.9%."

9543552,Terrain Adaptive Trajectory Planning and Tracking on Deformable Terrains,"In this work, a novel single-level adaptive trajectory planner and tracking controller is developed for off-road autonomous vehicles operating on deformable terrains. Trajectory planning and tracking algorithms often rely on a simplified vehicle model to predict future vehicle states based upon control inputs, hence requiring accurate modeling and parameterization. On off-road deformable terrains this is a challenging task due to unknown terrain parameters and the complex interactions at tire-terrain interfaces, which pose issues in continuous differentiability, operating conditions, and computational time. To address these difficulties, in this paper, a neural network deformable terrain terramechanics model and its implementation within a terrain adaptive model predictive control algorithm is presented to improve vehicle safety and performance through more accurate prediction of the plant response. It is shown in simulations that the neural network is able to predict the lateral tire forces accurately and efficiently compared to the Soil Contact Model as a state-of-the-art model and is able to yield accurate bicycle model predictions. It is demonstrated that the implementation of the neural network within model predictive control can outperform both a baseline Pacejka-based and a rapidly exploring random tree controller by improving performance and allowing for more severe maneuvers to be completed that otherwise lead to failure when terrain deformations are not explicitly taken into account. The improved performance achieved through estimating terrain parameters online in an adaptive controller is highlighted against the nonadaptive realization.

There is a pressing need for constructing smart charging infrastructures that can successfully integrate the large influx of connected and autonomous EVs (CAEVs) into the smart grids. To fulfill the aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) services, the proposed fast and secure framework will also need to address the long charging times and long waiting times of static charging, and will need to consider dynamic wireless charging as a viable solution for the CAEVs on the move. In this paper, a three-layer hierarchical charging infrastructure design that has interoperability with existing static wired charging systems and future wireless static and dynamic charging systems for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is presented. Charging request and reservation message frames are proposed for one of the Internet of Things application (IoT) that can enable this system to dynamically and automatically schedule charging reservations of CAEVS over one or more charging networks of different types with the shortest possible route to the destination of an AMoD trip. The hardware independent system design can detect misalignment and speed issue errors of the connected vehicles on the wireless charging pads. It employs vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to grid (V2G) communications with secure fog and cloud computing for faster computation and lower latencies. Finally, the proposed dynamic wireless charging network (DWCN) recommendation tool is analyzed, and its suggestions for building the proposed DWCN enables implementers to achieve the desired charge delivery performance at the lowest cost possible.

9492071,Parameterized Energy-Optimal Regenerative Braking Strategy for Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles: A Real-Time Dynamic Programming Approach,"This paper presents a vehicle speed planning system called the energy-optimal deceleration planning system (EDPS), which aims to maximize energy recuperation of regenerative braking of connected and autonomous electrified vehicles. A recuperation energy-optimal speed profile is computed based on the impending deceleration requirements for turning or stopping at an intersection. This is computed to maximize the regenerative braking energy while satisfying the physical limits of an electrified powertrain. To obtain smooth optimal deceleration speed profiles, optimal deceleration commands are determined by a parameterized polynomial-based deceleration model that is obtained by regression analyses with real vehicle driving test data. The design parameters are dependent on preview information such as residual time and distance as well as target speed. The key design parameter is deceleration time, which determines the deceleration speed profile to satisfy the residual time and distance constraints as well as the target speed requirement. The time-varying bounds of deceleration commands corresponding to the physical limits of the powertrain are deduced from realistic deceleration test driving. For validation and comparisons of the EDPS with different preview distances, driving simulation tests with a virtual road environment and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity are presented. It is shown that the longer preview distance in the EDPS, the more energy-recuperation. In comparison with driver-in-the-loop simulation tests, EDPS-based autonomous driving shows improvements in energy recuperation and reduction in trip time."

This paper proposes a robust ego-vehicle motion estimation to achieve precise localization and tracking, especially in the case of highly dynamic driving. An extended H ∞ filter, based on a kinematic motion model assuming constant turn-rate and acceleration is used to fuse LiDAR, IMU, and vehicle dynamic sensors' measurements. Measurements from a real high-performance autonomous race car, the so-called DevBot 2.0, have been used to validate the fusion approach in a Roborace competition and compared to a standard Kalman-filter approach.The proposed estimation concept adapts the H ∞ robustness bound based on the innovation sequence of the filter. This provides very fast tracking when it comes to highly dynamic movement, but still achieves minimal estimation uncertainty in case of stationary conditions with lower innovation. Furthermore, a pure kinematic model is used, which is robust against vehicle parameters, changes in the tire-road conditions, and changes in driving maneuvers. The resulting estimation concept shows outstanding performance for considered autonomous race scenario and can be used for a wide range of different applications, such as highway driving, urban driving, platooning, etc."

The system of ODEs has the minimum number of states and equations that enables efficient computations yet maintains the most important nonlinear vehicle dynamic behavior and allows actuator coordination and energy consumption evaluation. As examples, we build different models of a 4-unit long combination vehicle, i.e., two-track 11-axle and single-track 6-axle nonlinear models as well as a linear single-track 6-axle model. We compare the performance of these models to experimental data of different driving maneuvers. The nonlinear single-track model demonstrates close dynamic behavior to the experiment, which makes it an efficient alternative to the two-track model.

Although the general advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) architecture is widely discussed, limited details are available about the functionality of the modules and their interactions, backed up by scientific justification. This, in turn, limits the utilization of such architecture for pragmatic implementation. A cognitive ADAS architecture for level 4 autonomous-capable electrified vehicles (EVs) is proposed. Variations for levels 3 and 3.5, which are simply seen to be a combination of 3 and 4, with the primary fallback through a human driver and the secondary through an automated driving system, are also presented. A simulation framework is built for highway driving based on the proposed level 4 architecture for an enhanced Tesla Model S.

The radar used in the autonomous vehicle provides information such as the position of the objects, the relative speed, and the intensity of the signal reflection. However, it does not provide the type of the objects. In order to do autonomous driving, it is important to remove various clutters around the vehicle and accurately extract the information of the front vehicle. Therefore, there is a need for an algorithm that removes various clutter, extracts the information of the front vehicle, and tracks it.

First, the multi-parameter joint estimation based on adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) is constructed to decouple and estimate the center of gravity (CG) position, tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC), tire cornering stiffness (TCS), tire vertical force (TVF) and road slope. Then, focusing on the large lateral acceleration condition, a lateral control based on the optimal front-tire lateral force is proposed by constructing the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and combining the multi-parameter joint estimation. Additionally, a longitudinal control based on the drive and brake force compensation to realize the accurate speed tracking by combining road slop estimation is achieved.

9415170,Cooperative Driving of Automated Vehicles Using B-Splines for Trajectory Planning,"Vehicle automation is used to increase traffic throughput and road safety. Automated vehicles should be highly versatile to navigate on both highways and urban roads. To do so, fully automated autonomous vehicles often adopt motion planners to ensure collision-free and comfortable trajectories. In contrast, in cooperative driving, feedback control is often used to achieve string-stable vehicle-following at very short inter-vehicle distances. In this work, the gap between cooperative vehicle following and trajectory planning is bridged, by using a trajectory planner to generate cooperative trajectories, such that the versatility of an autonomous vehicle is retained, but cooperation is included. The presented method uses B-splines to generate cooperative trajectories. Simulations are used to demonstrate that even under large communication delays, string stable behaviour can be achieved. The use of parametrized trajectories in the form of B-splines ensures only a small number of parameters needs to be communicated between vehicles."

However, even though remotely operated vehicles routinely land during their operations, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) lack the sensing and data processing capabilities needed to identify safe, stable landing sites. Here, an algorithm is developed that uses millimeter-resolution (mm-resolution) bathymetry to detect regions where an AUV of known geometry can safely and stably land on the seafloor. The algorithm uses physical models that consider vehicle geometry, seafloor slope, roughness, friction, and currents. It can identify the most suitable of multiple candidate sites based on a landing cost function. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using seafloor bathymetry data that was obtained using an AUV equipped with a high-resolution laser mapping system on the slopes of the Takuyo Daigo seamount in the Northwest Pacific. The algorithm successfully identified multiple landing sites along a 500-m transect on the slopes of the surveyed seamount.

9057872,Fast Lane Filtering for Autonomous Vehicle,"Lane filtering is a necessary process applied after lane detection in autonomous vehicle applications. The unprocessed result from lane detection can usually be noisy. The length and position of the detected lanes are often changing abruptly across frames due to imperfect detection, which would introduce noise to downstream processes. In order to obtain steady lane detection result, we develop a new method to filter the raw output of detection. We first perform a prepossessing to filter out large obvious inconsistency. A compact lane representation is designed, to convert the various length into fixed-dimension vector representation. The general shape of the lanes is kept while a low computational complexity is maintained. We then apply the Kalman filter to perform filtering in temporal domain, and estimate the location of the lanes. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted on real data collected from vehicle driving in urban area, showing improved results compared to unprocessed lane detection results."
9348861,A Safety Gateway for Autonomous Driving Demonstrator Vehicles,"Safety for autonomous driving (AD) is currently a hot topic both in industry and research. Especially for prototype vehicles the idea prevails that engaging a safety driver is sufficient to mitigate all safety concerns. We point out, why a safety driver in several cases is unable to cope with the situation, and needs additional support from the AD system. Especially at higher vehicle speeds (e.g. on highways), the reaction time of a safety driver is a pitfall. In this paper we analyze the situation, and propose a detection of challenging and limiting critical driving maneuvers, by using well known relations from vehicle dynamics. On the basis of this approach, we present the implementation into our autonomous driving demonstrator and show how to relax the response time requirements of the safety driver. Since highest safety requirements need to be met, the described methodology is implemented into a dependable embedded system. For our purposes an AURIX™ microprocessor with dedicated safety modules was chosen. Both, the hardware setup as well as the software implementation is discussed. Furthermore, the additional application of the proposed Safety-Gateway, to train safety drivers is reported too."
9127876,Controllability Analysis and Optimal Control of Mixed Traffic Flow With Human-Driven and Autonomous Vehicles,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have a great potential to improve traffic efficiency in mixed traffic systems, which has been demonstrated by multiple numerical simulations and field experiments. However, some fundamental properties of mixed traffic flow, including controllability and stabilizability, have not been well understood. This paper analyzes the controllability of mixed traffic systems and designs a system-level optimal control strategy. Using the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) criterion, we prove for the first time that a ring-road mixed traffic system with one CAV and multiple heterogeneous human-driven vehicles is not completely controllable, but is stabilizable under a very mild condition. Then, we formulate the design of a system-level control strategy for the CAV as a structured optimal control problem, where the CAV’s communication ability is explicitly considered. Finally, we derive an upper bound for reachable traffic velocity via controlling the CAV. Extensive numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of our analytical results and the proposed control strategy. Our results validate the possibility of utilizing CAVs as mobile actuators to smooth traffic flow actively."

9408233,Energy-Saving Optimization and Control of Autonomous Electric Vehicles With Considering Multiconstraints,"The energy utilization efficiency of autonomous electric vehicles is seriously affected by the longitudinal motion control performance. However, the longitudinal motion control is constrained by the driving scene. This article proposes an energy-saving optimization and control (ESOC) method to improve the energy utilization efficiency of autonomous electric vehicles. In ESOC, the constraints from the driving scene are thoroughly considered, and the autonomous driving scene constraints are mapped to the vehicle dynamics and control domain. On this basis, the efficiency self-searching method and the multiconstraint energy-saving control strategy are designed. The main ideology of the proposed ESOC is that the energy utilization efficiency of an autonomous electric vehicle can be improved by optimizing and controlling the operation point distribution of the powertrain efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that the operation point distribution of the autonomous electric vehicle's powertrain efficiency can be well optimized by the proposed ESOC, and the energy consumption results indicate that the proposed ESOC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
9557794,Vulnerability-Oriented Fuzz Testing for Connected Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"In an era of connectivity and automation, the vehicle industry is adopting numerous technologies to transform driver-centric vehicles into intelligent mechanical devices driven by software components. Software integration and network connectivity inherit numerous security issues that open the door for malicious attacks. Software security testing is a scalable and practical approach to identify systems’ weaknesses and vulnerabilities at an early stage and throughout their life-cycle. Security specialists recommend fuzz testing to identify vulnerabilities within vehicle software systems. Nevertheless, the randomness and blindness of fuzzing hinder it from becoming a reliable security tool. This article presents a vulnerability-oriented fuzz (VulFuzz) testing framework that utilizes security vulnerability metrics designed particularly for connected and autonomous vehicles to direct and prioritize the fuzz testing toward the most vulnerable components. While most gray-box fuzzing techniques aim solely to expand code coverage, the proposed approach assigns weights to ensure a thorough examination of the most vulnerable components. Moreover, we employ an input structure-aware mutation technique that can bypass vehicle software systems’ input formats to boost test performance and avoid dropped test cases. Such a testing technique will contribute to the quality assurance of vehicle software engineering. We implemented the proposed approach on OpenPilot, a driver assistance system, and compared our results to American fuzzy lop (AFL) and an unguided mutation-based fuzzer. Within 16.8 h, VulFuzz exposed 335 crashes, 41 times more than AFL and two times more than an unguided mutation-based fuzzer. VulFuzz is explicitly efficient for automotive systems, reaching the same code coverage as AFL but with more exposed crashes and fewer dropped messages."

In this paper, we use ResNet to forecast AVs' trajectories, which is able to capture the features of different dimensions to achieve better predictions. By feeding the raw input picture, the model output s three trajectories and their confidence levels respectively, which means each trajectory has its own confidence level. Experimental results show that our method performs better than other deep learning methods. The loss function value of ResNet-34 model is lower than that of VGG-16 model and VGG-19 model."

Connected vehicles (CV) and automated vehicles (AV) are among the most heavily researched and promising automotive technologies to reduce road accidents and improve road efficiency. However, both AV and CV technologies have inherent shortcomings, for example, line of sight sensing limitation of AV sensors and the dependency of high penetration rate for CVs. In this paper we present a cooperative connected intelligent vehicles (CAV) framework. It is motivated by the observation that vehicles are increasingly intelligent with various levels of autonomous functionalities. The vehicles intelligence is boosted by more sensing and computing resources. These sensor and computing resources of CAV vehicles and the transport infrastructure could be shared and exploited. With resource sharing and cooperation CAVs can have comprehensive perception of driving environments, and novel cooperative applications can be developed to improve road safety and efficiency (RSE). The key feature of the cooperative CAV system is the cooperation within and across the key players in the road transport systems and across system layers. For example, the various levels of cooperation include cooperative sensing, cooperative RSE applications and cooperation among the vehicles and among the vehicles and infrastructure. We will present the potentials that could be brought by cooperative CAV, the roadmap for research and development, the preliminary research results and open issues."

On the one hand, it analyzes and determines the motivations that cause the driving state to change for decision-making and planning. On the other hand, on the basis of the lateral trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles, the longitudinal trajectory propensity prediction of different drivers is added to construct a risk assessment model that can reflect risk of the future time domain. Based on this, the motivation-based decision method is mapped into the risk assessment model, and a cost function is established to decouple the path and speed, so that the geometry and speed can be flexibly adjusted according to environmental risks. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively make driving behavior decisions and plan the trajectory in real time according to the current environment, which can improve the computational efficiency of the decision-making process and guarantee the safety at the same time."
9034121,"Virtual Target-Based Overtaking Decision, Motion Planning, and Control of Autonomous Vehicles","This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a virtual target-based overtaking decision, motion planning, and control algorithm for autonomous vehicles. Both driver acceptance and safety, when surrounded by other vehicles, must be considered during autonomous overtaking. These are considered through safe distance based on human driving behavior. Since all vehicles cannot be equipped with a vehicle to vehicle communications at present, autonomous vehicles should perceive the surrounding environment based on local sensors. In this paper, virtual targets are devised to cope with the limitation of cognitive range. A probabilistic prediction is adopted to enhance safety, given the potential behavior of surrounding vehicles. Then, decision-making and motion planning has been designed based on the probabilistic prediction-based safe distance, which could achieve safety performance without a heavy computational burden. The algorithm has considered the decision rules that drivers use when overtaking. For this purpose, concepts of target space, demand, and possibility for lane change are devised. In this paper, three driving modes are developed for active overtaking. The desired driving mode is decided for safe and efficient overtaking. To obtain desired states and constraints, intuitive motion planning is conducted. A stochastic model predictive control has been adopted to determine vehicle control inputs. The proposed autonomous overtaking algorithm has been evaluated through simulation, which reveals the effectiveness of virtual targets. Also, the proposed algorithm has been successfully implemented on an autonomous vehicle and evaluated via real-world driving tests. Safe and comfortable overtaking driving has been demonstrated using a test vehicle."
8669823,Dynamic Modeling of Passively Draining Structures for Aerial–Aquatic Unmanned Vehicles,"In the design of hybrid unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles, buoyancy management and weight are two major factors. Large wing volumes used by unmanned air vehicles to fly efficiently drive vehicle buoyancy up, preventing them from submerging. Heavy active buoyancy control systems can overcome this, but cost weight, energy, and time to transition between underwater operation and flight. An alternative design, consisting of a passively flooding and draining wing, is presented in this paper. Relevant dynamic parameters for a full vehicle dynamic model are identified. A dynamic model of a draining structure is developed and verified experimentally on both a simple cylinder and a full wing structure. With proper tuning, the model captures the salient dynamic behavior of passive draining during vehicle egress. A prototype unmanned aerial and underwater vehicle was built, flown, and used to collect flight test data. The model is used to accurately predict the takeoff performance of the vehicle.

9072289,Traffic Flow on a Ring With a Single Autonomous Vehicle: An Interconnected Stability Perspective,"In recent years, field experiments have been performed on ring roadways with human-driven vehicles or with a mix of human-driven and autonomous vehicles. While these experiments demonstrate the potential for controlling traffic flows by a small number of autonomous vehicles, the theoretical framework about such a possibility is to a large extent incomplete. Indeed, most work on mixed traffic focused on classical asymptotical stability notions, neglecting that human drivers are prone to the interconnected instability known in the literature as string instability. This work aims to enhance the existing theories to meet the questions raised by the field experiments. It starts from the observation that the standard notion of string stability on a ring roadway is too demanding for a mixed traffic scenario: therefore, a new interconnected stability definition, named weak ring stability, is proposed. This new interconnected stability notion, in combination with classical stability, is able to explain phenomena observed in field experiments and to highlight possibilities and limitations of traffic control via sparse autonomous vehicle. Furthermore, it allows designing AV controllers with improved string stability specifications, at the price of reducing the sparsity of the autonomous vehicles."

9729796,Autonomous Vehicle Cut-In Algorithm for Lane-Merging Scenarios via Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning Nested Within Finite-State Machine,"Lane-merging scenarios pose highly challenging problems for autonomous vehicles due to conflicts of interest between the human-driven and cutting-in autonomous vehicles. Such conflicts become severe when traffic increases, and cut-in algorithms suffer from a steep trade-off between safety and cut-in performance. In this study, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based cut-in policy network nested within a finite state machine (FSM)--which is a high-level decision maker, is proposed to achieve high cut-in performance without sacrificing safety. This FSM-RL hybrid approach is proposed to obtain 1) a strategic and adjustable algorithm, 2) optimal safety and cut-in performance, and 3) robust and consistent performance. In the high-level decision making algorithm, the FSM provides a framework for four cut-in phases (ready for safe gap selection, gap approach, negotiation, and lane-change execution) and handles the transitions between these phases by calculating the collision risks associated with target vehicles. For the lane-change phase, a policy-based deep-RL approach with a soft actor-critic network is employed to get optimal cut-in performance. The results of simulations show that the proposed FSM-RL cut-in algorithm consistently achieves a high cut-in success rate without sacrificing safety. In particular, as the traffic increases, the cut-in success rate and safety are significantly improved over existing optimized rule-based cut-in algorithms and end-to-end RL algorithm."
9177615,Set-Invariance Based Fuzzy Output Tracking Control for Vehicle Autonomous Driving under Uncertain Lateral Forces and Steering Constraints,"This paper presents a new control method for path tracking of autonomous vehicles. Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control is used to handle the time-varying vehicle speed and the uncertain tire-road forces involved in the nonlinear vehicle dynamics. To avoid using costly vehicle sensors while keeping a simple control structure, a new fuzzy static output feedback (SOF) scheme is proposed. Moreover, robust set-invariance is exploited to take into account the physical limitations on the steering input and the vehicle state in the control design for safety and comfort improvement. Based on Lyapunov stability arguments, a non-parallel distributed compensation SOF controller is designed for autonomous driving with reduced conservatism. The control design is reformulated as an optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities, easily solved with available numerical solvers. The path tracking performance of the proposed fuzzy controller is evaluated via dynamic driving tests conducted with high-fidelity CarSim/Simulink co-simulations."

9267937,Multi-AUV Coverage with Functional Constraints and Currents,"Many underwater survey applications such as bathymetry archaeological, mine-counter-measure surveys, etc., can be efficiently performed using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In all the mentioned survey applications, a region of interest needs to be covered using some sensors. Low cost AUVs have shown promise to perform these applications quickly and with relatively low mission cost. However, these AUVs are affected by the currents present in the region. Currents can help (resp. hinder) in propelling the AUV saving (resp. expending) time and energy and also can hinder with increased endurance cost. During such a process, the results mission time may be reduced significantly affecting the complete mission. If this issue is discovered after deployment then the cost of the mission increases. Additionally, certain areas may need a AUV with specific sensor to visit. For example, AUVs using 3D imaging sonar to map a particular area of interest (archaeology). We term such a constrain as a functional constraint. Further, the total mission time can be reduced significantly by introducing multiple AUVs. Therefore, there is a need develop mission path planners that take current information into account and the functional constraints for multi-AUV deployment. In this paper, we determine paths taking functional constraints (FC) and current information into account. We formulate the problem as a linear program, however, finding routes with the vehicle-target constraints is an NP-Hard problem. Due to the computational complexity we use insertion heuristic methods to determine a fast and simple paths. We also allow for the possibility of multi-depots (base stations for deploy-ments/retrieval) in the problem formulation. The developed insertion heuristics has two stages. The first stage involves determining a feasible solution and in the second stage we perform an iterative search for load balancing which implicitly minimizes the maximum route for the given set of vehicles.

9316667,Combined Trajectory Planning and Tracking for Autonomous Vehicle Considering Driving Styles,"Autonomous driving is one of the promising technologies to tackle traffic accident and congestion problems nowadays. Even though an autonomous vehicle is operated without humans, it is necessary to reflect the driving characteristics of a human driver. This can increase user acceptance to autonomous driving system, which in turn will improve driving safety because of human occupants’ trust in it. In this paper, a combined trajectory planning and tracking algorithm is proposed for the vehicle control. Firstly, traffic environments and driving styles are modeled with the Artificial Potential Field (APF) approach. Secondly, those APF values are integrated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) design process, which can optimize the trajectories and control outputs. In this way, we add people’s driving habits and styles into the controller, so that the controlled vehicle can move under the effects of the traffic environments and human’s driving styles. At last, autonomous driving, which reflects two types of human drivers’ driving styles (a cautious driving style and an aggressive one), is tested by the simulation experiments in two scenarios (car-following and lane-changing). Furthermore, the result demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can reflect driving styles. Accordingly, this novel controller can be utilized in the autonomous vehicle control field."

While the vehicle self-driving technology has been growing rapidly, the validation for autonomous vehicle in terms of driving model, human factor model and traffic model is still maturing. Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI).

9687569,An Integrated Framework on Autonomous-EV Charging and Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) Management System,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) transform traditional commuting by decreasing congestion, improving road safety, and naturally integrate better with electric controls for flexible implementation of autonomous driving technologies. Indeed, electric-powered AVs or autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) are benefiting each other in many aspects. While autonomy brings great efficiency in driving as well as battery use, EVs require less maintenance and drastically cut fuel costs. With AVs, a pivotal concern is within the realm of long-range Autonomous Valet Parking (LAVP), such as diverse customer demands on parking (or drop-off / pick-up) for various journey planning. On the other hand, electric-powered AVs are typically with limited cruising range, and locating convenient charging services are also among the major impediments. As of yet, recent studies have started to investigate EV charging and LAVP in isolation as they rarely consider a joint optimization on user trip and energy refueling. Rather, we target in this work the integration of vehicle charging with autonomy in the sense of a systemic approach. Specifically, we propose an integrated AEV charging and LAVP management scheme, to resolve critical decision-making on convenient charging and parking management upon customer requirements during their journeys. The proposed scheme jointly considers charging reservations as well as parking duration at car parks (CPs), aiming to enable accurate predictions on future charging (and parking) states at CPs. Results show the advantage of our proposal over benchmarks, in terms of enhanced customer experiences in traveling period, as well as charging performances at both AEV and CP sides. Particularly, effective load balancing can be achieved across the network regarding the amount of charged as well as parked vehicles."

Comprehensively considering control system accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency in the rolling optimization of Model Predictive Control (MPC), Adaptive Model Predictive Control for Uncertain model (UM-AMPC) algorithm is proposed to predict control variables for the next sampling time and alleviate the target angle discontinuity. This is achieved by operating target angle signal and augmented state variables, which are received by the lower nodes during the period from the current sampling time to network delay upper bound.

9243122,Impact of the Charging Demand of Electric Vehicles on Distribution Grids: a Comparison Between Autonomous and Non-Autonomous Driving,"Charging many electric vehicles (EVs) might cause violations of cable ampacities, statutory voltage limits, and substation transformer ratings in power distribution grids. Besides affecting mobility patterns, autonomous driving will open new perspectives in terms of interactions with the power grid. This paper explores the potential of autonomous EVs of reducing grid congestions thanks to the possibility of reaching the most suitable recharging locations autonomously. We first develop an algorithm for the coordinated charging of non-autonomous EVs accounting for grid constraints. We then augment its formulation by modeling the charging locations as decision variables of the problem, adopting an efficient linear mixed-integer program based on a linearized grid model and McCormick (exact) relaxations to handle some bi-linear terms appearing in the formulation. Considering the CIGRE' benchmark system for LV residential grids, we compare non-autonomous versus autonomous EVs and show that the additional degree of freedom coming from autonomous driving achieves reducing grid congestions."
8768322,Autonomous Tracking and Sampling of the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum Layer in an Open-Ocean Eddy by a Long-Range Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"Phytoplankton communities residing in the open ocean, the largest habitat on Earth, play a key role in global primary production. Through their influence on nutrient supply to the euphotic zone, open-ocean eddies impact the magnitude of primary production and its spatial and temporal distributions. It is important to gain a deeper understanding of the microbial ecology of marine ecosystems under the influence of eddy physics with the aid of advanced technologies. In March and April 2018, we deployed autonomous underwater and surface vehicles in a cyclonic eddy in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre to investigate the variability of the microbial community in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. One long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV) carrying a third-generation Environmental Sample Processor (3G-ESP) autonomously tracked and sampled the DCM layer for four days without surfacing. The sampling LRAUV's vertical position in the DCM layer was maintained by locking onto the isotherm corresponding to the chlorophyll peak. The vehicle ran on tight circles while drifting with the eddy current. This mode of operation enabled a quasi-Lagrangian time series focused on sampling the temporal variation of the DCM population. A companion LRAUV surveyed a cylindrical volume around the sampling LRAUV to monitor spatial and temporal variation in contextual water column properties. The simultaneous sampling and mapping enabled observation of DCM microbial community in its natural frame of reference."
9190735,CDVA/VCM: Language for Intelligent and Autonomous Vehicles,"Intelligent transportation is a complex system that involves the interaction of connected technologies, including Smart Sensors, Intelligent and Autonomous Vehicles, High Precision Maps, and 5G. The coordination of all these machines mandates a common language that serves as a protocol for intelligent machines to communicate. International standards serves as the global protocol to satisfy industry needs at the product level. MPEG-CDVA is the official ISO standard for search and retrieval applications by providing Compact Descriptors for Video Analysis (CDVA). It is robust and enables efficient implementations on embedded systems. CDVA is the first generation language for images/videos. MPEG-VCM is developing advanced features beyond CDVA to the new generation as Video Coding for Machines (VCM). With the wide availability of low-power AI chips, CDVA and VCM are ready to deploy and serve as the language for intelligent and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the SuperCDVA and Closed Captioning CDVA algorithms for intelligent and autonomous vehicles.

In order for intelligent and autonomous vehicles to understand events on the road, the CDVA vectors are organized into an image to represent the story of the video."
8444685,A Workload Balanced Algorithm for Task Assignment and Path Planning of Inhomogeneous Autonomous Underwater Vehicle System,"Task assignment is an important research topic in multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cooperative working system. However, many studies concentrate on minimizing total distance of AUVs serving targets at different locations, and mostly do not pay attention to workload balance among inhomogeneous AUVs. What is more, most of them do not think of the effect of ocean current while distributing tasks. To solve these problems, a novel dual competition strategy based on self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is put forward. An AUV makes use of surplus sailing distance to a target when it competes with others for engaging the target. In order to fulfill a balanced task assignment among AUVs, a task balance coefficient is also proposed. Meanwhile, a hybrid path planning approach is applied to guide AUVs to reach their targets safely. The good performance of the proposed algorithm for distributing tasks among AUVs is demonstrated through simulation studies. From the comparison study of SOM algorithm, Hungarian algorithm, k-means algorithm, and the proposed dual competition strategy, it can be found that the task assignment with the proposed strategy is more rational and fair."
9703673,Risk Adversarial Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Charging,"In this paper, the design of a rational decision support system (RDSS) for a connected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied. In the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an EV charging facility for human-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). The charging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more energy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling policy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging request to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and AVs. To tackle this, we formulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the charging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus, we devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational behavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial multi-agent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS problem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA) for informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the role of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by coping advice from RAA. Experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS affords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in the EVSE’s active charging time and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as compared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines."

The most common solution for recharging their batteries still implies removing them from the water, which is exceptionally costly. The use of Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) technologies allows to mitigate the associated costs and to extend the vehicles' operation time. In consequence, a prototype has been developed, whose objective is to integrate commercially available IPT technologies, while allowing the employment by most of the AUVs. The prototype is a funnel structure and its counterpart aimed to be fixed to a docking station and the AUV respectively. When coupled, it enables the batteries to recharge by electromagnetic induction. Energy transmission has been tested, resulting in encouraging results. This particular solution achieved over 90% efficiency during underwater experiments. The next objective will be to develop a commercial version of the prototype, that allows a direct, practical and effective use of wireless charging technologies within this particular scenario."

8813899,SafeVRU: A Research Platform for the Interaction of Self-Driving Vehicles with Vulnerable Road Users,"This paper presents our research platform Safe VRU for the interaction of self-driving vehicles with Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs, i.e., pedestrians and cyclists). The paper details the design (implemented with a modular structure within ROS) of the full stack of vehicle localization, environment perception, motion planning, and control, with emphasis on the environment perception and planning modules. The environment perception detects the VRUs using a stereo camera and predicts their paths with Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), which can account for switching dynamics. The motion planner is based on model predictive contouring control (MPCC) and takes into account vehicle dynamics, control objectives (e.g., desired speed), and perceived environment (i.e., the predicted VRU paths with behavioral uncertainties) over a certain time horizon. We present simulation and real-world results to illustrate the ability of our vehicle to plan and execute collision-free trajectories in the presence of VRUs."

9031945,A Review on Vision Based Control of Autonomous Vehicles Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques,"In recent years, there has been substantial research scope for Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles (AUGV) which is a burning topic for researchers and scientists. The concept of AUGV had been introduced way back to the 1920s and at that time it was mainly applied in war fronts, such as in Teletanks, Infantry Tanks, Goliath tracked mine etc. during 2nd world war. After the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, AUGV has been used in different fields of applications, such as in transport systems, control systems, space science, manufacturing, etc. All the works demonstrated in these applications were mainly on vision-based obstacle avoidance for autonomous ground vehicles. In some of the work, LIDAR based camera embedded at the top of the vehicle for acquiring images which are directly connected to the GPS monitoring system has been implemented.

Moreover, hybridization of variants of neural networks, probabilistic based model, heuristic optimization techniques has been effectively implemented in AUGV. The basic motto of these nature-inspired techniques is to complete the tasks, such as optimizing the path, optimizing the system parameters and controller, etc., required for both static as well as dynamic obstacles avoidance."
9719995,Skills to Drive: Successor Features for Autonomous Highway Pilot,"Reinforcement learning applications are spreading among different domains, including autonomous vehicle control. The diverse situations that can happen during, for instance, at a highway commute are infinite, and with labeled data, the perfect coverage of all use-cases sounds ambitious. However, with the complex tasks and complicated scenarios faced during an autonomous vehicle system design, the credit assignment problem arises. How to construct appropriate objectives for the artificial intelligence to learn and the preferences between the different goals also matter of the designer's choice. This work attempts to tackle the problem by utilizing successor features and providing a possible decomposition of the reward functions, guiding the agent's actions. This method makes the training easier for the agent and enables immediate, profound performance on new combined tasks. Furthermore, with the optimal composition, the desired behavior can be fine-tuned, and as an auxiliary gain, the decomposition empowers different driving styles and makes driving preferences rapidly changeable. We introduce the adaptation of FastRL algorithm to autonomous vehicle domain, meanwhile developing a stabilizing way of using Successor Features, namely DoubleFastRL. We compare our solution for a highway driving scenario with basic agents such as Q-learning having multi-objective training."

However Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not available under actual combat conditions, this paper proposes a high precision autonomous navigation algorithm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on MEMS sensor. To reduce the effects of zero bias of inertial sensor on navigation states, a zero bias compensation algorithm is proposed in this paper, estimating and compensating zero bias by standing still for a period of time before the unmanned vehicle moves. In the flight process, a navigation model based on constrained attack angle and sideslip angle is established, and airspeed is used to correct the state errors of INS. The results of vehicle experiments and flight experiments show that the autonomous navigation algorithm proposed in this paper has high precision and can meet the actual task requirements in a limited time."
8759985,Fuzzy Static Output Feedback Control for Path Following of Autonomous Vehicles With Transient Performance Improvements,"This paper provides a new solution for path following control of autonomous ground vehicles. H 2 control problem is considered to attenuate the effect of the road curvature disturbance. To this end, we formulate a standard model from the road-vehicle dynamics, the a priori knowledge on the road curvature, and the path following specifications. This standard model is then represented in a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy form to deal with the time-varying nature of the vehicle speed. Based on a static output feedback scheme, the proposed method allows avoiding expensive vehicle sensors while keeping the simplest control structure for real-time implementation. The concept of V-stability is exploited using Lyapunov stability arguments to improve the transient behaviors of the closed-loop vehicle system. In particular, the physical upper and lower bounds of the vehicle acceleration are explicitly considered in the design procedure via a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function to reduce drastically the design conservatism. The proposed H 2 design conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with a single line search parameter. The effectiveness of the new path following control method is clearly demonstrated with both theoretical illustrations and hardware experiments under realworld driving situations."

The optimum velocity profile is sought for a predefined road path from a specific starting point to a final one within specific and given boundaries and constrains in order to minimise the motion sickness without compromising the journey time. For the representation of the motion sickness as a cost function to our optimal control problem, the illness rating is used. The influence of road width flexibility on illness rating and for a set of fixed journey times are investigated. According to the results, the road with flexible lateral manoeuvrability is found to provide lower sickness compared to the fixed road path. Moreover, the correlation between sickness and journey time can be represented as a Pareto front."

This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control based method to generate a safe and feasible trajectory for the ego vehicle to perform various lateral maneuvers and to produce optimized control inputs to guide the ego vehicle through a mixed traffic environment with both human drivers and autonomous vehicle. A novel reference speed generation function is proposed to automatically adjust the position of the ego vehicle before the initiation of any lateral maneuvers. After a proper gap is selected, the lateral maneuver initiation function with an add-on threshold function is introduced to ensure the safety of the maneuver and to enable the ego vehicle to automatically start or stop the lateral maneuver. A nonlinear and high fidelity tire model is utilized in the simulation to validate the algorithm and the simulation results show that various maneuvers can be successfully achieved without re-tuning the weights or changing the parameters of the controller."

Another possible solution is deep reinforcement learning, but such a method requires that the agent interacts with its surroundings in a simulated environment. In this paper we introduce GridSim, which is an autonomous driving simulator engine running a car-like robot architecture to generate occupancy grids from simulated sensors. We use GridSim to study the performance of two deep learning approaches, deep reinforcement learning and driving behavioral learning through genetic algorithms.

The algorithms are evaluated on simulated highways, curved roads and innercity scenarios, all including different driving limitations."
9551158,State-Of-The-Art And Directions For The Conceptual Design Of Safety-Critical Unmanned And Autonomous Aerial Vehicles,"Unmanned and Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAV/AAV) must be safe and reliable to prevent catastrophic accidents in population-dense areas. The study reveals the absence of a comprehensive UAV/AAV design for reliability approach in the open literature; in particular, there is no conceptual design methodology including safety and reliability considerations in the sizing. This finding leads to investigating the relevance of pursuing this research direction and identifying the challenges to address. For this matter, a straightforward approach combining sizing, systematic redundancy, controllability, and reliability assessments compares a conventional to a redundant design in a case study. The reliability analysis confirms that the redundant design is fault-tolerant and potentially highly reliable. However, the total mass almost doubles due to the lack of sizing and redundancy optimization. Plus, there is a high risk of under-sizing due to the limitations of a straightforward approach. This result emphasizes the need to develop a new conceptual design methodology based on sizing, including safety and reliability considerations. The paper concludes with research directions towards this goal. Thus, optimized redundant designs will contribute to the emergence of UAV/AAV for safety-critical applications in the near future."
9402306,Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Vehicles: A Case Study on Simulink,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will revolutionize the way people travel by car. However, in order to deploy autonomous vehicles, effective testing techniques are required. The driving quality of an AV should definitely be considered when testing such systems. However, as in other complex systems, determining the outcome of a test in the driving quality on an AV can be extremely complex. To solve this issue, in this paper we explore the application of Quality-of-Service (QoS) aware metamorphic testing to test AVs modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, one of the predominant modeling tools in the market. We first defined a set of QoS measures applied to AVs by considering as input a recent study. With them, we define metamorphic relations. Lastly we assess the approach in an AV modeled in Simulink by using mutation testing. The results suggests that our approach is effective at detecting faults."

8911227,Trajectory Optimization and Situational Analysis Framework for Autonomous Overtaking With Visibility Maximization,"In this article we present a trajectory generation method for autonomous overtaking of unexpected obstacles in a dynamic urban environment. In these settings, blind spots can arise from perception limitations. For example when overtaking unexpected objects on the vehicle's ego lane on a two-way street. In this case, a human driver would first make sure that the opposite lane is free and that there is enough room to successfully execute the maneuver, and then it would cut into the opposite lane in order to execute the maneuver successfully. We consider the practical problem of autonomous overtaking when the coverage of the perception system is impaired due to occlusion. Safe trajectories are generated by solving, in real-time, a non-linear constrained optimization, formulated as a receding horizon planner that maximizes the ego vehicle's visibility. The planner is complemented by a high-level behavior planner, which takes into account the occupancy of other traffic participants, the information from the vehicle's perception system, and the risk associated with the overtaking maneuver, to determine when the overtake maneuver should happen. The approach is validated in simulation and in experiments in real world traffic."
9712397,Learning Configurations of Operating Environment of Autonomous Vehicles to Maximize their Collisions,"Autonomous vehicles must operate safely in their dynamic and continuously-changing environment. However, the operating environment of an autonomous vehicle is complicated and full of various types of uncertainties. Additionally, the operating environment has many configurations, including static and dynamic obstacles with which an autonomous vehicle must avoid collisions. Through various approaches targeting on environment configuration for autonomous vehicles have shown promising results, their effectiveness in dealing with a continuous-changing environment is limited. Thus, it is essential to learn realistic environment configurations ofcontinuously-changing environment, under which an autonomous vehicle should be tested regarding its ability to avoid collisions. Featured with agents dynamically interacting with the environment, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential in dealing with complicated problems requiring adapting to the environment. To this end, we present an RL-based environment configuration learning approach, i.e., DeepCollision, which intelligently learns environment configurations that lead an autonomous vehicle to crash.DeepCollision employs Deep Q-Learning as the RL solution, and selects collision probability, as the safety measure, to construct the reward function. We trained four DeepCollision models and conducted an experiment to compare them with two baselines, i.e., random and greedy. Results show that DeepCollision demonstrated significantly better effectiveness in generating collisions compared with the baselines. We also provide recommendations on configuring DeepCollision with the most suitable time interval based on different road structures."
9700770,A Survey on Imitation Learning Techniques for End-to-End Autonomous Vehicles,"The state-of-the-art decision and planning approaches for autonomous vehicles have moved away from manually designed systems, instead focusing on the utilisation of large-scale datasets of expert demonstration via Imitation Learning (IL). In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of IL approaches, primarily for the paradigm of end-to-end based systems in autonomous vehicles. We classify the literature into three distinct categories: 1) Behavioural Cloning (BC), 2) Direct Policy Learning (DPL) and 3) Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For each of these categories, the current state-of-the-art literature is comprehensively reviewed and summarised, with future directions of research identified to facilitate the development of imitation learning based systems for end-to-end autonomous vehicles.

8671749,From the Racetrack to the Road: Real-Time Trajectory Replanning for Autonomous Driving,"In emergency situations, autonomous vehicles will be forced to operate at their friction limits in order to avoid collisions. In these scenarios, coordinating the planning of the vehicle's path and speed gives the vehicle the best chance of avoiding an obstacle. Fast reaction time is also important in an emergency, but approaches to the trajectory planning problem based on nonlinear optimization are computationally expensive. This paper presents a new scheme that simultaneously modifies the desired path and speed profile for a vehicle in response to the appearance of an obstacle, significant tracking error, or other environmental change. By formulating the trajectory optimization problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program, solution times of less than 20 ms are possible even with a 10-s planning horizon. A simplified point mass model is used to describe the vehicle's motion, but the incorporation of longitudinal weight transfer and road topography means that the vehicle's acceleration limits are modeled more accurately than in comparable approaches. Experimental data from an autonomous vehicle in two scenarios demonstrate how the trajectory planner enables the vehicle to avoid an obstacle even when the obstacle appears suddenly and the vehicle is already operating near the friction limits."

9652038,In-Vehicle CAN Bus Tampering Attacks Detection for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using an Improved Isolation Forest Method,"The development and applications of mobile communication technologies in intelligent autonomous transportation systems have led to an extraordinary rise in the mount of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Ensuring the security of in-vehicle communication data is the basis for the safety of cooperative transportation systems. An in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is an important issue in in-vehicle security, and some hackers have mastered remote vehicle control methods through the CAN bus network. This paper proposes an improved isolation forest method with data mass (MS-iForest) for data tampering attack detection, in which we use data mass instead of the number of divisions and give an anomaly score ranking to quantify the degree of anomalies. This method is promising to be used as part of the intrusion detection system, like a security component in the onboard gateway, which can effectively avoid the data tampering attacks. We compare the proposed method with other anomaly detection schemes based on the data collected from an in-vehicle simulated dataset and two standard datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method performs better than the other anomaly detection schemes in terms of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC)."
9020575,Abstract Simulation Scenario Generation for Autonomous Vehicle Verification,"Autonomous vehicle technology has the potential to have a significant impact on the transportation system and urban life. However, the autonomous vehicles must be proven to be at least as safe as human-driven vehicles before they are accepted as a new mode of transportation. Current methods of autonomous vehicle verification such as shadow driving or annotated images based testing are costly, slow and resource intensive. Hence, modeling and simulation is an indispensable asset to achieve verification goals for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose an abstract simulation scenario generation framework for autonomous vehicle verification. The scenes and the related assertions are defined by a matrixbased semantic language and translated into test scenarios in simulation. The framework allows the design of all possible road topologies and the validation of generated scenarios. The scenarios generated in the framework form a ground truth for possible extended tests of rare conditions in other platforms."
9140316,Generalized Optimal Control for Autonomous Mine Countermeasures Missions,"This article presents a computational framework for planning mine countermeasures (MCM) search missions by autonomous vehicles. It employs generalized optimal control (GenOC), a model-based trajectory optimization approach, to maximize the expected search performance of vehicle-sensor pairs in different minehunting scenarios. We describe each element of the proposed framework and adapt it to solve real-world MCM motion planning problems. A key contribution of this article develops sensor models that are more tunable than conventional ones based on lateral range curves. The proposed models incorporate engineering parameters and 3-D geometry to compute mine detection probability as a function of sonar design and search vehicle trajectories. Specific examples for various forward-looking and sidescan sonar systems deployed by unmanned vehicles are included. Objective computations utilize these sonar detection models during optimization to minimize the risk that candidate search trajectories fail to detect mines in an area of interest. Simulation results highlight the flexibility of our proposed GenOC framework and confirm that optimal trajectories outperform conventional search patterns under time or resource constraints. We conclude by identifying some of the practical considerations of this approach, and suggest ways that numerical analysis of GenOC solutions can be used for MCM mission planning and decision aid development."
9341676,PaintPath: Defining Path Directionality in Maps for Autonomous Ground Vehicles,"Directionality in path planning is essential for efficient autonomous navigation in a number of real-world environments. In many map-based navigation scenarios, the viable path from a given point A to point B is not the same as the viable path from B to A. We present a method that automatically incorporates preferred navigation directionality into a path planning costmap. This `preference' is represented by coloured paths in the costmap. The colourisation is obtained based on an analysis of the driving trajectory generated by the robot as it navigates through the environment. Hence, our method augments this driving trajectory by intelligently colouring it according to the orientation of the robot during the run. Creating an analogy between the vehicle orientation angle and the hue angle in the Hue-Saturation-Value colour space, the method uses the hue, saturation and value components to encode the direction, directionality and scalar cost, respectively, into a costmap image. We describe a costing function to be used by the A* algorithm to incorporate this information to plan direction-aware vehicle paths. Our experiments with LiDAR-based localisation and autonomous driving in real environments illustrate the applicability of the method."
8671765,Motion Planning of Autonomous Road Vehicles by Particle Filtering,"This paper describes a probabilistic method for realtime decision making and motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Our approach relies on the fact that driving on road networks implies apriori defined requirements that the motion planner should satisfy. Starting from an initial state of the vehicle, a map, the obstacles in the region of interest, and a goal region, we formulate the motion-planning problem as a nonlinear non-Gaussian estimation problem, which we solve using particle filtering. We assign probabilities to the generated trajectories according to their likelihood of obeying the driving requirements. Decision making and collision avoidance is naturally integrated in the approach. We develop a receding-horizon implementation and verify the method in simulated real road scenarios and in an experimental validation using a scaled mobile robot setup with car-like dynamics. The results show that the method generates dynamically feasible trajectories for a number of scenarios, such as collision avoidance, overtaking, and traffic-jam scenarios. In addition, the computation times and memory requirements indicate that the method is suitable for real-time implementation."

9623371,Exploring Behavioral Patterns of Lane Change Maneuvers for Human-Like Autonomous Driving,"Due to the growing interest in automated driving, a deep understanding on the characteristics of human driving behavior is critical for human-like autonomous vehicles. Among various driving behaviors, lane change is the most important one for vehicle lateral driving safety. This study proposes an unsupervised method to extract and discover the behavioral patterns of lane change maneuvers for the purpose of exploring the composed behavioral patterns during lane change. This method involves two phases: Firstly, the lane change sequences will be segmented into blocks using time-series segmentation algorithms. Three segmentation algorithms were utilized in this study. In the second phase, the segments will be clustered to find the corresponding behavioral pattern of each segment. Two extended latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models were adopted to cluster the segments. The combination of different segmentation and clustering algorithms were evaluated and compared by employing entropy and perplexity as the evaluation criteria. Collected lane change data from naturalistic driving were applied to examine its effectiveness. The results show that this method could effectively mine descriptive behavioral patterns from lane change data. This study provides a promising data mining solution to facilitating deep and comprehensive understanding on driver lane change behaviors, which will promote the development of human-like autonomous vehicles."
9034126,Inertial Navigation and Position Uncertainty During a Blind Safe Stop of an Autonomous Vehicle,"This work considers the problem of position and position-uncertainty estimation for atonomous vehicles during power black-out, where it cannot be assumed that any position data is accessible. To tackle this problem, the position estimation will instead be performed using power separated and independent measurement devices, including one inertial 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) measurement unit, four angular wheel speed sensors and one pinion angle sensor. The measurement unit's sensors are initially characterized in order to understand conceptual limitations of the inertial navigation and also to be used in a filtering process. Measurement models are then fused together with vehicle dynamics process models using the architecture of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Two different EKF filter concepts are developed to estimate the vehicle position during a safe stop; one simpler filter for smooth manoeuvres and a complex filter for aggressive manoeuvres. Both filter designs are tested and evaluated with data gathered from an experimental vehicle for selected manoeuvres of developed safe-stop scenarios. The experimental results from a set of use-case manoeuvres show a trend where the size of the position estimation errors significantly grows above an initial vehicle speed of 70 km/h. This paper contributes to develop vehicle dynamics models for the purpose of a blind safe stop."

9334392,R2-RRT*: Reliability-Based Robust Mission Planning of Off-Road Autonomous Ground Vehicle Under Uncertain Terrain Environment,"This article presents a reliable and robust rapidly exploring random tree (R2-RRT*) algorithm to tackle challenges in mission planning of off-road autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under uncertain terrain environment. Two types of mobility reliability metrics, namely state mobility reliability (SMR) and mission mobility reliability (MMR), are first defined to quantify the mobility reliability of an AGV and to incorporate mobility reliability into mission planning. SMR measures the probability that a vehicle can pass through a specific location on a map of interest, whereas MMR quantifies mobility reliability of a mission path with the consideration of dependence of soil properties and slope over space. Based on the defined SMR and MMR metrics, two reliability-based robust mission planning models are developed to identify optimal paths that have robust travel time and satisfy specific reliability requirements. Moreover, a reliability-based path smoothing algorithm is developed to address the suboptimality of R2-RRT*. Results of a case study demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms."
9304534,Predictive control of an autonomous vehicle to reduce traffic instability,"Traffic flow is known to be unstable at high densities, creating undesirable stop-and-go waves. Using real-time data and a long-range perception, an automated vehicle (AV) could detect perturbations early and adapt its trajectory to keep a nearly constant speed, making the overall flow smoother. This paper presents the following algorithm. Using a short-time prediction of its leader's trajectory, the AV computes a future trajectory that minimizes speed variations while keeping both a bounded acceleration and jerk. This controled trajectory is updated in real-time until the perturbation is passed and the vehicle goes back to its normal behavior. Simulation results using human drivers data for the downstream traffic show that the speed variations is reduced by more than 20 %."
9696360,Learning-based Path Planning and Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicles With Low-Cost Positioning,"Navigation algorithms for autonomous vehicles have become the subject of increasing interest, but most of them heavily rely on expensive high-precision positioning equipment, which hinders autonomous vehicles development. In this paper, we propose a path planning and control framework for autonomous vehicles with low-cost positioning. For the path planning layer, a potential field is constructed by the potential functions of road boundaries, obstacles, and reference waypoints. According to the potential field, a reinforcement learning agent is developed to generate a collision-free path for path tracking. For the control layer, a model predictive control based on vehicle dynamics is designed and a linear terminal constraint is considered. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively avoid static and dynamic obstacles. Moreover, compared with traditional methods, the proposed algorithm performs better when the positioning devices are imprecise. Furthermore, the real-time performance can meet the requirements of navigation."
8651668,An Advanced Coordination Protocol for Safer and more Efficient Lane Change for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"In this paper we will explore novel ways of utilizing inter-vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication technology to achieve a safe and efficient lane change manoeuvre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The need for such new protocols is due to the risk that every lane change manoeuvre brings to drivers and passengers lives in addition to its negative impact on congestion level and resulting air pollution, if not performed at the right time and using the appropriate speed. To avoid this risk, we design two new protocols, one is built upon and extends an existing protocol, and it aims to ensure safe and efficient lane change manoeuvre, while the second is an original lane change permission management solution inspired from mutual exclusion concept used in operating systems. This latter complements the former by exclusively granting lane change permissions in a way that avoids any risk of collision. Both protocols are being implemented using computer simulation and the results will be reported in a future work."
8723533,Functional Safety Verification for Autonomous UGVs—Methodology Presentation and Implementation on a Full-Scale System,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be on public roads in the near future, but some critical aspects of this reality are yet to be resolved. One of these aspects is the lack of a sufficient safety-performance-verification technique. The existing tools of functional-safety engineering do not provide a comprehensive solution for the verification of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For the verification of this type of algorithms, it has become widely accepted in the recent years that simulation tests should be used. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no detailed method for how these simulation tests should be performed has yet been suggested. To start tackling this gap, this paper presents a verification methodology based on the statistical testing of AVs' safety-related functionality in simulated scenarios. Also, presented here is a test-case implementation of the methodology on a full-scale autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). In this example, the functionality of safe autonomous off-road navigation is verified. It is shown that the statistical performance data that are gathered using simulation can be used to accurately predict the overall safety performance of UGVs in real life. Our intention is that this paper will provide a starting point for the further discussion on the exact way simulation tests shall be used for the safety verification of AVs."

9682543,Robust Path Planner for Autonomous Vehicles on Roads With Large Curvature,"Path planning in real road traffic refers to the navigation of an autonomous vehicle through an obstacle-filled environment. It is crucial for the comfort, safety, and efficiency of the autonomous driving experience. It is advantageous to plan paths in the reference line-based Frenet frames rather than the Cartesian frame to decouple the 2-dimensional vehicle motion into a lateral and a longitudinal component. Path planning has two important and implicit assumptions: 1) the curvature of the reference line has to be sufficiently small, and 2) the vehicle can not be too far from the reference line. Therefore, the generated paths should follow the reference line and always head in the correct direction. However, these assumptions do not always hold in real road traffic, and the generated paths may demonstrate some unintended behaviors. In this study, we discuss the necessary and sufficient requirements for the generated paths to follow the reference line and head in the correction direction, and then proposed an efficient solution for Frenet-based path planning when the assumptions are not satisfied. Experimental results on simulated driving scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method."
9320617,Semantic-Level Maneuver Sampling and Trajectory Planning for On-Road Autonomous Driving in Dynamic Scenarios,"Maneuver decision-making and trajectory planning play important roles in autonomous driving since a safe and flexible decision module is indispensable for navigation. Typical algorithms apply sampling methods to generate feasible trajectories. However, the fixed sampling distance and maneuver execution time in a sampling approach sacrifice the flexibility of algorithm. Moreover, since motion planning can be represented as a high-dimensional problem, it usually results in unnecessary samples that require additional resources to search the solution. Therefore, a semantic-level maneuver sampling and trajectory planning algorithm is proposed to solve the above problems. In the upper-level maneuver decision, the decision-making problem is formulated as a selection of the forward leading object. A semantic-level decision tree is built to sample long-term maneuver sequences, and the safety corridor of each maneuver sequence is calculated according to the surrounding environment. In the lower-level trajectory planning, the process is decoupled into longitudinal and lateral directions. First, a heuristic search method is proposed to generate longitudinal trajectory candidates for each maneuver sequence. Then, an exhaustive search algorithm is employed to synchronously generate the lateral trajectory within safety corridor. Among the generated trajectory candidates, the one with minimum cost will be chosen as the searching result. Furthermore, in order to improve the driving comfort, numerical optimization is adopted to refine the result by accounting for the constraints of kinematics and safety. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated through simulations of typical on-road dynamic scenarios, which help verify its performance with desirable computation efficiency of less than 32 ms."
9459688,Model Predictive Control of Soft Constraints for Autonomous Vehicle Major Lane-Changing Behavior With Time Variable Model,"Changing lane must not only ensure the safety of the vehicle itself, but also ensure the patency of the traffic flow of the original lane and the target lane. Therefore, successful lane-changing is a key technology for autonomous vehicle control. In order to avoid collisions and ensure the smooth flow of traffic, in this paper a vehicle dynamics state model with time variable is established as plant, and the lateral force of the steering wheel is further optimized through Model Predictive Control(MPC), and then the steering wheel angle is obtained to complete the lane-changing operation. The longitudinal and lateral logic controllers designed through soft constraints can better achieve the results of successful lane-changing and unsuccessful return to the original lane, and the lane-changing characteristics within the safety corridor are analyzed in several ways. The simulation analysis of lane-changing strategy at different vehicle velocities provides helpful guidance for the design of autonomous vehicle controllers."
9008449,Automated Taxi Booking Operations for Autonomous Vehicles,"In a conventional taxi booking system, all taxi operations are mostly done by a decision made by drivers which is hard to implement in unmanned vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce a taxi booking system which assists autonomous vehicles to pick up customers. The system can allocate an autonomous vehicle (AV) as well as plan service trips for a customer request. We use our own AV to serve a customer who uses a mobile application to make his taxi request. Apart from customer and AV, we build a server to monitor customers and AVs. It also supports inter-communication between a customer and an AV once AV decided to pick up a customer."
9277572,Spatio-Temporal Planning in Multi-Vehicle Scenarios for Autonomous Vehicle Using Support Vector Machines,"Efficient trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles in complex traffic scenarios is of interest both academically and in automotive industry. Time efficiency and safety are of key importance and here a two-step procedure is proposed. First, a convex optimization problem is solved, formulated as a support vector machine (SVM), in order to represent the surrounding environment of the ego vehicle and classify the search space as obstacles or obstacle free. This gives a reduced complexity search space and an A* algorithm is used in a state space lattice in 4 dimensions including position, heading angle and velocity for simultaneous path and velocity planning. Further, a heuristic derived from the SVM formulation is used in the A* search and a pruning technique is introduced to significantly improve search efficiency. Solutions from the proposed planner is compared to optimal solutions computed using optimal control techniques. Three traffic scenarios, a roundabout scenario and two complex takeover maneuvers, with multiple moving obstacles, are used to illustrate the general applicability of the proposed method."
9253253,3D Objects Detection in an Autonomous Car Driving Problem,"The autonomous driving problem is one of the most actual problems in both research and industrial fields. Autonomous vehicles are designed to optimize traffic congestion, minimize the number of traffic accidents, provide the ability to transport goods in dangerous conditions for humans, expand the possibilities of using cars for people with disabilities, etc. To successfully solve this problem, it is necessary to consider several subtasks, including localization and mapping, static and dynamic object detection, motion planning, and control. In this paper, we consider one of the tasks of an autonomous vehicle control system: 3D objects detection and localization. We investigate existing detection methods that use heterogeneous information from various sensors such as cameras, depth sensors, and LIDARs. To evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in an autonomous driving problem, we conduct the experimental studies on real and simulated data obtained using CARLA - an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research."
9204811,Robust Set-Invariance Based Fuzzy Output Tracking Control for Vehicle Autonomous Driving Under Uncertain Lateral Forces and Steering Constraints,"This paper is concerned with a new control method for path tracking of autonomous ground vehicles. We exploit the fuzzy model-based control framework to deal with the time-varying feature of the vehicle speed and the highly uncertain behaviors of the tire-road forces involved in the nonlinear vehicle dynamics. To avoid using costly vehicle sensors for feedback control while favoring the simplest control structure for real-time implementation, a new fuzzy static output feedback (SOF) scheme is proposed. In particular, though the robust set-invariance property and Lyapunov-based arguments, the physical constraints on the steering input saturation and the vehicle state can be taken into account in the control design to improve the driving safety and comfort. The theoretical development relies on the use of fuzzy Lyapunov functions and the non-parallel distributed compensation control concept to reduce the design conservatism. Exploiting some specific convexification techniques, the control design is reformulated as an optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities with a single line search, which are efficiently solved via semidefinite programming techniques. The proposed fuzzy path tracking controller is evaluated through various dynamic driving tests conducted with high-fidelity CarSim/Matlab co-simulations. Moreover, to emphasize the advantages of the new fuzzy SOF controller, a performance comparison with the CarSim driver model is also performed."
9045954,Trajectory Tracking Control Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicle Considering Cornering Characteristics,"Trajectory tracking control is a key technology in the research and development of autonomous vehicles. With the aim of addressing problems such as low control accuracy and poor real-time performance, which can occur easily when an autonomous vehicle avoids obstacles, this research focuses on the trajectory tracking control algorithm for autonomous vehicle considering cornering characteristics. First, the vehicle dynamics model and tire model are established through appropriate simplification. Then, based on the basic principle of model predictive control, a linear time-varying model predictive controller (LTV MPC) that considers the cornering characteristics is designed and optimized. Finally, using CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink software, a joint simulation model is established and the trajectory tracking performance of the controlled vehicle under different vehicle speeds and road adhesion conditions are tested through simulation experiments in combination with the double-shift line reference trajectory. The simulation results show the LTV MPC controller that considers cornering characteristics has good self-adaptability under complicated and severe working conditions, and no cases, such as car sideslip or track departure, were observed. Compared with other controllers and algorithms, the designed trajectory tracking controller has remarkable comprehensive performance, exhibits superior robustness and anti-interference ability, and significant improvements in the trajectory tracking control accuracy and real-time performance. The proposed control algorithm is of great importance in improving the tracking stability and driving safety of autonomous vehicles under complex extreme conditions and conducive to the further development and improvement of the technological level of intelligent vehicle driving assistance."
9575439,Optimization-based Maneuver Planning for a Tractor-Trailer Vehicle in Complex Environments using Safe Travel Corridors,"A solution for a tractor-trailer vehicle's generic maneuver planning task can be introduced by an optimal control problem (OCP). However, the curse of dimensionality is excited along with the OCP solution due to the collision-avoidance constraints in a large scale. The collision-avoidance conditions are weakened by simply constructing a corridor along a homotopically guiding route such that the vehicle's maneuvers are safely separated from obstacles. This approach is motivated by the safe flight corridor (SFC) applied for path planning of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). But SFC cannot be applied directly to the ground vehicle cases because a tractor-trailer vehicle cannot be modeled as a mass point in a narrow environment. An extension of the SFC is proposed, which requires different bodies of a multi-body vehicle to stay in different safe travel corridors. In this way, a reduced-scale OCP is formulated, and the problem scale becomes irrelevant to the environmental complexity. Simulation results illustrate that near-optimal maneuvers can be derived within less CPU time."
9040676,Path Tracking and Direct Yaw Moment Coordinated Control Based on Robust MPC With the Finite Time Horizon for Autonomous Independent-Drive Vehicles,"It is a striking fact that the characteristics of parametric uncertainties, external disturbance, time-varying and nonlinearities are available in the constructed model of autonomous independent-drive vehicles; therefore, in this paper, the robust model predictive control (MPC) with the finite time horizon is proposed to realize the coordinated path tracking and direct yaw moment control (DYC) for autonomous four in-wheel motor independent-drive electric vehicles (AMIDEV). Firstly, considering the time-varying and uncertain feature of the tire cornering stiffness and the vehicle velocity in the state space equation constructed by 2 degrees of freedom (DoF) vehicle model and the path tracking preview model, the linear parameter varying (LPV) discrete model with four polytypic vertexes is constructed. Then, based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, the novel robust MPC theory with the finite time horizon is put forward to solve the min-max optimization problem after updating four polytypic vertexes in real time, which could deal with the inevitable model mismatch problem caused by the time-varying, uncertain vehicle dynamic characteristics and external disturbance. Finally, the simulation and experimental results have verified that the proposed novel robust MPC theory could emerge from the stranglehold exercised by the conservativeness of the traditional robust MPC theory with the infinite time horizon, which strengthens the robustness of this control system as well as achieves better path tracking accuracy and handling ability of AMIDEV."
9268305,Longitudinal and Lateral Integrated Safe Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Vehicle via Friction Limit,"Due to the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, various path planning algorithms are being developed. However, most path planning algorithms operate in general and safety scenarios, and in emergency scenarios, the autonomous emergency brake (AEB) and autonomous emergency steering (AES) systems are operated limitedly. In an emergency situation in which the vehicle dynamic characteristics changed, planning a safe trajectory that can be safely tracking in necessary. In this study, a safe trajectory planning method in which the vehicle does not lose stability by using combined longitudinal and lateral acceleration vectors is proposed. The combined acceleration vector is limited by friction limit. The proposed trajectory planning algorithm is evaluated by simulation in a single obstacle scenario through comparison with existing AEB and AES algorithms. The simulation results show the proposed algorithm generates only safe trajectory that guarantee the vehicle stability, excluding dangerous trajectories when the AEB and AES algorithms operated."
8370800,"Decision-Making Framework for Autonomous Driving at Road Intersections: Safeguarding Against Collision, Overly Conservative Behavior, and Violation Vehicles","In this paper, we propose a decision-making framework for autonomous driving at road intersections that determines appropriate maneuvers for an autonomous vehicle to navigate an intersection safely and efficiently (regarding making progress), even in the face of violation vehicles-one of the most challenging tasks in the domain of autonomous vehicles. The proposed framework uses a digital map to predict future paths of observed vehicles and then uses the predicted future paths to identify potential threats (vehicles) and collision areas, regardless of whether observed vehicles are obeying traffic rules at the intersection. Next, under an independent and distributed reasoning structure, it systematically, reliably, and robustly assesses the potential threats, even under incomplete and uncertain noise data, by way of a threat measure, Bayesian networks, and time window filtering. It then uses this information to determine appropriate maneuvers for the autonomous vehicle to navigate the intersection safely and efficiently. We have tested and evaluated the proposed framework through in-vehicle testing on a closed urban test road under traffic conditions inclusive of nonviolation and violation vehicles. In-vehicle testing results show the performance of the proposed framework to be sufficiently reliable for autonomous driving at intersections regarding reliability, robustness, safety, and efficiency."
8892730,Constrained Optimization and Distributed Model Predictive Control-Based Merging Strategies for Adjacent Connected Autonomous Vehicle Platoons,"Vehicle platooning has been a major research topic in recent years because of its ability to reduce fuel consumption, enhance road traffic safety and utilize the road more efficiently. A practical and applicable platoon merging maneuver is the key to forming new platoons while ensuring safety and economy. This study proposes merging strategies that consider both safe space and acceleration limitations for two adjacent platoons comprising connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm is adopted to design a DMPC 2 controller, which includes 1) a space-making DMPC controller that controls the vehicles in one platoon, i.e. the target platoon, to make space for the vehicles in a second platoon, i.e. the merge platoon, and 2) a DMPC platoon controller that controls the merging vehicles to fill in the space in the target platoon. The former considers the explicit acceleration constraint of the vehicle, making the generated trajectory more feasible, and the latter controls the merge platoon to perform an overall mergence, which reduces the complexity of the merge problem. The low computation load of DMPC makes online computing and real-time control possible in practical scenarios. A simulation study is conducted with different scenarios and parameters, and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is more feasible and efficient, and less time-consuming than the existing state-of-the-art methods and have the advantages of taking safety distance and control input constraints into account."

9235659,Speed Planning for Autonomous Driving in Dynamic Urban Driving Scenarios,"Trajectory planning is essential for autonomous vehicles when operating in dynamic traffic environments. A layered approach usually separates out into path planning and speed planning. In the work reported in this paper, speed profile planning over a given path, which is defined by a trajectory planner, is proposed. The relevant information is provided by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. First, a speed planning optimization algorithm which considers safety, time efficiency, smoothness and comfort constraints is presented. This strategy can provide a safe, comfortable and feasible speed profile for autonomous driving via a S-T graph under a complex traffic environment. Secondly, a conventional non-convex optimization problem is translated into a quadratic programming problem. This has the advantage of a low computation requirement because it uses a CFS (convex feasible set) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through simulation studies in various urban driving scenarios. This holistic approach provides a more effective approach to speed and trajectory planning."
9002065,Obstacle Detection Using Sensor Based System For An Four Wheeled Autonomous Electric Robot,"Recently, many industries are using autonomous robots due to their high performance and reliability and which remains as a great help for human beings. Autonomous cars are considered as one of the most trending topics all over the web a car with no steering wheels, pedal, and with the most advanced technology autopilot.

9712223,A Novel Combined Decision and Control Scheme for Autonomous Vehicle in Structured Road Based on Adaptive Model Predictive Control,"In the research of autonomous vehicles, most existing studies treat the decision/planning and control as two separate problems. This idea originates from robotics. But since there are essential differences between robot and autonomous vehicle, the structure in Robotics may not be suitable for autonomous vehicles. Considering decision/planning and control separately may affect the performance of autonomous vehicle under complex driving conditions. To fill in the research gap, this paper proposes a novel scheme which considers the local motion planning and control in a combined manner. Firstly, the local motion planning is transformed into the longitudinal control problem based on the proposed scenario adaptive MPC, by which the motion behavior (driving along the global path, car-following, lane-change) can be automatically decided. Then, the lateral MPC controller is designed to track the global path and conduct the local motion commands. To ensure the performance of the path tracking control and a smooth lane-change process simultaneously, an adaptive weight mechanism is introduced in the lateral controller. Comprehensive case studies including both straight and curve road are conducted based on Carsim-Simulink co-simulation platform. The results show that the proposed algorithm can not only ensure the vehicle safety in complex driving conditions, but also ensure that the vehicle can drive at its desired velocity as much as possible by intelligently judging the most proper motion behaviors."

Autonomous driving systems are becoming more complicated and must be successfully checked before implementation. Within this framework, falls our research work. The key purpose of this paper is to implement a simulation environment for autonomous vehicles. We first created this environment which is a novel high fidelity driving simulator that can connect arbitrary interfaces, build simulated worlds consisting of scenarios and incidents experienced by drivers in real-world driving, and incorporate fully autonomous driving. The simulator makes possible to clone the behavior of human driver face as well as some complex situations such as obstacle avoidance maneuvers. The work consists in creating a virtual simulation environment to collect training data used to train vehicles on how to steer themselves. The simulator is, thus, like a video game of car racing. Indeed we used the scenes to make some driving experiences. After collecting the training data, we chose to use deep learning explicitly Convolutional Neural Networks to create a model for autonomous vehicles that avoid obstacles. Clearly, the true challenge for an autonomous vehicle is to navigate without the possibility of collision. This simulator is invested to assess the performance of an autonomous vehicle and to analyze its self-driving activities. In this method, the suggested solution proves to be feasible, efficient and reliable for autonomous vehicle simulation research."

Sliding mode control, multilayer neural network, and adaptive robust techniques are employed to design a formation controller for underwater vehicles. After that, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis is proposed to guarantee that all variables are uniformly ultimately bounded in the closed-loop control system. The following advantages of this approach are highlighted: 1) the proposed control strategy only depends on the measurements of line-of-sight and angle sensors; no other information about the leader vehicle is required; 2) a continuous function is designed to replace the signum term in the control system, which greatly reduces the inherent chattering of sliding mode controller; 3) the proposed controller does not rely on any prior knowledge about hydrodynamic damping and external disturbances, which is easily implemented in practice. Finally, the numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller."
8731685,Torque-Vectoring-Based Backup Steering Strategy for Steer-by-Wire Autonomous Vehicles With Vehicle Stability Control,"Steer-by-wire (SBW) systems provide significant benefits to classical vehicles, and are indispensable for fully autonomous vehicles (AVs). A backup (emergency) strategy is needed to steer an AV equipped with SBW to safety if its steering actuator fails completely. Differential drive assisted steering (DDAS), which uses torque vectoring(TV) to steer a vehicle in the absence of a steering actuator, has been proposed as a backup strategy for SBW systems. However, vehicle stability control (VSC) - a required feature in most modern vehicles - also relies on TV to assist vehicles in maintaining stability. In this paper, it is shown through stability analyses on a linearized vehicle model that VSC enhances the stability of an AV equipped with a fully functional SBW system. Conversely, when combined with DDAS as a backup steering strategy for a failed SBW system, VSC typically deteriorates stability. Thus, the benefits of VSC in ensuring stability cannot be taken for granted for AVs, e.g., by designing it as a decoupled controller added on to DDAS. Instead, VSC and DDAS must be designed in an integrated manner to guarantee stability. To support this finding, simulations are conducted where a nonlinear AV model with either SBW or DDAS - both combined with VSC and implemented via model predictive control - are used to carry out an ISO-standard double lane change test at 80 km/h. Using the SBW system, the AV passes the test, both with VSC decoupled from and integrated with the SBW system. However, in the case of SBW failure, the AV with VSC decoupled from DDAS fails the test, while that with VSC integrated with DDAS completes the test successfully."
9310276,Real-Time Adaptive Velocity Optimization for Autonomous Electric Cars at the Limits of Handling,"With the evolution of self-driving cars, autonomous racing series like Roborace and the Indy Autonomous Challenge are rapidly attracting growing attention. Researchers participating in these competitions hope to subsequently transfer their developed functionality to passenger vehicles, in order to improve self-driving technology for reasons of safety, and due to environmental and social benefits. The race track has the advantage of being a safe environment where challenging situations for the algorithms are permanently created. To achieve minimum lap times on the race track, it is important to gather and process information about external influences including, e.g., the position of other cars and the friction potential between the road and the tires. Furthermore, the predicted behavior of the ego-car's propulsion system is crucial for leveraging the available energy as efficiently as possible. In this paper, we therefore present an optimization-based velocity planner, mathematically formulated as a multi-parametric Sequential Quadratic Problem (mpSQP). This planner can handle a spatially and temporally varying friction coefficient, and transfer a race Energy Strategy (ES) to the road. It further handles the velocity-profile-generation task for performance and emergency trajectories in real time on the vehicle's Electronic Control Unit (ECU)."
9161791,Vehicle Detection in the Autonomous Vehicle Environment for Potential Collision Warning,"In this paper, a method for the vehicles detection in the surroundings of an autonomous vehicle and warnings of potential collision with them is presented. The method, which consists of two parts, is implemented in robot operating system (ROS). The first part is used to detect vehicles in an autonomous vehicle environment, in which, YOLO v2 algorithm, trained on a newly created set of images, is used. The YOLO v2 algorithm is configured to detect four classes of objects: a car, a van, a truck, and a bus. The second part of the proposed method is the ROS node for distance assessment. In particular, two ROS nodes for distance assessment are created; one ROS node used for distance assessment in the Carla simulator, while the other ROS node is used for real-world distance assessment. The testing results of the proposed method show promising results."

8867197,3D Cubic Bezier Curves for Multi-target Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"This paper presents a new method to design the shortest smooth 3D path for multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to visit multiple targets. This path planning method can be separated into the target assignment problem and path designing problem. For the target assignment problem, we compare the genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization algorithm to get target sequence for each AUV with less distance cost. For the given target sequence for each AUVs, the path designing problem is to design shortest smooth path for visiting each target with constraint of G 1 continuity. This paper designs 3D Bezier curves by selecting the control points along the incoming and out-going heading direction. Each two-target segment has a set of discrete in-coming and out-going heading direction. For multi-target path planning, the in-coming heading direction and the out-going heading direction at each target have to be the same and the shortest path is selected via back propagation algorithm. It is proved that the combined 3D cubic Bezier curves ensure G 1 continuity along the entire multi-target path. Back propagation algorithm is applied to find the shortest curve sequence for multiple targets."
9292629,A Risk-Aware Architecture for Autonomous Vehicle Operation Under Uncertainty,"A significant barrier to deploying autonomous vehicles (AVs) on a massive scale is safety assurance. Several technical challenges arise due to the uncertain environment in which AVs operate, such as road and weather conditions, errors in perception and sensory data, and model inaccuracy. This paper proposes a system architecture for risk-aware AVs capable of reasoning about uncertainty and deliberately bounding collision risk below a given threshold. The system comprises of three main subsystems. First, a perception subsystem that detects objects within a scene and quantifies the uncertainty arising from different sensing and communication modalities. Second, an intention recognition subsystem that predicts the driving-style and the intention of agent vehicles and pedestrians. Third, a planning subsystem that takes into account the aggregate uncertainty, from perception, intention recognition, and tracking error, and outputs control policies that explicitly bound the probability of collision. We deliberate further on the planner and show, in simulation, that tuning a risk parameter can significantly alter driving behavior. We believe that such a white-box approach is crucial for safe and explainable autonomous driving and the public adoption of AVs."
9338655,"Adaptive Sensor Fusion of Camera, GNSS and IMU for Autonomous Driving Navigation","The Visual-Inertial navigation system(VINS) has become a popular navigation approach in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles(UAV) or robotics. While its performance under autonomous driving scenario is not satisfactory due to the fact that autonomous driving scenario is more challenging and dynamic than the UAV scenario. Thus, the Visual-Inertial navigation system will collapse occasionally and thus undermine the navigation result. In this work, we propose a adaptive mechanism that could switch between three modes, only VINs, only GNSS and VINS&GNSS fusion. When Visual-Inertial component breaks down, our algorithm could only rely on the GNSS signal until VINS recovers. Similarly, when GNSS signal is not very accurate, our system could only rely on the VINS-Mono. We demonstrate our algorithm under challenging scenarios such as night sight and high speed road and do both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis."
9371664,Ranking the Key Areas for Autonomous Proving Ground Development Using Pareto Analytic Hierarchy Process,"Autonomous or highly automated road vehicles and all related technologies are under intensive research and development. Moreover, internationally a massive investment increase can be observed in the automotive industry. According to this megatrend, new automotive test tracks appear or older ones transform to be capable of testing and proving for autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the question emerges: what are the key areas for automated drive development, which must be financed in case of autonomous proving ground design? It is a real challenge to be able to make the right decisions due to a lack of numerous experiences in this field. In this research, experts of automated driving technology have been surveyed and their opinion and knowledge have been synthesized. As a strong purpose of gaining robust results, the conventional AHP has been amended by the Pareto approach to ensure that the derived weights correspond to the expert scoring intention so perfectly that it cannot be more improved. Since the non-Pareto optimal weight results might cause rank reversal in the final prioritization, the applied Pareto test guarantees that the final outcome reflects the expert evaluators' incentive. The conducted analysis has indicated that the obtained results are robust not only from the sensitivity point of view but also from the Pareto optimality approach. The proposed hierarchical decision model is therefore applicable to assist decision making for autonomous proving ground developments. The main contribution of the article, however, is to present the first reliable prioritization of the autonomous proving ground elements to extend the body of professional knowledge."
9067008,A Decision-Making Strategy for Vehicle Autonomous Braking in Emergency via Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Autonomous braking through vehicle precise decision-making and control to reduce accidents is a key issue, especially in the early diffusion phase of autonomous vehicle development. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based autonomous braking decision-making strategy in an emergency situation. Three key influencing factors, including efficiency, accuracy and passengers' comfort, are fully considered and satisfied by the proposed strategy. First, the vehicle lane-changing process and the braking process are analyzed in detail, which include the critical factors in the design of the autonomous braking strategy. Second, we propose a DRL process that determines the optimal strategy for autonomous braking. Particularly, a multi-objective reward function is designed, which can compromise the rewards achieved of different brake moments, the degree of the accident, and the comfort of the passenger. Third, a typical actor-critic (AC) algorithm named deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is adopted for solving the autonomous braking problem, which can improve the efficiency of the optimal strategy and be stable in continuous control tasks. Once the strategy is well trained, the vehicle can automatically take optimal braking behavior in an emergency to improve driving safety. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal in terms of learning effectiveness, decision-making accuracy and driving safety."
8957268,Improving Lateral Autonomous Driving in Snow-Wet Environments Based on Road-Mark Reconstruction Using Principal Component Analysis,"Lateral localization is a very sensible factor for evaluating the performance of autonomous driving. This paper addresses the general reasons of the lateral drifting by analyzing the performance of an accurate localization system at level of 10∼20 cm. The performance drops into 0.4∼3 m in winter because of the snow and wet road surface representations in the LIDAR data. Accordingly, we prove that enhancing the quality of online LIDAR data before calculating the matching score with the map is a key-solution to improve the lateral accuracy. This can be achieved by filtering-out snow, regenerating the road edges at correct positions and sharping-up the lane lines. To achieve these objectives, we propose a machine learning based road-mark reconstruction framework. The map images are converted into edge profiles to represent the road-marks in a series of peaks. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to model the relationships between these peaks and extract the dominant distribution patterns. Based on the leading eigenvectors (eigenroads), the LIDAR edge profiles are safely and efficiently reconstructed during the autonomous driving. The reliability of the proposed framework has been tested using map data generated in 2015 and LIDAR data collected in 2016 and 2017 in snowy and rainy weather conditions. The experimental results have verified the robustness and truthfulness of the proposed framework to significantly improve the lateral accuracy in the LIDAR based localization systems. The localization accuracy has been enhanced to be 96.4% for 15 cm average error in very critical situations of changing the road patterns and the environmental conditions. The reliability of the proposed framework has been tested using map data generated in 2015 and LIDAR data collected in 2016 and 2017 in snowy and rainy weather conditions. The experimental results have verified the robustness and truthfulness of the proposed framework to significantly improve the lateral accuracy in th...

8695742,A Model Predictive Controller With Switched Tracking Error for Autonomous Vehicle Path Tracking,"Autonomous vehicle path tracking accuracy and vehicle stability can hardly be accomplished by one fixed control frame in various conditions due to the changing vehicle dynamics. This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) path-tracking controller with switched tracking error, which reduces the lateral tracking deviation and maintains vehicle stability for both normal and high-speed conditions. The design begins by comparing the performance of three MPC controllers with different tracking error. The analyzing results indicate that in the steady-state condition the controller with the velocity heading deviation as the tracking error significantly improves the tracking accuracy. Meanwhile, in the transient condition, by substituting the steady-state sideslip for real-time sideslip to compute the velocity heading deviation, the tracking overshoot can be reduced. To combine the strengths of these two methods, an MPC controller with switched tracking error is designed to improve the performance in both steady-state and transient conditions. The regime condition of a vehicle maneuver and the switching instant are determined by a fuzzy-logic-based condition classifier. Both normal and aggressive driving scenarios with the vehicle lateral and longitudinal acceleration combination of 5 m/s 2 and 8 m/s 2 are designed to test the proposed controller through CarSim-Simulink platform. The simulation results show the improved performance of the MPC controller with switched tracking error both in tracking accuracy and vehicle stability in both scenarios."
8915728,Space Distribution Method for Autonomous Vehicles at a Signalized Multi-Lane Intersection,"Under the connected vehicle environment, autonomous vehicles (AVs) could bring numerous advantages including: improving the traffic flow, enhancing safety and alleviating air pollution. However, optimally operating AVs at signalized multi-lane intersections is a challenging problem due to the complex interaction of vehicles between lanes. It is thus a desire to manage and control the dynamics of AVs at signalized multi-lane intersections. To this end, this paper puts forward a bi-level control framework to optimize the intersection throughput. In our proposed method, the upper level (i.e. the intersection controller) is used to optimize the lane usages of each approach and the AVs' positions. In contrast, the lower level (i.e. the vehicle controllers) receives information from the upper level to control the AVs to get the maximum speed. More specifically, in the upper level, we apply a novel Space Distribution Method (SDM) for the AVs to maximize the throughput (i.e. a number of AVs) of the (multi-lane) intersection where signal timings are predefined. The SDM is divided into three steps: i) platoon formulation; ii) lane-mode optimization; and iii) AVs' position distribution. To maximize the throughput, the intersection controller receives information about the states of the AVs (e.g. the trajectories), then optimizes the lane usages for each approach, the desired speed, and the gap of the AVs as well as the AV's position along the approach. After that, each AV which is allowed to cross the intersection will determine its own trajectory and travel with the scheduled time without crash. Numerical simulations are set up to show that the throughput increases significantly, even more than twice of the throughput obtained from other methods in some circumstances."
9129770,Robust Trajectory Tracking Control for Underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles in Uncertain Environments,"This article addresses the tracking control problem of 3-D trajectories for underactuated underwater robotic vehicles operating in a constrained workspace including obstacles. More specifically, a robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is presented for the case of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) (i.e., unicycle-like vehicles actuated only in the surge, heave, and yaw). The purpose of the controller is to steer the unicycle-like AUV to the desired trajectory with guaranteed input and state constraints (e.g., obstacles, predefined vehicle velocity bounds, and thruster saturations) inside a partially known and dynamic environment where the knowledge of the operating workspace is constantly updated via the vehicle’s onboard sensors. In particular, considering the sensing range of the vehicle, obstacle avoidance with any of the detected obstacles is guaranteed by the online generation of a collision-free trajectory tracking path, despite the model dynamic uncertainties and the presence of external disturbances representing ocean currents and waves. Finally, realistic simulation studies verify the performance and efficiency of the proposed framework. Note to Practitioners —This article was motivated by the problem of robust trajectory tracking for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operating in an uncertain environment where the knowledge of the operating workspace (e.g., obstacle positions) is constantly updated online via the vehicle’s onboard sensors (e.g., multibeam imaging sonars and laser-based vision systems). In addition, there may be other system limitations (e.g., thruster saturation limits) and other operational constraints, induced by the need of various common underwater tasks (e.g., a predefined vehicle speed limit for inspecting the seabed, and mosaicking), where it should also be considered into the control strategy. However, based on the existing trajectory tracking control approaches for underwater robotics, ther...

9294495,Subtype Divergences of Trust in Autonomous Vehicles: Towards Optimisation of Driver–Vehicle Trust Management,"Trust determines public acceptance and uptake of autonomous vehicles (AV). Against popular assumption, trustin-automation is not a unitary construct, but comprises trust subtypes that have different behavioural properties and implications. Understanding trust subtypes-specifically competence-based trust (CT) and integrity-based trust (IT)-is crucial for improving public communication about AVs, analysing trustdependent driver behaviours and designing trust-recovering interfaces. However, these issues have been overlooked in most past research. As a pioneering step, the goal of this research was to analyse how experience with AV failures affect CT and IT. After experience with AV driving errors, both trust subtypes were reduced, with CT showing greater reduction. Structural equation modelling revealed CT to be the primary contributor to acceptance for driving automation, with stronger subsequent impact on preference for fully autonomous (SAE L5) than on semi-autonomous driving (SAE L3). These findings inform that trust-repairing interface should target CT after driving errors, especially for higher automation levels where humans are further removed from the loop. Future directions concerning CT-IT interactions, and the impact of AV anthropomorphic design and connnected vehicle cyber-security on IT are discussed."

Among them, the autonomous vehicle industry has developed considerably, and researches has been carried out actively on self-driving control systems using artificial intelligence. Recently, studies have been conducted on the use of image-based end-to-end deep learning to control autonomous driving systems. An image-based end-to-end autonomous system can be configured at a low cost, in a simple system that omits complex processes. This system receives images as the input and outputs control signals. In this paper, we propose an autonomous driving control system by using end-to-end deep learning."
9382712,A Robust Strategy of Map Quality Assessment for Autonomous Driving based on LIDAR Road-Surface Reflectance,"Automatic map quality assessment is a very important process to bring the mapping modules into levels four and five of autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a robust framework to check the map quality on behalf of human beings with indicating the possible ghost areas without using ground truth. The essence is to conduct the assessment process in the image domain instead of the point cloud plane. Therefore, the road is described by a set of nodes and each node represents a considerable road texture in Absolute Coordinate System using LIDAR reflectivity. This converts the vehicle trajectory into grayscale images with encoding stationary landmarks and road shapes. In addition, the global position errors are converted into relative position errors between the nodes and transformed into ghosting effects in the image domain. Accordingly, a mechanism to evaluate the map quality at the revisited areas is proposed based on sharpness, luminance and structure factors of the road surface. The framework has been tested in challenging environments including open-sky areas, the world's second-longest tunnel and courses of dense trees and high buildings. The experimental results have verified the novelty and reliability of the proposed strategy to provide very trustful map quality assessment by relying on map images only. Moreover, the system is scalable to compare the maps and significantly indicates the outperformance in terms of accuracy and quality."
9605171,Attitude Control Based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Multi-mission Motion Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Due to the limitations of classical control strategies for underwater vehicles, the artificial intelligent control technologies have attracted more attention than ever, especially the Deep Reinforcement Learning. However, it is usually confusing to choose a proper Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm and to configurate an effective reward function according to different autonomous underwater vehicle assignments. To solve the problem, this research explores three different missions that autonomous underwater vehicle might perform, with two Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms and three reward functions adopted respectively. Deep Reinforcement Learning controllers take the attitude sensor information as input, the control signals of X-rudder blades as output. The simulation experiments results are compared and analyzed, which has an important reference value for the reward function setting and Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm selection for different autonomous underwater vehicle control tasks."
8723597,Vision-Based Autonomous Path Following Using a Human Driver Control Model With Reliable Input-Feature Value Estimation,"Autonomous vehicles differ from many other autonomous systems in the sense that these vehicles have to share the environment with humans (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers in traffic). This requirement poses a challenging perception and planning problem. Our research focuses on the problem of a vehicle sharing the environment with a human passenger/driver and, specifically, of designing a controller that captures the natural tendencies of the human driver so as to guarantee that the resulting control action is comparable to that of the human. In this paper, we propose to use a human driver control model into the autonomous vehicle control framework, which has previously been shown to predict short-term driver actions, and we develop an approach that reliably and accurately estimates input-feature values from driver-point-of-view images. After the feature-input values have been estimated, the human driver control model computes the corresponding steering-wheel angle. We, thus, provide more structure to the overall processing pipeline, compared to the recent end-to-end approaches. The proposed approach is validated using numerical simulations with synthetic images. The results validate the importance of combining traditional structured (e.g., transfer function) models with parsimonious neural-network representations."
8790807,Design and Experimental Validation of a Distributed Interaction Protocol for Connected Autonomous Vehicles at a Road Intersection,"This paper presents a fully distributed interaction protocol for connected self-driving cars negotiating the access a traffic junction. The vehicles coordination has been reformulated as an equivalent virtual platoon control problem. The desired vehicles spacing within the platoon is chosen so to avoid the side and rear-end collisions and is controlled by a cooperative non-linear control algorithm, based on potential functions. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system has been analytically proved by leveraging the LaSalle's Invariance Principle. The analysis of the convergence rate has resulted in an effective tuning tool ensuring that the desired formation is achieved before vehicles reach the intersection. Most notably, results from an in-vehicle experimental validation are presented. The experiments were carried out on three self-driving cars connected through a V2V communication infrastructure based on the IEEE 802.11p protocol. The experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis and reveal the effectiveness of the control approach for autonomously and safely negotiating a generic traffic junction."

Simulation results show that PRELSA framework improves learning speed by about 20 percent compared to existing learning method.
9219194,Autonomous Wary Collision Avoidance,"Handling of critical situations is an important part in the architecture of an autonomous vehicle. A controller for autonomous collision avoidance is developed based on a wary strategy that assumes the least tire-road friction for which the maneuver is still feasible. Should the friction be greater, the controller makes use of this, and performs better. The controller uses an acceleration-vector reference obtained from optimal control of a friction-limited particle, whose applicability is verified by using numerical optimization on a full vehicle model. By employing an analytical tire model of the tire-road friction limit, to determine slip references for steering, and body-slip control, the result is a controller where the computation of its output is explicit, and independent of the actual tire-road friction. When evaluated in real-time on a high-fidelity simulation model, the developed controller performs close to that achieved by offline numerical optimization."

When the power of a drone is about to run out, the unmanned ground vehicle will be controlled to go to a position near the drone to wait the drone lands on the UGV. Since an ArUco marker is designed on the UGV, the UGV can be located by detecting the ArUco marker, and assists for the drone landing.

The key to the perception system holding responsibility to collect the information in the outside world and determine the safety of the vehicle is a variety of sensors mounting on it. However, each of the sensors has its strengths and weaknesses, so fusing them can fill out the gap between sensors and make the self-driving system more reliable.

In this paper, we conducted a case study on collision avoidance in a waypoint tracking situation. To avoid the obstacle, we proposed a desired lateral offset from the global route and used the offset as a reference for avoidance. Then, we defined a quadratic cost function considering the jerk to minimize a motion sickness during the avoidance maneuver. To verify the method, we executed a computational simulation using actual waypoint data. As a result, we observed that the proposed scheme has more comfortability for obstacle avoidance than the method without optimizing the jerk."
8943322,Review of Wireless Charging Systems for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used for undersea exploration. The endurance of AUVs is limited by the onboard energy storage among which the battery systems dominate. Various underwater recharging methods are employed to increase the AUV range and autonomy. Currently, contact-based underwater recharging utilizes the wet-mate connector technology that requires a high-precision AUV docking, and is prone to electrical safety issues. To overcome these limitations, underwater wireless recharging techniques for AUVs have been explored in recent years. Wireless charging offers a safe and reliable method for autonomous power transfer between a charging station and a vehicle. This article reviews the state-of-the-art inductive wireless power transfer (IWPT) solutions for underwater applications and discusses the engineering challenges of the IWPT system design. Underwater environmental factors, such as seawater conductivity, temperature, pressure, water currents, and biofouling phenomenon, impose constraints on IWPT systems. A comprehensive review of AUV energy storage systems, docking methods, IWPT system control methods, and compensation networks is presented in this article. Based on the main operational and constructional principles, the AUV IWPT systems are categorized as loosely coupled transformers and resonant IWPT systems. Each of the categories is illustrated through their main design principles and implementations reported in the literature so far. Technical challenges, such as integration of IWPT system into an AUV hull, interoperability, alignment and retention issues, docking station sinking and stability, the design of pressure-tolerant charging electronics, data transfer, and the battery operation in the underwater environment are discussed in this article too. The article is concluded with the best practice overview of designing an IWPT system for AUVs."
8911511,Autonomous Vehicles’ Turning Motion Planning for Conflict Areas at Mixed-Flow Intersections,"An essential and challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is turning at mixed-flow intersections when they interact with motorized, non-motorized and pedestrian traffic simultaneously. In these situations, sensor measurement noise and blind zones create additional complexity in an already problematic environment. In order to make motion planning feasible in a multi-interaction environment with detection uncertainty feasible, this article proposes a hierarchical framework that divides the highly-related driving process into a decision, planning and action layer. The decision layer first employs a logit model combined with Bayes' theorem to make a discrete choice about whether to turn or not. Then, the plan layer initializes a local trajectory with selected waypoints considering the location of interacting objects based on a Bézier curve. Finally, feedback is used to adjust the vehicle's decision and trajectory plan when collision risks increase due to the unexpected behavior of other objects. Additionally, in order to consider sensor data noise and blind zones of AVs, an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) was used to estimate the status of sensory targets. The performance of the proposed model was compared with drivers' performance for the same turning scenarios at two mixed-flow intersections. The results show that the simulation produced human-like flexibility when planning trajectories in a multi-interaction environment. Moreover, the travel time of AVs did not show a statistically significant difference when compared with manually driven vehicles (MVs). Instead, the AVs actually performed better in terms of safety than the MVs."

8836794,Autonomous Navigation of a Small-Scale Ground Vehicle Using Low-Cost IMU/GPS Integration for Outdoor Applications,This paper describes the development of an autonomous navigation system for a small-scale ground vehicle which uses four independent DC motors for propulsion and an Arduino Mega2560 as its onboard computing plataform. The vehicle sensory system is composed of a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (which includes 3 magnetometers) and a standard GPS receiver. The onboard computer sends data from the onboard sensors to a Ground Control Station (GCS) and receives navigation commands from it. These commands are then used to drive the ground vehicle's DC motors using PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) signals. The Ground Control Station software implements an Extended Kalman Filter for sensor data fusion. An ethernet shield and an ethernet wifi bridge are used for wireless communication between the vehicle onboard computer and the Ground Control Station. A two-wheeled vehicle model was used to develop the vehicle controller and to tune the Kalman Filter parameters. Simulations and real-world test results of the proposed autonomous navigation procedure are presented and discussed for a path-following experiment.

9410238,Proactive Scheduling and Resource Management for Connected Autonomous Vehicles: A Data Science Perspective,"Carpooling and the ride-sharing idea are currently resolving many issues faced by modern societies. The issues regarding the overuse of oil, traffic jams, inefficient use of time, pollution due to overuse of vehicles on the road, and health problems. It is also expected that ride-sharing and carpooling will be more efficient for autonomous vehicles because of their unmanned nature and full-fledged autonomy. When unmanned cars will do the responsibility of carpooling and ride-sharing or car-hailing, many issues regarding booking rides, location sharing, payment handling, and privacy issues must be improved. To cope with these issues, mainly concerning the scheduling of resources, we need effective scheduling techniques to handle all kinds of emotional problems and provide a pollution-free and accident-free environment on autonomous vehicles’ roads. Among other approaches, we feel that Data Science provides a perfect opportunity to leverage machine learning models to classify and see what parameters can encourage people to opt for a move towards connected autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we discuss autonomous vehicles, Vehicle-as-a-Service, and their role in reducing CO2 emissions. The dataset used in this study gives insights into the city of Chicago’s taxi trips. The dataset includes data about taxi trips, their respective duration, and anonymized data about the passengers. We also discuss some studies by a taxonomy that will identify the gap of an optimal incentive mechanism that will influence users to join carpooling in autonomous cars instead of having their vehicles."
8767390,A Study on Behavior of Autonomous Vehicles Cooperating with Manually-Driven Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles will bring tremendous benefits to society. However, it is expected to take a considerable period of time for their spread, and during the transition period, autonomous and manually-driven vehicles will share the same roads. Under such situations, the driving behavior of autonomous vehicles will influence manual drivers, for example, manually-driven vehicles may be stuck behind the autonomous vehicles and overtake them frequently if autonomous vehicles drive slowly for safety. In this paper, we investigate how the traffic flow and driving stress vary with autonomous vehicles by microscopic traffic simulation. We develop a microscopic traffic simulator that can reproduce traffic flow with autonomous vehicles and manually-driven vehicles. The behavior of these vehicles can be modeled by the combination of Intelligent-Driver Model (IDM) and Lane change Model with Relaxation and Synchronization (LMRS). These models can express various driver characteristics through simulation parameters such as driving speed and distance between vehicles (net distance), and we are able to create realistic scenarios like overtaking autonomous vehicles by manually-driven vehicles with faster speed than the legal speed. From the simulation results, we found that there is a desirable combination of speed and time headway that achieves both smooth traffic and less stress of drivers with a given percentage of autonomous vehicles."

According to the kinematic equation of RWDA vehicles and the desired trajectory, the tracking error system during the autonomous driving process is first built, where the denial-of-service (DoS) attacking signals are injected into the networked communication and transmission. Combining the event-triggered sampling mechanism and iterative single critic learning framework, a new event-triggered condition is developed for the adaptive resilient control algorithm, and the novel utility function design is considered for driving the autonomous vehicle, where the control input can be guaranteed into an applicable saturated bound. Finally, we apply the new adaptive resilient control scheme to a case of driving the RWDA vehicles, and the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and practicality successfully."

9384830,Evaluation of Two Path Following Controllers for an Ackermann Off-road Vehicle in Winter and Summer Conditions,"Off-road driving can be a challenging task with rapid changes in the driving conditions, terrain and vehicle behavior. For off-road autonomous vehicles, it is important to be robust to these changes, and parts of this robustness comes from the path following controller of the vehicle. In this paper we compare two different path following controllers using a kinematic model of Ackermann vehicles, the Stanley controller and a controller originally made for unicycles, but adapted for Ackermann vehicles. The comparison is done using an Off-road Polaris vehicle modified for autonomous driving. Two experiments are conducted, where the first experiment is during wintertime, driving with belts in snowy conditions, and the second experiments is during summer time, driving with wheels in muddy conditions. Our research vehicle can be fitted with different payloads that affect the weight and center of gravity. Therefore our main motivation for using kinematic controllers is to have a simple and robust controller that handles all situations using the same control parameters. Both controllers are used on the same path, and the cross-track errors are compared. The main conclusion is that the Stanley controller showed the most robustness against variations in driving conditions and vehicle dynamics, compared to the adapted unicycle method."
9032103,An Improved Kinematic Model Predictive Control for High-Speed Path Tracking of Autonomous Vehicles,"Kinematic model predictive control (MPC) is well known for its simplicity and computational efficiency for path tracking of autonomous vehicles, however, it merely works well at low speed. In addition, earlier studies have demonstrated that tracking accuracy is improved by the feedback of yaw rate, as it improves the system transients. With this in mind, it is expected that the performance of path tracking can be improved by a cascaded controller that utilizes kinematic MPC to determine desired yaw rate rather than steering angle, and uses proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control to follow the reference yaw rate. However, directly combining MPC with PID feedback control of yaw rate results in a controller with poor tracking accuracy. The simulation results show that the cascaded MPC-PID controller has relatively stable but larger error compared to classic kinematic and dynamic MPC. Based on the analysis of vehicle sideslip angle, a novel path tracking control method is proposed, which is designed using a kinematic MPC to handle the disturbances on road curvature, a PID feedback control of yaw rate to reject uncertainties and modeling errors, and a vehicle sideslip angle compensator to correct the kinematic model prediction. The proposed controller performances involving steady-state and transient response, robustness, and computing efficiency were evaluated on Carsim/Matlab joint simulation environment. Furthermore, field experiments were conducted to validate the robustness against sensor disturbances and time lag. The results demonstrate that the developed vehicle sideslip compensator is sufficient to capture steer dynamics, and the developed controller significantly improves the performance of path tracking and follows the desired path very well, ranging from low speed to high speed even at the limits of handling."
9190075,Vehicle Speed and Gear Position Co-Optimization for Energy-Efficient Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"This work proposes a real-time implementable control strategy to optimize vehicle speed and transmission gear position simultaneously for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Co-optimization of vehicle speed and transmission gear position has the advantage to maximize the fuel benefits. Drivability is considered during the optimization to satisfy the acceleration requirement and avoid shift busyness. The target vehicle's speed and gear position are controlled intelligently using predicted future traffic conditions based on information enabled by connectivity. The optimal control problem is a hybrid one with both continuous (vehicle speed) and discrete (gear position) control inputs. The problem is formulated and simplified to a mixed-integer programming problem with a convex quadratic objective function and mixed-integer linear constraints. The optimal control solutions are obtained in real time using an efficient numerical solver in the model predictive control (MPC) fashion. Future traffic conditions are anticipated using a traffic prediction method based on a traffic flow model. The traffic prediction method can be applied to scenarios where both connected vehicles and nonconnected vehicles share the road. As a case study, a vehicle platooning scenario on an urban road is evaluated in both simulation and experiment. The target vehicle is at the end of the vehicle platoon and follows the preceding vehicle. The average computational time of the optimization is 0.44 s. By co-optimizing vehicle speed and gear position, the target vehicle can achieve 10.6% fuel benefits compared with the immediate preceding vehicle and 8.9% energy benefits compared with a human-driven vehicle (driven by VISSIM's car-following model). The proposed control strategy can be potentially extended to various CAV applications and traffic scenarios as well."
9334605,Performance Analysis of Cellular-V2X with Adaptive & Selective Power Control,"LTE based Cellular Vehicle-To-Everything (C-V2X) allows vehicles to communicate with each other directly without the need for infrastructure and is expected to be a critical enabler for connected and autonomous vehicles. V2X communication based safety applications are built on periodic broadcast of basic safety messages with vehicle state information. Vehicles use this information to identify collision threats and take appropriate countermeasures. As the vehicle density increases, these broadcasts can congest the communication channel resulting in increased packet loss; fundamentally impacting the ability to identify threats in a timely manner. To address this issue, it is important to incorporate a congestion control mechanism. Congestion management scheme based on rate and power control has proved to be effective for DSRC. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of similar congestion control to C-V2X with particular focus on transmit power control. In our evaluation, we include periodic basic safety messages and high priority event messages that are generated when an event such as hard braking occurs. Our study reveals that while power control does not improve packet delivery performance of basic safety messages, it is beneficial to high priority event message delivery. In this paper, we investigate the reasons for this behavior using simulations and analysis."
9394191,Vehicle Trajectory Prediction based on Social Generative Adversarial Network for Self-Driving Car Applications,"Self-driving or autonomous vehicles need to efficiently and continuously navigate in complex traffic environments by analyzing the surrounding scene, understanding the behavior of other traffic-agents, and predicting their future trajectories. The main goal is to plan a safe motion and reduce the reaction time for possibly imminent hazards. A critical and challenging problem considered in this paper is to explore the movement patterns of surrounding traffic-agents and accurately predict their future trajectories for helping the vehicle make reasonable decision. To solve the problem, a deep learning-based framework is proposed in this paper for predicting trajectories of autonomous vehicles. The key is to train a social GAN (generative adversarial network) deep model for prediction of vehicle trajectory. The presented experimental results have verified that the proposed social GAN-based approach outperforms the traditional Social LSTM (long short-term memory)-based method."
9662198,Haptic Assistive Control with Learning-Based Driver Intent Recognition for Semi-Autonomous Vehicles,"Semi-autonomous vehicles equipped with assistive control systems may experience degraded lateral behaviors when aggressive driver steering commands compete with high levels of autonomy. This challenge can be mitigated with effective operator intent recognition, which can configure automated systems in context-specific situations where the driver intends to perform a steering maneuver. In this article, an ensemble learning-based driver intent recognition strategy has been developed. A nonlinear model predictive control algorithm has been designed and implemented to generate haptic feedback for lateral vehicle guidance, assisting the drivers in accomplishing their intended action. To validate the framework, operator-in-the-loop testing with 30 human subjects was conducted on a steer-by-wire platform with a virtual reality driving environment. The roadway scenarios included lane change, obstacle avoidance, intersection turns, and highway exit. The automated system with learning-based driver intent recognition was compared to both the automated system with a finite state machine-based driver intent estimator and the automated system without any driver intent prediction for all driving events. Test results demonstrate that semi-autonomous vehicle performance can be enhanced by up to 74.1% with a learning-based intent predictor. The holistic framework that integrates human intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and vehicle control can help solve the driver-system conflict problem leading to safer operation."

Four microscopic traffic flow models are constructed and compared by collision detection algorithm. The simulation results show that the autonomous lane change decision model in the intelligent networks environment can significantly increase the average road speed, reduce the probability of vehicle blockage, lane change and emergency braking, and improve the efficiency of traffic at intersections. At the same time, it can reduce the risk of vehicle collision due to speed dispersion."

However, most existing evaluation approaches for autonomous vehicles are static and lack adaptability, so they are usually inefficient in generating challenging scenarios for tested vehicles. In this paper, we propose an adaptive evaluation framework to efficiently evaluate autonomous vehicles in adversarial environments generated by deep reinforcement learning. Considering the multimodal nature of dangerous scenarios, we use ensemble models to represent different local optimums for diversity. We then utilize a nonparametric Bayesian method to cluster the adversarial policies. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Results show that the adversarial scenarios generated by our method significantly degrade the performance of the tested vehicles. We also illustrate different patterns of generated adversarial environments, which can be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles."

This paper proposes an inter-vehicle distance estimation framework that can consider slope changes of a road forward, by estimating road gradients of both ego vehicle and target vehicles and using a 2D object detection deep net. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the distance estimation accuracy and time complexity, compared to deep learning-based depth estimation methods."

An intention-aware prediction for other drivers via a CNN method with multiple-object tracking and Kalman-Filter operations is considered in the developed model to construct the interaction of other drivers. A human-like decision model according to the moving intention of the obstacle was proposed to generate the strategy of an autonomous vehicle. Our approach method is validated on a real autonomous vehicle in the presence of human-driven vehicles through an on-road test."
8883326,How Will Autonomous Vehicles Operate in an Unlawful Environment? - The Potential of Autonomous Vehicles for Disregarding the Law,"The future of urban transport environments is being reshaped by the potential introduction of autonomous vehicles within their networks. The development of such vehicles is implemented within closed and controlled testbeds that simulate the urban environment. The operation of such testbeds assumes that laws should regulate how traffic operates. Another assumption is that autonomous vehicles by design (through their coding) follow the existing regulations and act accordingly. However, there exist societies in which unlawful behavior has become the norm for most of its drivers. In such an environment, the traffic and infrastructure conditions themselves compel drivers to adapt to the current conditions disregarding the law in an effort to travel to their destination in an efficient - and safe - manner. A provision for the unlawful behavior of autonomous vehicles has three major requirements, namely that any such decisions are: a) technically possible b) legally defensible, and c) ethically justifiable. The technical capabilities of autonomous vehicles in making complex decisions have already been studied to some extent. To this end, the purpose of this paper is twofold. Initially, through a preliminary literature review, it is called to explore whether the concept of autonomous vehicles acting beyond established laws is defensible. Moreover, in an effort to explore the ethical justification of such behavior, this paper aims to answer two important questions. Firstly, it ascertains how drivers behave under shifting and unlawful conditions. Furthermore, it assesses whether the potential passengers of autonomous vehicles expect the vehicle to act in a manner similar to that with which they themselves would drive. These two questions form the basis of a questionnaire that is distributed amongst users of the Greek urban transport environment. This questionnaire identifies conditions under which Greek drivers would disregard the law and to what extent. Finally, the question...

8744265,Edge Computing for Autonomous Driving: Opportunities and Challenges,"Safety is the most important requirement for autonomous vehicles; hence, the ultimate challenge of designing an edge computing ecosystem for autonomous vehicles is to deliver enough computing power, redundancy, and security so as to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, autonomous driving systems are extremely complex; they tightly integrate many technologies, including sensing, localization, perception, decision making, as well as the smooth interactions with cloud platforms for high-definition (HD) map generation and data storage. These complexities impose numerous challenges for the design of autonomous driving edge computing systems. First, edge computing systems for autonomous driving need to process an enormous amount of data in real time, and often the incoming data from different sensors are highly heterogeneous. Since autonomous driving edge computing systems are mobile, they often have very strict energy consumption restrictions. Thus, it is imperative to deliver sufficient computing power with reasonable energy consumption, to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles, even at high speed. Second, in addition to the edge system design, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) provides redundancy for autonomous driving workloads and alleviates stringent performance and energy constraints on the edge side. With V2X, more research is required to define how vehicles cooperate with each other and the infrastructure. Last, safety cannot be guaranteed when security is compromised. Thus, protecting autonomous driving edge computing systems against attacks at different layers of the sensing and computing stack is of paramount concern. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art approaches in these areas as well as explore potential solutions to address these challenges."

9254313,Dynamic Prioritization of Emergency Vehicles For Self-Organizing Traffic using VTL+EV,"Cooperative vehicular technology in recent times has aided in realizing some state-of-art technologies like autonomous driving. Effective and efficient prioritization of emergency vehicles (EVs) using cooperative vehicular technology can undoubtedly aid in saving property and lives. Contemporary EV prioritization, called preemption, is highly dependent on existing traffic infrastructure. Accessing crucial decision parameters for preemption like speed, position and acceleration data in real-time is almost impossible in current systems. The connected vehicle can provide such data in real-time, which makes EV preemption more responsive and effective. Also, autonomous vehicles can help in optimizing the timing in traffic phases and minimize human-related loss like higher headway times and inconsistent inter-vehicle spacing when following each other. In this paper, we introduce self-coordinating a decentralized traffic control system termed as Virtual Traffic Light plus for Emergency Vehicle (VTL+EV) to prioritize EVs in an intersection.

First, the nonlinear control-oriented model, including path-following model, single-track vehicle model, and magic formula tire model, is constructed. To handle the stability constraints with ease, the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) technique is applied for path-following issue. Here, NMPC control problem is reasonably established with the constraints of vehicle sideslip angle, yaw rate, steering angle, lateral position error, and Lyapunov stability. To mitigate the online calculation burden, the continuation/generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is adopted. The dead-zone penalty functions are employed for handling the inequality constraints and holding the smoothness of solution. Moreover, the varying predictive duration is utilized in this article to gain the good initial solution fast by numerical algorithm. Finally, the simulation validations are carried out, which yields that the proposed strategy can achieve desirable path following and vehicle stability efficacy, while greatly reducing the computational burden compared with the NMPC controllers by active set algorithm or interior point algorithm."

However, autonomous vehicles are not ready for widespread adoption because their safety and security issues are yet to be thoroughly investigated/addressed. Little literature could be found on collaborative analysis of safety and security of autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for analyzing both safety and security issues, which includes an integrated safety and security method (S&S) with international vehicle safety and security standards ISO 26262 and SAE J3061. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated using an example of typical autonomous vehicle model. Using this framework, one can clearly understand the vehicle functions, structure, the associated failures and attacks, and also see the vulnerabilities that are not yet addressed by countermeasures, which helps to improve the in-vehicle safety and security from researching and engineering perspectives."
9140383,VeRA: A Simplified Security Risk Analysis Method for Autonomous Vehicles,"Risk analysis/assessment is an indispensable process during the design and development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which is in charge of evaluating whether the risk of an attack is critical or minor. However, current risk analysis methods either are time-consuming or not suitable for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, an efficient security risk analysis method, Vehicles Risk Analysis (VeRA), is proposed, fitting for evaluating the risks of attacks in the context of AV and CAVs. VeRA firstly considers the human capabilities and vehicle automation level to conduct a security risk analysis. Meanwhile, compared to the benchmark (i.e., SAE J3061), VeRA uses a simplified analysis process and fewer factors, significantly reducing the required analysis time without affecting analysis accuracy. Moreover, based on VeRA, a simple but efficient mathematical model is established to assess the risk value by considering the attack probability, severity and human control, avoiding the tedious process of looking up tables in previous methods. A case study on a general AV model shows that VeRA not only captures the critical attacks as accurate as other methods, but also analyzes the changes of human controllability with the vehicle's automation level. The performance compared to other available methods shows that VeRA can obtain the same analysis results by using around 43% less time than the benchmark."

In this regard, the researchers have worked on developing autonomous vehicles. In this way, the number of collisions have been reduced to a great extent. But their is a need to develop the autonomous simulator which helps to pretest the autonomous vehicles in different road scenarios before launching them in the market. Hence, in this research work, we propose an autonomous simulator which helps to pre-train the autonomous vehicles in the real world. The effectiveness of the simulator has been proved through performing extensive experiments."
9424710,Online Verification Enabling Approval of Driving Functions—Implementation for a Planner of an Autonomous Race Vehicle,"Safety guarantees and regulatory approval for autonomous vehicles remain an ongoing challenge. In particular, software that is frequently adapted or contains complex, non-transparent components, such as artificial intelligence, is exceeding the limits of safety standards. This paper presents a detailed implementation of an online verification module - the Supervisor - that copes with these challenges. The presented implementation focuses on autonomous race vehicles without loss of generality. Following an identified holistic list of safety-relevant requirements for a trajectory, metrics are developed to monitor whether the trajectory can safely be executed. To evaluate safety with respect to dynamic objects in a semi-structured and highly dynamic racing environment, rule-based reachable sets are presented. As a result, the pure reachable set is further constrained by applicable regulations. Real-time capability and effectiveness are demonstrated in fault-injected scenario-based tests and on real-world run data. The implemented Supervisor will be publicly available on GitHub."
8744271,Cognitive Competence Improvement for Autonomous Vehicles: A Lane Change Identification Model for Distant Preceding Vehicles,"The motion status recognition of the preceding vehicle in a long-distance region is a requirement for autonomous vehicles to make appropriate decisions and increase their comprehension of the environment. At present, the lane change behavior of the leading vehicle at a short distance is detected using stereo cameras and LiDAR. However, the short detection distance (about 100 m) does not meet the requirements of high-speed driving of autonomous vehicles on expressways; this is a fundamental problem limiting the development of autonomous vehicles exhibiting human-like behavior. In this paper, a comprehensive model consisting of a back-propagation (BP) neural network model optimized by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and a continuous identification model is developed based on the results of naturalistic on-road experiments using millimeter-wave radar data. By considering different time-to-lane crossings (TLCs), the PSO-BP neural network model is trained using real vehicle lane change data and implemented when the TLC of the leading vehicle is longer than 1.0 s. In contrast, when the TLC is less than 1 s, the continuous recognition model of the TLC is used. By comparison with the BP neural network model, the recognition accuracy rate of the proposed model is increased from 80% to 87% after the PSO optimization for a time window of 1.0 s; these results meet the recognition requirements of the autonomous driving systems for distant targets. The findings of this paper improve the cognitive competence and safety of autonomous driving systems."
9696256,Parallel Vision for Long-Tail Regularization: Initial Results from IVFC Autonomous Driving Testing,"Long-tail effect is characterized by highly frequent occurrence of normal scenarios and the scarce appearance of extreme long-tail scenarios. Though many computer vision methods have already achieved feasible performance for most normal scenarios, it is still challenging for existing systems to accurately perceive the long-tail scenarios, which hinders the practical application of computer vision systems. In this paper, we firstly propose a theoretical framework named Long-tail Regularization (LoTR), for analyzing and tackling the long-tail problems in the vision perception of autonomous driving. Then we present a Parallel Vision Actualization System (PVAS) to search for challenging long-tail scenarios and produce large-scale long-tail driving scenarios for autonomous vehicles. In addition, we introduce how to perform PVAS in Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge of China (IVFC), the most durable autonomous driving competition worldwide. Results over the past decade demonstrate that PVAS can effectively alleviate the impact of long-tail effect."
9341780,The Application of a Flexible Leader-Follower Control Algorithm to Different Mobile Autonomous Robots,"In a wide range of applications involving multiple mobile autonomous systems, maneuvering the robots, vehicles or vessels in some sort of formation is a vital component for the overall task performance. Maintaining a specific distance between the platforms or even a relative geometry may greatly enhance sensor performance, provide collision safety, ensure stable vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and is of critical importance when the systems are in some way physically connected. In this paper, we present a flexible leader-follower type formation control algorithm for autonomous robots which is very simple, generic, yet decent in performance. The method applies to any relative geometry between a leader and one or more followers. In addition to testing the algorithm in simulations for a wide range of scenarios, we have performed experiments involving several different autonomous systems, including small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). This includes pairs of USVs physically interconnected by a tow."
9325924,Impacts of Model Fidelity on Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Vehicles in Extreme Maneuvers,"In this paper, we quantify the impacts of model fidelity on the effectiveness of trajectory optimization for autonomous vehicles when driving at the limits of friction through experiments with a full-size vehicle. Models ranging from a double-track model with lateral and longitudinal load transfer dynamics to a simple point-mass model are used in combination with direct numerical optimization to generate optimal trajectories subject to the limits imposed by each model. The effectiveness of each model for trajectory planning is evaluated by testing the trajectories on an automated vehicle across friction conditions ranging from ice to dry asphalt. Comparisons between the outright performance of the car and the car's ability to track the optimal trajectory are made across the various models. The tests reveal that the advantage of more complex models is less that they better predict the vehicle's behavior, but that they provide a more nuanced view of the vehicle's limits and guidance on the proper coordination of the various actuators on the vehicle in order to make most efficient use of the available tire friction."
9458426,Stochastic modeling and optimization of Electric Vehicle autonomous photovoltaic charging Station,"Electric vehicles (EV) are an environmentally friendly alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles. Despite their environmental benefits, the massive demand for electricity imposed by the expected growth of EVs could affect the safe and economical operation of the electricity grid. For this reason, solar-powered electric vehicle charging stations are viewed as a promising solution for an energy supplement to cope with the increasing number of EVs. In this paper, we consider an autonomous photovoltaic charging station and propose an admission control algorithm and a charging schedule to solve the problem of limited energy storage in the station pack and reduced space in an EV charging station. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed admission and scheduling algorithm outperformed Short Job First (SJF) algorithm. Besides, the introduced algorithm allowed maximizing the performance of the charging station."
9380369,A Scheduling Scheme for Autonomous Vehicle Highway Merging With an Outflow Traffic and Fairness Analysis,"Recently, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication-based scheduling schemes for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on highway on-ramps have received attention because the schemes assign optimal merging times to CAVs based on their criteria, such as first-in first-out order or minimizing CAV total travel time. However, these schemes cause traffic congestion due to the criteria when the vehicle inflow traffic becomes high. To mitigate traffic congestion, a scheduling scheme should assign merging times to CAVs to decrease road vehicle density. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme for autonomous vehicle highway merging with an outflow traffic and fairness analysis. We formulate a multiobjective function that achieves both outflow traffic maximization and fairness in assigned merging times. Since more vehicles pass a highway on-ramp as highway on-ramp outflow traffic increases, the proposed scheme decreases vehicle density on roads by maximizing the outflow traffic. Furthermore, the proposed scheme distributes the vehicle density on both the main and ramp roads by fairly assigning their merging times. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme mitigates the potential traffic congestion of previous scheduling schemes. Furthermore, the proposed scheme improves outflow traffic from highway on-ramps by more than 200 veh/h compared with the previous scheduling schemes."
8730527,Autonomous Planning and Control for Intelligent Vehicles in Traffic,"This paper addresses the trajectory planning problem for autonomous vehicles in traffic. We build a stochastic Markov decision process (MDP) model to represent the behaviors of the vehicles. This MDP model takes into account the road geometry and is able to reproduce more diverse driving styles. We introduce a new concept, namely, the “dynamic cell,” to dynamically modify the state of the traffic according to different vehicle velocities, driver intents (signals), and the sizes of the surrounding vehicles (i.e., truck, sedan, and so on). We then use Bézier curves to plan smooth paths for lane switching. The maximum curvature of the path is enforced via certain design parameters. By designing suitable reward functions, different desired driving styles of the intelligent vehicle can be achieved by solving a reinforcement learning problem. The desired driving behaviors (i.e., autonomous highway overtaking) are demonstrated with an in-house developed traffic simulator."

In order to analyze the feasibility and performance of these applications, it is necessary to build an evaluation platform that jointly considers vehicular communication, road traffic and vehicle dynamics. This article describes our recent progress on network-level autonomous driving simulator based on the Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) protocol, and a joint platform combined with SUMO and CARLA simulators for evaluating road traffic and vehicle dynamics. To demonstrate its effectiveness, this article implements a hybrid multi-intersection scheduling scheme on the platform, and shows the advantages of the scheme in terms of traffic efficiency and fault tolerance.

8951675,Research on Strategy and Algorithm of Lateral Motion Control for Autonomous Driving Electric Vehicle,"Autonomous vehicle motion control system includes two aspects: longitudinal motion control and lateral motion control. This paper studies the lateral motion control strategy and algorithm of the autonomous driving electric vehicles. By analyzing the two indexes of sliding stability and rollover stability, a safety evaluation model of curve driving is established. Based on the above model, the functional relationship between the safe driving speed and curve radius is established by vehicle dynamics software simulation, and the strategy of upper steering control is designed. The control algorithm of the lower layer of lateral movement matching with the upper layer control strategy is studied, which realizes the optimal control of lateral movement deviation. Finally, the real vehicle experiment verifies that the lateral motion control strategy and algorithm designed in this paper can control the steady-state error of lateral displacement within 1.14%, and it has obviously better performance than the traditional Fuzzy controller under straight road and large curvature curve with good real-time, stability and robustness."

In a virtual proving ground, challenging and highly unlikely scenarios can be created and novel control algorithms can be tested with no safety concerns and relatively little cost. A critical component of any virtual proving ground is sensor simulation; i.e., the ability to produce realistic sensor information inside the simulated environment. This paper overviews several models and methods for generating, through simulation, GPS, IMU, and lidar data. While the current models can account for some sensor noise, significant work remains to be done in order to produce simulated data that is realistic and can be used to confidently test and evaluate autonomous agents in virtual proving grounds."
9243094,Persistent Map Saving for Visual Localization for Autonomous Vehicles: An ORB-SLAM 2 Extension,"Electric vhicles and autonomous driving dominate current research efforts in the automotive sector. The two topics go hand in hand in terms of enabling safer and more environmentally friendly driving. One fundamental building block of an autonomous vehicle is the ability to build a map of the environment and localize itself on such a map. In this paper, we make use of a stereo camera sensor in order to perceive the environment and create the map. With live Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), there is a risk of mislocalization, since no ground truth map is used as a reference and errors accumulate over time. Therefore, we first build up and save a map of visual features of the environment at low driving speeds with our extension to the ORB-SLAM 2 package. In a second run, we reload the map and then localize on the previously built-up map. Loading and localizing on a previously built map can improve the continuous localization accuracy for autonomous vehicles in comparison to a full SLAM. This map saving feature is missing in the original ORB-SLAM 2 implementation. We evaluate the localization accuracy for scenes of the KITTI dataset against the built up SLAM map. Furthermore, we test the localization on data recorded with our own small scale electric model car. We show that the relative translation error of the localization stays under 1% for a vehicle travelling at an average longitudinal speed of 36 m/s in a feature-rich environment. The localization mode contributes to a better localization accuracy and lower computational load compared to a full SLAM. The source code of our contribution to the ORB-SLAM2 will be made public at: https://github.com/TUMFTM/orbslam-map-saving-extension."
9445111,Adaptive Sampling of Surface Fronts in the Arctic Using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"Fronts between Arctic- and Atlantic-origin waters are characterized by strong lateral gradients in temperature and salinity. Ocean processes associated with fronts are complex with considerable space and time variability. Therefore, resolving the processes in frontal zones by observation is challenging but important for understanding the associated physical–biological interactions and their impact on the marine ecosystem. The use of autonomous robotic vehicles and in situ data-driven sampling can help improve and augment the traditional sampling practices, such as ships and profiling instruments. Here, we present the development and results of using an autonomous agent for detection and sampling of an Arctic front, integrated on board an autonomous underwater vehicle. The agent is based on a subsumption architecture implemented as behaviors in a finite-state machine. Once a front is detected, the front tracking behavior uses observations to continuously adapt the path of the vehicle to perform transects across the front interface. Following successful sea trials in the Trondheimsfjord, the front-tracking agent was deployed to perform a full-scale mission near 82
∘
N north of Svalbard, close to the sea ice edge. The agent was able to detect and track an Arctic frontal feature, performing a total of six crossings while collecting vertical profiles in the upper 90 m of the water column. Measurements yield a detailed volumetric description of the frontal feature with high resolution along the frontal zone, augmenting ship-based sampling that was run in parallel."

The key elements of the proposed method include a novel vehicle pairing framework that represents vehicles based on the fused sensor contexts and vehicle taillights. These detected vehicles are then tracked in real-time night time traffic videos. Experiments are conducted on real traffic videos and the proposed system attains 0.6319 in multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), which represents a 26.1% increase compared with the baseline performance."
9447388,Determining the number of collection points for autonomous vehicle-based service using gravity model,"Autonomous vehicles contribute to the development of on-demand mobility services for commuters in a metropolitan area. The aim of our research is to develop a method of determining the number of collection points for a shared autonomous vehicle-based mobility service. In the service, microcars are used to serve the demands. However, only the first and last kilometers of a trip are done by the microcars; they are transported together on a trailer for common route sections. The boarding and alighting of microcars are managed in collection points. The collection point number determination method is based on Newton's model of gravity; variables about territorial and commuting aspects were considered (e.g., distance, public transportation availability, population, job opportunities, modal share, willingness to change). The method was applied to a certain part of the Budapest metropolitan area as a case study. The results contribute to the introduction of autonomous vehicle-based mobility services."
9355724,DASH: A Universal Intersection Traffic Management System for Autonomous Vehicles,"Waiting in a long queue at a traffic light has been a common and frustrating experience of the majority of daily commuters, which not only wastes valuable time but also pollutes our environments. With the advances in autonomous vehicles and their collaboration capabilities, the previous jamming intersection has a great potential to be turned into weaving traffic flows that no longer need to stop. Towards this envision, we propose a novel autonomous vehicle traffic coordination system called DASH. Specifically, DASH has a comprehensive model to represent intersections and vehicle status. It can constantly process a large volume of vehicle information of various kinds, resolve scheduling conflicts of all vehicles coming towards the intersection, and generate the optimal travel plan for each individual vehicle in real time to guide vehicles passing intersections in a safe and highly efficient way. Unlike existing works on the autonomous traffic control which are limited to certain types of intersections and lack considerations of practicability, our proposed DASH algorithm is universal for any kind of intersections yields the near-maximum throughput while still ensuring riding comfort that prevents sudden stop and acceleration. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the DASH system in the scenarios of different types of intersections and different traffic flows. Our experimental results demonstrate its practicality, effectiveness, and efficiency."
9159671,Assignment of Legal Responsibilities for Decisions by Autonomous Cars Using System Architectures,"Increasing automation in road vehicles moves decision making from humans to algorithms. This gives a lack of clarity in assigning responsibility for the consequences of the resultant actions, presenting problems for ethicists, lawyers, and engineers. This article applies proven methods based on the 4D/RCS reference model architecture to derive proposed architectures for autonomous vehicles with J3016 autonomy levels 2-5. The architectures have a hierarchy of nodes, which can be either a human or an automated process, giving unambiguous allocation of authority to act and consequent responsibilities to individual nodes in the system. A concept called authorized power is introduced for every node, giving clear limits on each node's ability to act. Setting node requirements gives a firm basis for engineers and lawyers to agree where responsibilities lie, whether with the user, owner, or in the supply chain. It also provides a framework to assess engineering risk and the wider financial implications of the new technologies as they are introduced."
9573893,Propulsive Performance of Tandem Flapping Wings for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (Auvs) and Surface Ships,"The application of tandem flapping foils propulsors to conventional aerial and underwater vehicles plays a most important role in the exploration of aerial and marine environments. The hydrodynamic study of fish schooling or birds flock when swimming/flying in fluid media and the application towards development of tandem flapping wing robots gaining more importance in the field of bioinspired vehicles. The advantages of tandem flapping wing configuration are improved thrust performance; maneuvering and less energy input as the downstream foils consumes less power compared to the single flapping foils. In thist study, the thrust of two flapping foils arranged in tandem mode subjected to pitching motion with different pitching amplitudes(A D ), Strouhal numbers (St D ), stream wise distance (S/c) and phase-lag ( \varphi
) of foils are studied numerically using RANSE based CFD solver. This novel study mainly investigates the effects of Strouhal number and the dimensionless pitching amplitude on the thrust and efficiency of tandem foils. It is observed that the tandem foils generate higher efficiency at \text{St}_{\mathrm{D}}=0.2
and \mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{D}}= 0.7
. At this condition, the effects of stream wise distance and phase-lag of tandem foils are also investigated. When \varphi
is constant and S/c changes from 0.109 to 1, the efficiency of the upstream foil decreases and the efficiency of downstream foil increases. When S/c is constant and \varphi
changes from 0° to 180°, upstream foil efficiency increases and downstream foil efficiency decreases with increase in phase-lag. When \varphi
is 90°, total efficiency of the two foils gets the maximum value. In general, when S/c is 1 and \varphi
is 90°, the tandem flapping foils get the maximum propulsive efficiency. For achieving this condition, pitching amplitude, frequency and increased phase lag between the two foils plays a significant role compared to the stream wise distance(S/c) between th...

9340902,Autonomous Vehicle Benchmarking using Unbiased Metrics,"With the recent development of autonomous vehicle technology, there have been active efforts on the deployment of this technology at different scales that include urban and highway driving. While many of the prototypes showcased have been shown to operate under specific cases, little effort has been made to better understand their shortcomings and generalizability to new areas. Distance, uptime and number of manual disengagements performed during autonomous driving provide a high-level idea on the performance of an autonomous system but without proper data normalization, testing location information, and the number of vehicles involved in testing, the disengagement reports alone do not fully encompass system performance and robustness. Thus, in this study a complete set of metrics are applied for benchmarking autonomous vehicle systems in a variety of scenarios that can be extended for comparison with human drivers and other autonomous vehicle systems. These metrics have been used to benchmark UC San Diego's autonomous vehicle platforms during early deployments for micro-transit and autonomous mail delivery applications."
9466157,A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Suitable for Autonomous Vehicles: Double Bootstrapped Soft-Actor-Critic-Discrete,"With the rapid advancement of modern society, autonomous systems have been broadly applied in people’s daily lives. Under the guidance of this trend, autonomous vehicles have gradually become popular. However, due to some adverse factors(such as insufficient computing force and limited communication bandwidth) in edge computing scenarios and the lack of autonomous decision-making ability, the safety of autonomous vehicles is not enough. It is a good solution to use a deep reinforcement learning(DRL) algorithm, which combines deep learning(DL) and reinforcement learning(RL), to provide a fast convergence speed and an appropriate decision-making ability. In this paper, based on Soft-Actor-Critic(SAC) and Soft-Actor-Critic-Discrete(SAC-D), we propose a Double Bootstrapped Soft-Actor-Critic-Discrete(DBSAC-D) algorithm. By introducing bootstrap, the ability to explore in action space is enhanced, the value of each action is accurately judged, the convergence process is accelerated and the consumption of the computing force is reduced. In addition, we also propose a novel sampling strategy, which balances the novelty and importance of the sampled data, and improves the training value of the sampled data to the network model. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves good performances in several traffic scenes and has a fast convergence speed."
9393874,Advancing Autonomous Surface Vehicles: A 3D Perception System for the Recognition and Assessment of Docking-Based Structures,"The automation of typically intelligent and decision-making processes in the maritime industry leads to fewer accidents and more cost-effective operations. However, there are still lots of challenges to solve until fully autonomous systems can be employed. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a major role in this paradigm shift and shows great potential for solving some of these challenges, such as the docking process of an autonomous vessel. This work proposes a lightweight volumetric Convolutional Neural Network (vCNN) capable of recognizing different docking-based structures using 3D data in real-time. A synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approach is also proposed to accelerate the training process of the vCNN. This approach makes it possible to greatly decrease the cost of data acquisition and the need for advanced computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate an accuracy of over 90% in the recognition of different docking structures, using low resolution sensors. The inference time of the system was about 120ms on average. Results obtained using a real Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) demonstrated that the vCNN trained with the synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approach is suitable for maritime mobile robots. This novel AI recognition method, combined with the utilization of 3D data, contributes to an increased robustness of the docking process regarding environmental constraints, such as rain and fog, as well as insufficient lighting in nighttime operations."
9661190,Evaluate the Connected Autonomous Vehicles Infrastructure using Digital Twin Model Based on Cyber-Physical Combination of Intelligent Network,"With the increment of connected vehicles, the level of intelligence becomes more and more irregular, so the difficulties of determining the dynamic safety of self-driving in mixed-transport flow have increased significantly. To solve the problems such as reliability, human-car-road perception, decision making, and control coordination assessment in an intelligent networked environment, this article established a multi-source dynamic game model to carry out the measurement of autonomous vehicle dynamics model, control estimation, decision strategy, forward and backward safety mechanism, and planning of mixed-traffic flow route. The digital twin has real-time, synchronous evolution, and interactivity with a semi-physical environment and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) model to control the accuracy of dynamic safety decisions for smart connected vehicles. This all process developed by combining with vehicle-to-everything (as a physical entity) and smart simulation test technology (as a virtual entity), which understands the compound and dynamic safety decision objects such as multi-agent view, multi-source data communication, vehicle switching, V2V transmission, and V2R synchronization for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in the mixed-traffic flow atmospheres."
8996324,Alterable channelization intersection coordinating method for connected and autonomous vehicles,"An alterable channelization intersection real-time coordinating method for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is proposed in this paper. Links connected with the intersection are divided into three areas: approaching area, lane changing area and speed adjusting area. A double first-conflicting-time (FCT) loop is introduced to form the parallel slots, calculate the target status of the vehicles and keep the performance of the proposed method in heavy traffic. A safe headway criterion is applied to guarantee the safety of the vehicles in the condition of position error and communication delay exist. Acceleration dynamically adjusting based on predicted trajectory (ADAPT) method is proposed to guide the vehicle to reach the target status. A simulation environment of 4-direction intersection with 3-lane of each link, is established to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the method can reduce average vehicle delay to 10s with input under 1350 veh/h per link. For coordinating heavy traffic, the vehicle delay rises but the performance of the coordinating method would not degrade. The proposed method can coordinate disequilibrium traffic by automatically and consecutively assigning parallel slots for each coming vehicle, and shows the superiority than traditional intersection control strategies."

The motion dynamics of an AUV are coupled and nonlinear, which makes the design of a control law a challenging task. In this work, a nonlinear dynamic model of the underwater vehicle is discussed. The paper further proposes the design of a sliding mode control for the heading and diving plane manoeuvres of AUV. The stability of the designed controller is validated through simulation using a dynamic and kinematic model developed. The dynamic model and control policy proposed in this work is generic and thus not restricted to any particular underwater vehicle."
9494111,Terrain-Aided Navigation With Coarse Maps—Toward an Arctic Crossing With an AUV,"The desire to conduct research in the Arctic on an ever-larger spatiotemporal scale has led to the development of long-range autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), such as the Autosub Long-Range 1500 (ALR1500). While these platforms open up a world of new applications, their actual use is limited in GPS-denied environments since self-contained navigation remains yet unavailable. In response, this study evaluates whether terrain-aided navigation (TAN) can enable multimonth deployments using basic navigation sensors and sparse bathymetric maps. To evaluate the potential, ALR1500 undertakes a hypothetical science-driven mission from Svalbard (Norway) to Point Barrow (Alaska, USA) under the sea ice (a mission over 3200 km). Therefore, a simulated environment is developed, which integrates a state-of-the-art model of water circulation, error models for heading estimation at high latitudes, and an Arctic bathymetric map. Recognizing that this map is constructed based on sparse depth measurements and interpolation techniques, a bathymetric uncertainty model is developed. The performance of the TAN algorithm is examined with respect to the type of the heading sensor utilized and a range of vertical map distortions, calculated using the developed bathymetric uncertainty model. Simulations show that unaided navigation experiences an error of hundreds of kilometers, whereas TAN provides acceptable accuracy given a moderate map distortion. By degrading the quality of the map further, it appears that the navigation filter may diverge when traversing large regions subject to interpolation. Therefore, a rapidly-exploring random tree star algorithm is used to design a new path such that the AUV traverses reliable and rich in topographic information areas."
9021985,On Control Transitions in Autonomous Driving: A Framework and Analysis for Characterizing Scene Complexity,"'Take-overs' are safety critical events in conditionally autonomous vehicles. These are cases where vehicle control is transferred from the autonomous system to a human driver during failure modes of the system. Safe take-overs depend on two key factors; the readiness of the driver, and the complexity of the scene. While prior work has addressed driver readiness estimation, scene complexity estimation for control transitions remains an unexplored topic. In this paper, we focus on characterizing the complexity of driving scenes as perceived by human drivers during takeover events. To this end, we collect naturalistic driving data using a conditionally autonomous vehicle, equipped with cameras and LiDAR sensors. We mine a diverse set of scenarios using the LiDAR point cloud statistics. We then collect take-over complexity ratings in these scenarios assigned by raters with varying degrees of driving experience. We present an analysis of inter-rater agreement, and the average rated complexity conditioned on features of the surrounding environment, detected agents around the ego-vehicle, and ego-vehicle actions and motion states."
8845649,An Autonomous T-Intersection Driving Strategy Considering Oncoming Vehicles Based on Connected Vehicle Technology,"Autonomous driving strategies for intersection scenarios are challenging due to the varying traffic conditions of oncoming vehicles. Based on the connected vehicle technology, this article proposes an autonomous T-intersection driving strategy considering the oncoming vehicles for motion-planning and path following. A finite-state machine (FSM) is developed in the motion planner to decide the driving strategies considering the oncoming vehicles. Information pieces from the connected vehicle, specifically vehicle position and speed, are selected and effectively utilized to construct the temporal windows that manage the driving states transition of the FSM. Speed profiles in different driving states are modified for collision avoidance. Then, a path-following controller based on the back-stepping method is designed to track the planned path and speed simultaneously. The proposed strategy is validated by both simulation and experimental investigations. The results show the controlled vehicle can safely and quickly pass through the intersection using the proposed driving strategy that avoids possible collisions with the oncoming vehicles."

Conventional LiDAR sensors have the demerit of consuming constant power depending on the normal operation. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that improves the inefficient power consumption during the normal operation of a conventional LiDAR sensor. The LiDAR sensor with the applied algorithm provides efficient power saving by controlling resolution through a variable transmission period of a laser diode (LD) depending on the vehicle speed and the surrounding environment."

However, we need an effective scheme that encourages drivers to share state information voluntarily while driving because the information can be shared only by their permission. Therefore, this paper proposes an incentive scheme to boost information sharing and hence improve autonomous driving safety."
9405416,A Human-Like Model to Understand Surrounding Vehicles’ Lane Changing Intentions for Autonomous Driving,"Autonomous vehicles have to share the road with human-driven ones for a prolonged period in the near future. Thus, they should have the ability to understand the lane changing intentions of surrounding human-driven vehicles. Unlike human drivers, the state-of-the-art models used in autonomous vehicles recognize a driver's lane changing intention based on the target vehicle's lateral movement, which leaves little to no time for the autonomous vehicle to react. In this paper, a Human-like Lane Changing Intention Understanding Model (HLCIUM) for autonomous driving is proposed to understand the lane changing intentions of surrounding vehicles. By imitating the selective attention mechanism of human vision systems, the proposed model emulates the way human drivers concentrate on the surrounding vehicles and recognizes their lane changing intentions accordingly. The velocity changes of the surrounding vehicles are treated as the lane changing hints, and the attention is drawn to the corresponding vehicle following a saliency-based scheme. Then, the lane changing intention is identified by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based intention recognizer. The proposed model is tested with Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) vehicle trajectory dataset, and the proposed method has reached 90.89% in detecting lane changing intention and 88.58% in lane keeping in urban road scenarios, and reached 87.73% and 87.48% for the lane changing and lane keeping intentions in highway scenarios, respectively. Importantly, the average recognition time before the lane changing maneuver of the proposed model is 6.67 seconds for the urban road datasets and 7.08 seconds for the highway datasets, which is far earlier than state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the proposed method shows efficiency and robustness in complex real urban traffic datasets, which is ideal to use in human-like autonomous driving systems."
8936029,Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle in Presence of Moving Obstacle Based on Three Inputs Fuzzy Logic,"This paper concentrated on the path planning for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to avoid collisions with the moving obstacles. Considering the influence of moving speed of the obstacles on control effect, a 3-inputs fuzzy controller is designed, in which the change of the distance between the AUV and the obstacle is taken as one of the inputs. Simulation results show that the controller can avoid the slow moving obstacles in the same direction in front of the AUV, and also successfully avoid the obstacles moving towards the AUV. And it also shows that when the obstacle moves faster, the 3-inputs controller is obviously more effective than the commonly used 2-inputs controller."
9071866,Tracking Control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle: Higher-Order Sliding Mode Control Approach,"Tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is complicated due to highly nonlinear dynamics, structural and non-structural uncertainties, and inevitable external disturbances. In this study, the control algorithm for tracking operation of AUV in 3D workspace is proposed. This algorithm is based on terminal sliding mode control technique, which leads to fast response, time-limited convergence and robustness against uncertainties and external disturbances. To this end, first the trajectory planning and convergence of position tracking errors is introduced using kinematics model. Next, control laws are developed and the stability of the proposed control lows are analyzed. Finally, the system performance using various control laws of terminal sliding mode tracking control (TSMTC), fast terminal sliding mode tracking control (FTSMTC) and feedback linearizing tracking control (FLTC) are compared. Obtained results show efficiency of the proposed FTSMTC algorithm in accelerating route tracking and reasonable performance in handling disturbances in terms of tracking errors."
9213413,Actuator Fault Detection for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Using Interval Observer,"A new actuator fault detection method for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was proposed in this paper, based on interval observer. Firstly, the nonlinear vertical motion model of AUV is simplified and a linear time invariant (LTI) system is obtained. For this LTI system, interval observer is projected and it has two parts: one for the estimate of the upper bound of the states and the other for the estimate of the lower bound of the states. Using the information from interval observer, residual and threshold are generated simultaneously, which is quite different from the conventional method where the generation of residual and the choice of threshold are separated. Hence the proposed method provides a more simple realization of actuator fault detection. In the end, the availability of the presented method are conducted to verity by simulations."
9018207,Formation Control of Multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Under Communication Delays,"Time-delay owing to the communication delay in acoustic modem greatly influences the path following performances when a group of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are deployed in formation. When the AUVs are employed in oceanic environment, the distance between the AUVs keeps on changing due to wave disturbances. Hence, time-delay which depends on the distance between AUVs also varies. In this brief, a time-delay estimator based on gradient-descent method has been designed to estimate the communication delays. Taking the estimated delay into account, the delayed error vectors are computed to design a suitable control input. As the reduction of Lyapunov function incorporating communication delay occurs on-line at each sampling interval, the path following control performance of follower AUV improves significantly. The simulation and experimental results show that the delay estimator accurately estimates the delay. Moreover, during experiment, the actual delay is significantly reduced as the time-stamping of packets of leader AUV states is avoided during formulation of the estimator. The follower AUV even under the effects of variable communication delay, maintains a desired distance from the leader AUV. The results also show that by imposing constraints on the control input, actuator saturation is avoided."

The inducible factors of road traffic accidents include weak road infrastructure, imperfect legal system, vehicle failure and improper driver operation, etc. Among them, improper operation of drivers is the primary cause of major and malignant road traffic accidents, so improving the quality of driving behavior is the key to curb the situation of frequent traffic accidents [6]. And this also puts forward higher requests for autonomous driving technology. This paper mainly studies the optimal project of complex constraints for autonomous vehicles.

MPC has the ability to systematically consider nonlinearity, future predictions and operating constraints of the control system framework. One problem for autonomous vehicles operating on toll roads must be able to do a satisfactory tracking path when avoiding obstacles so that accidents do not occur. This paper will discuss designing tracking path controllers using a predictive controller (MPC) model based on scenario avoidance obstacle on the highway with several variations in speed. The trajectory has been predetermined and the controller must be able to autonomously avoid static obstacles on the road and can track the desired trajectory by controlling the front steering angle of the vehicle. This approach discusses solving a single nonlinear MPC problem for following trajectories and avoiding static obstacle. The vehicle model was developed based on 3 DOF non-linear vehicle model. This controller model was developed based on X, Y global position and yaw rate to get input in the form of steering to the vehicle dynamic system. For path tracking strategy, comparisons with the Stanley controller are done to analyse MPC reliability as nonlinear controller in low and middle speed scenario. Simulation results show that the MPC controller has the advantage of a tracking path that is good at mid and high speeds."

9205782,Model Predictive Control with Laguerre Function based on Social Ski Driver Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicle,"The steering control of the autonomous vehicles represents an avital issue in the vehicular system. The model predictive control was proved as an effective controller. However, the representation of the model predictive control (MPC) by a large prediction horizon and control horizon requires a large number of parameters and it is complicated. Discrete-time Laguerre functions can cope with this issue to represent the MPC with few parameters. Whilst, the Laguerre functions require a proper tuning for its parameters in order to provide a good response with MPC. This paper introduces a new design method to tune the parameters of the MPC with the Laguerre function by a new artificial intelligence (AI) technique named social ski driver algorithm (SSDA). The proposed MPC based on the SSDA is applied to adjust the steering angle of an autonomous vehicle including vision dynamics. Further test scenarios are created to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed control to cope with the variations of road curvatures."
8643096,A Motion Planning and Tracking Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Based on Artificial Potential Field Elaborated Resistance Network Approach,"This paper presents a novel motion planning and tracking framework for automated vehicles based on artificial potential field (APF) elaborated resistance approach. Motion planning is one of the key parts of autonomous driving, which plans a sequence of movement states to help vehicles drive safely, comfortably, economically, human-like, etc. In this paper, the APF method is used to assign different potential functions to different obstacles and road boundaries; while the drivable area is meshed and assigned resistance values in each edge based on the potential functions. A local current comparison method is employed to find a collision-free path. As opposed to a path, the vehicle motion or trajectory should be planned spatiotemporally. Therefore, the entire planning process is divided into two spaces, namely the virtual and actual. In the virtual space, the vehicle trajectory is predicted and executed step by step over a short horizon with the current vehicle speed. Then, the predicted trajectory is evaluated to decide if the speed should be kept or changed. Finally, it will be sent to the actual space, where an experimentally validated Carsim model controlled by a model predictive controller is used to track the planned trajectory. Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

Dealing with a diversified set of use cases, ranging from manoeuvrer negotiation to infotainment, autonomous and connected vehicles call for a radically new approach to mobile networking. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and network slicing have emerged to address such a challenge. The former, MEC, allows offloading computationally intensive tasks to nodes located very close to the vehicles. Slicing, in turn, allows instantiating multiple virtual networks, each of them tailored to meet the requirements of a specific service class, e.g. low latency, on top of the same infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce a novel design for a 5G network for autonomous and connected vehicles combining MEC and network slicing. The resulting solution allows features like lane tracking and object detection to be safely offloaded to the 5G network without impairing their effectiveness."
9457136,Joint Optimization and Online Algorithms of Fuel-Aware Multi-Objective Routing for Autonomous Vehicles,"It is extremely important for autonomous vehicles to automatically complete refueling and various other tasks. However, most of the existing approaches are only suitable for conventional vehicles with large fuel tank, while the routing performance degrades, especially for electric vehicles and aerial vehicles that are constrained by small fuel capacity. This paper proposes a fuel-aware routing framework for autonomous vehicle that is employed for uninterruptedly visiting targets in logistics industry. By decoupling the topology representation and optimization process, the framework can express various optimization objectives, such as fuel consumption, trip delay and refueling cost, in a consistent way. For the fixed-path refueling problem, we propose an iterative method to improve the routing efficiency by minimizing unnecessary fuel reservation and design an efficient online solution to make trade off between routing efficiency and computation complexity. For the tour refueling problem, we propose a two-stage approach, which can simplify the routing calculation based on the solution to the fixed-path refueling problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the alternative approaches in terms of both routing efficiency and computation complexity, while supporting for joint optimization of multiple objectives."

For autonomously controlled vehicles driving safely in complex and dynamic traffic scenarios, it is essential to precisely predict the evolution of the current traffic situation in the near future and make an accurate situational risk assessment. The precise motion prediction of surrounding vehicles is an essential prerequisite for risk assessment and motion planning of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a risk assessment and motion planning method for autonomously controlled vehicles based on motion prediction of surrounding vehicles. Firstly, surrounding vehicles' trajectories are predicted based on fusing constant turn rate and acceleration-based motion prediction model and maneuver-based motion prediction model with interactive multiple models. Then, considering both the probability of collision event and collision severity, the collision risk assessment between autonomously controlled vehicle and surrounding vehicles is conducted with a collision risk index. After that, the motion planning of the autonomously controlled vehicle is formulated as a multi-objectives and multi-constraints optimization problem with a model predictive control framework. Finally, the proposed method is applied to several traffic scenarios to validate its feasibility and effectiveness."

Exploiting the full width allows new path planning options while using the existing road infrastructure. This research focuses on trajectory planning and control for fully autonomous vehicles without considering the lane marks. In this paper, a controller is designed using the nonlinear Model Predictive Control approach for the movements of autonomous vehicles group on roads without lanes. After ensuring that the vehicles avoid collisions, the controller generates the desired longitudinal acceleration and steering rate inputs. The goal is to maximize vehicles' progress on the road with minimum control efforts, where the constraints are the road geometry layouts and vehicle dynamics. The proposed controller was tested on three case study simulations for several vehicles to examine the advantages of the lane-free road concept for path and trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles."

In this paper, a new vehicle pose estimation method based on Edge Distance is proposed. The Edge Distance is defined to describe the distribution of point clouds with respect to their bounding rectangles. Based on the Edge Distance, a bounding rectangle of the point clouds is utilized to fit the vehicle outline. For the case where the point clouds are sparse or only one edge is visible, the bounding rectangle is modified according to preset vehicle size. The pose estimation of the vehicle is obtained based on the bounding rectangle. Experiments based on the KITTI data sets show that the proposed method can obtain better performance in vehicle pose estimation compared with the method based on modified scaling series."

This helps enhance their awareness of the imminent hazards. However, conventional behavior prediction solutions are applicable in simple driving scenarios that require short prediction horizons. Most recently, deep learning-based approaches have become popular due to their promising performance in more complex environments compared to the conventional approaches. Motivated by this increased popularity, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of deep learning-based approaches for vehicle behavior prediction in this article. We firstly give an overview of the generic problem of vehicle behavior prediction and discuss its challenges, followed by classification and review of the most recent deep learning-based solutions based on three criteria: input representation, output type, and prediction method.

Unlike a modern rule-based method, this study has been supervised on the manipulate of images end-to-end, which is deep learning. The motivation of this paper where the input to the model is the camera image and the output is the steering angle target. The model trained a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) convolutional neural network(CNN) algorithm to drive an autonomous vehicle in the simulator. Therefore, the model trained and simulation are conducted using the UDACITY platform. The simulator has two choices one is the training and the second one is autonomous. The autonomous has two tracks track _1 considered as simple and track _2 complex as compare to track_1. In our paper, we used track_1 for autonomous driving in the simulator.

9520239,A Reputation-based Leader Election Scheme for Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"As an emerging concept in the intelligent transportation system (ITS), Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (OAVP) enables autonomous vehicles to self-organize a temporary platoon and travel together. Whereas, electing the platoon leader is a crucial issue to be solved in this scenario. The platoon leader not only suffers from more wind resistance but also spends more computation resources in dealing with tremendous information obtained from the surrounding environment. Hence, vehicles tend to be a follower rather than a leader. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based leader election system for OAVP named RLE, which contains two sub-systems: leader election and incentive mechanism. In the former one, a reputation-based election scheme is first constructed to elect a relatively trustful leader according to the reputation value recorded on the blockchain. The proposed scheme integrates previous experience with recommendations from other members. In the second sub-system, an incentive mechanism is designed to stimulate platoon members to participate actively in the process of election, which is based on the recorded real-time fuel economy among vehicles participating in a platoon. Security analysis shows that the system is sufficient to deal with potential security threats. Experimental results based on the simulated platform demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of our solution."

Gathering sensor data from multi-autonomous vehicles is a promising method to enhance the sensing coverage and accuracy. However, there exists few communication scheme for cooperating the sensing and computation capacities of autonomous vehicles and organize them into a platoon to maintain a safe driving. In this paper, we propose a communication scheme for autonomous vehicles platoon. In this communication scheme, autonomous vehicles in an adjacent area are organized as a cooperative sensing platoon. Meanwhile a head vehicle is selected to schedule the offloading of sensor data. Two different situations are take into considered which depend whether the autonomous vehicles are assisted by a Road Side Unit(RSU).

8908660,Smart Longitudinal Velocity Control of Autonomous Vehicles in Interactions With Distracted Human-Driven Vehicles,"With the development of commercialized autonomous vehicles (AVs), the interaction between AVs and human-driven vehicles has become increasingly important. Nevertheless, on the one hand, complex driver behaviors like distraction are hard to detect by AVs, which may lead to traffic accidents because of the late alert to the following vehicles. On the other hand, advanced techniques such as the real-time image or video processing and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications make it possible to let AVs receive monitoring signals from nearby vehicles, predict the latent risks, and make smart control to avoid the vehicles driven by distracted drivers. Hence, in this paper, we envisage a collaborative framework integrating human driver distraction monitoring, V2V communications, and AV velocity control. Then, we design the smart velocity control of AVs by taking into consideration the distraction behaviors of the drivers in the human-driven vehicles, and by formulating it as a feasible optimization problem based on model predictive control (MPC) strategies. Furthermore, we analyze the safety benefits that the collaborative framework could help improve on the condition of preserving traffic performance. Finally, we implement the contrast tests of real-time evaluation on driver distraction monitoring based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and perform simulations of smart velocity control strategies of the AV at avoiding the distracted driver and reducing rear-end collisions. Through the analysis and the simulations, we show our framework could increase the safety regions, reduce the rear-end collisions, and thus increase the safety of the whole transportation networks."

9274882,Integrated Design of Local Trajectory Planning and Tracking Control for Autonomous Driving,"This paper describes a real-time local trajectory planning and tracking control algorithm, based on the constrained optimization framework, applicable to autonomous vehicles operating in unstructured environment. The primary novelty is in use of closed-loop information prediction along the given global path in the framework of trajectory planning, i.e. reference velocities and trajectory points used in trajectory planning are generated by low-level tracking control. A continuous-curvature path-smoothing algorithm based on parametric cubic Bezier curves is firstly adopted to smooth the given global path, presented by an ordered sequence of waypoints. An obstacle-free dynamic-feasible trajectory planning problem is carefully formulated by a sequential convex optimization procedure. The solution trajectory points are used for feed-forward and feed-back tracking control. The proposed algorithm was at the core of the planning and control modules for an eight-wheel independent drive vehicle, which demonstrated the obstacle-avoidance ability in a task-based offroad autonomous driving test."
8969453,Localization in Autonomous Vehicles Using a Generalized Inner Product,"Fine localization in autonomous driving platforms is a task of broad interest, receiving much attention in recent years. Some localization algorithms use the Euclidean distance as a similarity measure between the local image acquired by a camera and a global map, which acts as side information. The global map is typically expressed in terms of the coordinate system of the road plane. Yet, a road image captured by a camera is subject to distortion in that nearby features on the road have much larger footprints on the focal plane of the camera compared with those of equally-sized features that lie farther ahead of the vehicle. Using commodity computational tools, it is straightforward to execute a transformation and, thereby, bring the distorted image into the frame of reference of the global map. However, this nonlinear transformation results in unequal noise amplification. The noise profile induced by this transformation should be accounted for when trying to match an acquired image to a global map, with more reliable regions being given more weight in the process. This physical reality presents an algorithmic opportunity to improve existing localization algorithms, especially in harsh conditions. This article reviews the physics of road feature acquisition through a camera, and it proposes an improved matching method rooted in statistical analysis. Findings are supported by numerical simulations."

Netherthless, how to test autonomous vehicles thoroughly in a safe and comprehensive manner remains a major challenge. To achieve safer and more effective autonomous driving testing, this paper proposes a novel mixed test environment-based validation method with vehicle in the loop(ViL) : (1) our method supports more realistic drive safety tests in mixed scenarios which integrate the synthetic and the real-world scenarios. Synthetic scenarios offer complex traffic simulation with diverse road conditions. The real-world scenarios introduce the real autonomous driving vehicle, the real sensor suite as well as the test field to the test loop, having further bridged the gap between Hardware-in-the-Loop(HiL) testing and real road tests than ViL; (2) virtual perceptional results are simulated directly and delivered to the real vehicle in Unified Fusion Data Format(UFDF), without rendering virtual detection data for reduced resource consumption; (3) diverse test scenarios are configurable and reproducible with OSM-based High Definition(HD) map, enabling the simulation to be decoupled from a specific test filed or traffic facilities. A series of experiments on the application of our method have been demonstrated, and our approach is proved to be a promising drive safety testing technique before actual road testing."
8893110,Autonomous vehicles' safety in mixed traffic: Accounting for incoming vehicles when overtaking,"The author builds on his previous work on formalization the traffic rules, to keep the autonomous vehicles (AV) legally accountable when planning and performing different maneuvers, employing a methodology based on Legal, Logic and Engineering Analyses to assess the safety of overtaking in mixed traffic. As the overtaking models were developed by now only for setups like Operational Designed Domain which is a controlled, known in advance environment, or for simplified scenarios as overtaking on highways with traffic separated by medians, the present paper developed a model able to account for the incoming traffic when overtaking, extending the applicability range from highways to the complex situation of urban streets or rural roads, two-ways and undivided traffic. Aiming to facilitate the translation of formulas expressed in Linear Temporal Logic to High Order Logic Languages, a series of definitions and theorems were developed, variables as time/distance-to-collision and time/distance-for-overtaking calculated, and finally the predicates as safe-distance-incoming, avoid-head-on-collision or safe-lateral-distance were assessed. The model fills another literature gap as well, by introducing variable speeds and acceleration during overtaking. Three control strategies emerged from these model's control functions: Passive, Reactive and Pro-active Control Strategies able, for different condition and extents to safely trade-off with the kinematics' variation detected at incoming vehicles, and to timely trigger the appropriate countermeasure packages of AV."
8935978,The Implementation of Remote Monitoring for Autonomous Driving,"Although autonomous driving offers the possibility of significant benefits to social welfare, fully automated vehicles might not be going to happen in the near further. Currently, the self-driving vehicle, (e.g., shuttle bus) has to be monitored from a remote control center and the large amounts of data, including images, radar and LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data, etc., have to be transmitted from the vehicle to the remote center. Therefore, this paper proposes a compression method for LIDAR data. Firstly, the time-series LIDAR data are rearranged into azimuth-altitude two-dimensional signal spaces. Secondly, the two-dimensional data are transferred into frequency domain by using the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Thirdly, the time-series DCT data are sampled based on differential sampling. Finally, the whole set of data are encoded using Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-algorithm (LZMA). Meanwhile, this paper also presents the remote control of autonomous vehicles. The videos are streamed from the vehicle while the control commands are issued through a gamepad. Field trials show that the amount of LIDAR data can be reduced dozens of times, while the remote control is feasible at a vehicle speed of 20kph."
9267895,Autonomous Detection of the Loss of a Wing for Underwater Gliders,"Over the past five years, two of the Slocum underwater gliders operated by the UK National Oceanography Centre have lost a wing mid-mission without the pilot being aware of the problem until the point of vehicle retrieval. In this study, the steady-state data collected by gliders during the two deployments has been analysed to develop a fault detection system. From the data analysis, it is clear that the loss of the wing was a sudden event for both gliders. The main changes to the system dynamics associated with the event are an increase in the positive buoyancy of the glider and the occurrence of a roll angle on the side of the lost wing, with significant difference between dives and climbs. Hence, a simple effective system for the detection of the wing loss has been designed using the roll angle. Since sensors are known to fail and the roll sensor is non-critical to the operation of the glider, a back-up diagnostics system has been developed based on the dynamic model of the vehicle, capturing the change in buoyancy. Both systems are able to correctly detect the loss of the wing and notify pilots, who can re-plan missions to safely recover the vehicle."
9123363,Trajectory Planning for Navigation Aiding of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Autonomous underwater vehicles can perform seabed surveys with a higher resolution and quality than from equivalent ship-mounted sensors. Although high-grade inertial navigation systems aided by Doppler velocity logs can operate without external position references for extended durations, this may still be required to meet survey specifications. This paper presents a trajectory planning algorithm for an autonomous surface vessel with the purpose of aiding the navigation of one or multiple underwater vehicles using ultra-short baseline acoustic positioning. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a nonlinear program for the single-vehicle tracking scenario and mixed-integer nonlinear program for tracking of multiple vehicles. In the absence of external acoustic positioning, the horizontal uncertainties of all targets increase as functions of time and heading. The optimal placement of the surface vessel is calculated by considering the propagated acoustic measurement uncertainty, which varies according to the range and direction towards the target. The trajectories are generated by minimizing the uncertainty of all targets, while also considering penalties on the control inputs and obeying vessel kinematics. The approach is demonstrated through a series of simulations."
9714963,"Automated Driving, a Question of Trajectory Planning","stract:
In the field of automotive and autonomous mobility, this chapter considers that planning can be taken as a term used in a generic manner, partially encompassing control, but also trajectory planning and route planning. Trajectory planning constitutes an intermediate scale between route planning, going from an origin to a destination and control planning, which involves setting up the actuator controls which will make it possible to follow a given trajectory. There are many planning methods for indoor and outdoor mobile robotics. The main contribution of artificial intelligence to autonomous driving is its ability to reproduce and simulate the reasoning and learning abilities of drivers. The decision module directly integrates most of the legal and regulatory aspects of safety when generating speed profiles and ego‐vehicle trajectories. Multi‐objective trajectory planning tries to find a compromise when several conflicting objectives must be managed at the same time."
8936542,Research Advances and Challenges of Autonomous and Connected Ground Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology can provide a safe and convenient transportation solution for the public, but the complex and various environments in the real world make it difficult to operate safely and reliably. A connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) is an AV with vehicle connectivity capability, which enhances the situational awareness of the AV and enables the cooperation between AVs. Hence, CAV technology can enhance the capabilities and robustness of AV to be a promising transportation solution in the future. This paper introduces a representative architecture of CAVs and surveys the latest research advances, methods, and algorithms for sensing, perception, planning, and control of CAVs. It reviews the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice (when applicable) of a multi-layer Perception-Planning-Control architecture including on-board sensors and vehicular communications, the methods of sensor fusion and localization and mapping in the perception layer, the algorithms of decision making and trajectory planning in the planning layer, and the control strategies of trajectory tracking in the control layer. Furthermore, the implementations and impact of vehicle connectivity and the corresponding consequential challenges of cooperative perception, complex connected decision making, and multi-vehicle controls are summarized and their significant research issues enumerated. Most importantly, the critical review in this paper provides a list and discussion of the remaining challenges and unsolved problems of CAVs in each Section which would be helpful to researchers in the field. The comprehensive coverage of this paper makes it particularly useful to academic researchers, practitioners, and students alike."
9403490,Deep learning based image processing for proactive data collecting system for autonomous vehicle,"Autonomous vehicle is the topic that gains a lot of attentions in recent years. To enable autonomous vehicle, a huge amount of data needs to be collected and processed. One of the most promising method to improve the accuracy of data collection is using vehicle communication. With the help of vehicle communication, controlling and warning signal can be transmitted between vehicles. Consequently, necessary information such as identity, position, speed, moving direction, future behavior can be obtained with higher accuracy. This paper focuses on a type of vehicle communication system called optical camera communication. One of the most important components of optical camera communication system is image processing.

The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve much higher performance compared to its counterparts."
9249662,Generation of Autonomous Vehicle Validation Scenarios Using Crash Data,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is expected to make a transformative impact on mobility. As a step towards that direction, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and semiautonomous features have been increasingly deployed in modern vehicles. Consequently, there have been crashes reported for these vehicles while operating in autonomous mode. In this paper, we describe a methodology to use the information from these crashes for the validation of autonomous vehicles, which is the most critical obstacle in their mass deployment. We use existing crash databases and provide a methodology to automatically convert them into test scenarios in simulation, using our scenario generation framework. The methodology assists in validation by recreating crashes and their cousin scenarios. It is also instrumental in forming the requirements the accident reports for autonomous vehicles."
9733964,Fuzzy-Model-Based Lateral Control for Networked Autonomous Vehicle Systems Under Hybrid Cyber-Attacks,"This article addresses the problem of lateral control problem for networked-based autonomous vehicle systems. A novel solution is presented for nonlinear autonomous vehicles to smoothly follow the planned path under external disturbances and network-induced issues, such as cyber-attacks, time delays, and limited bandwidths. First, a fuzzy-model-based system is established to represent the nonlinear networked vehicle systems subject to hybrid cyber-attacks. To reduce the network burden and effects of cyber-attacks, an asynchronous resilient event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed. A dynamic output-feedback control method is developed to address the underlying problem. Conditions are derived to obtain the output-feedback controller and resilient asynchronous ETS such that the closed-loop switched fuzzy system is globally exponentially stable. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed new control design techniques."

The number of real-world driving scenarios is extremely large, and choosing effective test scenarios is essential, as well as combining simulated and real world testing. We present an industrial workbench of tools and workflows to generate efficient and effective test scenarios for active safety and autonomous driving functions. The workbench is based on existing engineering tools, and helps smoothly integrate simulated testing, with real vehicle parameters and software. We aim to validate the workbench with real cases and further refine the input model parameters and distributions."
9575913,Vehicle Routing Optimized for Autonomous Driving,"State-of-the-art route guidance systems aim at finding the optimal route based on the total estimated travel time. With the development of autonomous vehicles certain road links can already be driven autonomously. When obtaining route guidance travelers want to drive autonomously as long as possible. Thus, additional criteria with respect to autonomous driving (AD) need to be taken into account. This paper aims at finding the optimal route for AD. Besides the total travel time, we introduce the autonomous travel time and the number of take over requests by the vehicle to the driver as additional optimization criteria. Two methodologies are developed, which approach the problem of finding optimal AD routes. The first one is based on subjective perception and the second one is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. A case study is conducted and both methods are compared. It is shown that an optimal route for AD can be found uniquely."
8965226,On Driver-Vehicle-Environment Integration for Multi-Actuated Ground Vehicles Safety Advancement: An Overview of the Interdisciplinary Training Network in Multi-Actuated Ground Vehicles,"Transportation systems are invariably burdened with dynamically changing environmental conditions and ill-defined human factor. To raise ground vehicle safety on a new supreme level and to boost autonomous vehicles development driver-vehicle-environment cooperation is inevitable. In this paper, an overview of several existing driver-vehicle-environment integration methods with purpose of vehicle safety enhancement are stressed. Five unique and fundamentally different solutions are proposed, which have common similarity: the solutions are accomplished with machine learning algorithms. The methods aim at modelling drivers' or vehicles' behaviour with reasonable prediction accuracy under various complex scenarios. All five solutions are developed in individual projects in a framework of a continuous interdisciplinary European network ITEAM. The aim of the paper is to underline significant benefit of man-machine-environment integration in vehicle safety systems by exploiting fairly received tremendous attention machine learning methods."
9031155,Environmental Perception in Autonomous Vehicles Using Edge Level Situational Awareness,"Currently, assisted vehicles depend on GPS to deliver accurate navigation during their drive, making cellular network access essential to their function. Absence of network connectivity leads to navigation failure on vehicles that will require understanding the path ahead without GPS. Such a scenario is not a practical option when considering fully autonomous vehicles. A video analytics framework powered by edge computing can help tackle the challenge efficiently. In this paper, a general overview of the recent progresses and challenges in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is presented and an idea for new generation of assisted framework for AVs is discussed where the perception about the environment is achieved through drone level imagery. In this new technology, a fleet of drone provides situational awareness for autonomous vehicles and communicate with control system for better perception and more accurate decision. The main characteristic of the new assisted framework is to (i) provide drone level camera for image acquisition for a view of the area of interest of the autonomous vehicle, (ii) deliver Edge analytics using deep learning for on-board GPU based training model to provide situational awareness about the route with available geo-tagged images and landmarks, and; (iii) integrate perception and prediction with the autonomous vehicle decision making system for reliable and precise navigation."
9267929,A Hybrid Path Planning Strategy of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) play a unique role in many applications, including oceanographic research, country defense, ecosystem monitoring, to name a few. The autonomy of AUVs is utilized in automatically planning a feasible path/trajectory to a goal point. A robust planner of AUVs should be able to search a collision-free path/trajectory not only in a large-scale known static environment, but also in the environment with dynamic obstacles. This paper demonstrates a modified and combined Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) and Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*) to plan both the local trajectory and the global path for AUVs in environments where dynamic obstacles may appear. In case of dynamic obstacles, the planner automatically judges the risk of collision and switches from RRT* to DWA if necessary. Then the planner switches back after collision risk is dismissed. Hence, by switching between two algorithms, the balance of real-time computation and the globally optimal solution is achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid planning strategy is verified by simulation."
9519840,An Enhanced Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Detecting Malicious Activities From Autonomous Vehicles,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are susceptible to safety and security concerns that impend people's lives. Nothing like manually controlled vehicles, the safekeeping of communications and computing constituents of AVs can be threatened using sophisticated hacking techniques, consequently disrupting AVs from the operative usage in our daily life routines. Once manually controlled vehicles are linked to the Internet, so-called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), they would be misused by cyberattacks. In this paper, we present a multi-stage intrusion detection framework to identify intrusions from ITSs and produce low rate of false alarms. The proposed framework can automatically distinguish intrusions in real-time. The proposed framework is based on normal state-based and a deep learning-centered bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to efficiently discover intrusions from the fundamental network gateways and communication networks of AVs. The designed framework is evaluated through two benchmark datasources, that is, the UNSWNB-15 datasource for exterior network communications and the car hacking datasource for in-vehicle communications. The outcomes indicated that the proposed framework achieves high performance that outperforms various current state-of-the-art systems with an accuracy rate of 98.88% for the UNSWNB-15 dataset and 99.11% for the car hacking dataset. Besides, the proposed framework is furthermore capable to detect zero-day (concealed) outbreaks from IoVs networks."
9073320,Hardware-in-the-Loop Platform for Testing Autonomous Vehicle Control Algorithms,"Autonomous vehicles are a demanding topic which has attracted a lot of attention lately. This kind of vehicle should be capable of sensing its environment and react on the presence of obstacles and other traffic participants. Algorithms for obstacle avoidance and overall control of the autonomous driving in relation to robustness regarding environmental conditions are required for driving safely on roads. For the development of these algorithms, a safe environment is needed. In order to speed up the development of the algorithms, this paper proposes a Hardware in the loop (HIL) based test environment and analysis of it for autonomous vehicle development. Proposed HIL is combining a virtual driving environment based on Unity (game engine) and Apollo (an open autonomous driving platform) as well as a real car. Unity provides ability to vary weather, road conditions and driving scenarios. Apollo includes all the code necessary for autonomous driving and consists of numerous modules: localization, perception, control, routing, safety module and others. This will allow the testing of algorithms in various conditions and scenarios in a safe way while being closer to real world. Possible challenges with realization of the HIL are discussed and highlighted in this paper."
9712209,An Integrated Decision-Making Framework for Highway Autonomous Driving Using Combined Learning and Rule-based Algorithm,"In order to solve the manual labelling, long-tail effect and driving conservatism of the existing decision-making algorithm. This paper proposed an integrated decision-making framework (IDF) for highway autonomous vehicles. Firstly, states of the highway traffic are extracted by the velocity, time headway (TH) and the probabilistic lane distribution of the surrounding vehicles. With the extracted traffic state, the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is adopted to learn the optimal state-action pair for specific scenario. Analogously, by mapping millions of traffic scenarios, huge amounts of state-action pairs can be stored in the experience pool. Then the imitation learning (IL) is further employed to memorize the experience pool by deep neural networks. The learning result shows that the accuracy of the decision network can reach 94.17%. Besides, for some imperfect decisions of the network, the rule-based method is taken to rectify by judging the long-term reward. Finally, the IDF is simulated in G25 highway and has promising results, which can always drive the vehicle to the state with high efficiency while ensuring safety."
8854189,Path Tracking Control for Autonomous Vehicles Based on an Improved MPC,"In this paper, an improved Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller based on fuzzy adaptive weight control is proposed to solve the problem of autonomous vehicle in the process of path tracking. The controller not only ensures the tracking accuracy, but also considers the vehicle dynamic stability in the process of tracking, i.e., the vehicle dynamics model is used as the controller model. Moreover, the problem of driving comfort caused by the application of classical MPC controller when the vehicle is deviated from the target path is solved. This controller is mainly realized by adaptively improving the weight of the cost function in the classical MPC through the fuzzy adaptive control algorithm. A comparative study which compares the proposed controller with the pure-pursuit controller and the classical MPC controller is made: through the CarSim-Matlab/Simulink co-simulations, the results show that this controller presents better tracking performance than the latter ones considering both tracking accuracy and steering smoothness."
9497477,Autonomous navigation through a system of systems cooperation,"The scientific issue addressed in this paper is the optimal management of the guidance of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAV) in dead zones, where navigational signals such as Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) are absent or unreachable in Container Terminal (CT) environment. In this framework, we propose a concept of system of systems (SoS), allowing reconstructing communication of IAV without navigation from a cooperation between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to Intelligent Autonomous Vehicle (IAV-UAV). Thus, a model-based cooperative (SoS) is developed from theory and practice, demonstrating the five properties of: managerial independency, operational independency, cooperative behaviour, geographical dispersion and evolutionary development. Simulation and experimental results are presented in this work."
9575619,GPU based model-predictive path control for self-driving vehicles,"One central challenge for self-driving cars is a proper path-planning. Once a trajectory has been found, the next challenge is to accurately and safely follow the precalculated path. The model-predictive controller (MPC) is a common approach for the lateral control of autonomous vehicles. The MPC uses a vehicle dynamics model to predict the future states of the vehicle for a given prediction horizon. However, in order to achieve real-time path control, the computational load is usually large, which leads to short prediction horizons. To deal with the computational load, the control algorithm can be parallelized on the graphics processing unit (GPU). In contrast to the widely used stochastic methods, in this paper we propose a deterministic approach based on grid search. Our approach focuses on systematically discovering the search area with different levels of granularity. To achieve this, we split the optimization algorithm into multiple iterations. The best sequence of each iteration is then used as an initial solution to the next iteration. The granularity increases, resulting in smooth and predictable steering angle sequences. We present a novel GPU-based algorithm and show its accuracy and realtime abilities with a number of real-world experiments."
9326596,Post-Impact Stability Control for Four-Wheel- Independently-Actuated Electric Vehicles,"Relevant studies show that vehicle instability such as drifting and spinning after the first impact may have further severe implications in road vehicle collision accidents. This paper presents a post-impact stability control scheme for four-wheel-independently-actuated electric vehicles (FWIA EVs). First, a sliding mode controller is designed to produce the reference yaw moment to attenuate undesired yaw motion after the first impact. Then, an optimization-based algorithm is developed for optimal wheel torque allocation and steering angle coordination to follow the derived reference yaw moment. Finally, the holistic algorithm is verified through co-simulation of Matlab/Simulink and CarSim. The verification results show that the developed scheme performs well and can maintain the stability of the test vehicle after a maximum lateral-rear impact impulse of 3500 Ns."
8859418,Safe Traffic Sign Recognition through Data Augmentation for Autonomous Vehicles Software,"Context: Since autonomous vehicles operate in an open context, their software components, including data-driven ones, have to reliably process inputs (e.g., obtained by cameras) in order to make safe decisions. A key challenge when providing reliable data-driven components is insufficient training data, which could lead to wrong interpretation of the environment, thereby causing accidents. Aim: The goal of our research is to extend available training data of data-driven components for safe autonomous vehicles using the example of traffic sign recognition. Method: We developed an approach to create realistic image augmentations of various quality deficits and applied them on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark dataset (GTSRB). Results: The approach results in images augmented with (any combination of) seven different quality deficits affecting traffic sign recognition (rain, dirt on lens, steam on lens, darkness, motion blur, dirt on sign, backlight) and considers dependencies between combined quality deficits and influences from other contextual information. Conclusion: Our approach can be used to obtain more comprehensive datasets, especially also including samples with quality deficits that are difficult to gather. By structuring the augmentation into a set of basic components, the approach can be adapted for other application domains (e.g., person detection)."
9339989,Estimating the Probability That a Vehicle Reaches a Near-Term Goal State Using Multiple Lane Changes,"This article proposes a model to estimate the probability of a vehicle reaching a near-term goal state using one or multiple lane changes based on parameters corresponding to traffic conditions and driving behavior. The proposed model not only has broad application in path planning and autonomous vehicle navigation, it can also be incorporated in advance warning systems to reduce traffic delay during recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. The model is first formulated for a two-lane road segment through systemic reduction of the number of parameters and transforming the problem into an abstract statistical form, for which the probability can be calculated numerically. It is then extended to cases with a higher number of lanes using the law of total probability. VISSIM simulations are used to validate the predictions of the model and study the effect of different parameters on the probability. For most cases, simulation results are within 4% of model predictions, and the effect of different parameters such as driving behavior and traffic density on the probability match our expectation. The model can be implemented with near real-time performance, with computation time increasing linearly with the number of lanes."
8843618,An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Framework Design for Autonomous Flight Path,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has become a preferred choice due to it robustness, reliability and efficiency, at an economically lower cost. The present study is intended to develop a UAV that is capable of navigating autonomously, using path planning algorithm, incorporating a collision avoidance approach at the lowest possible cost. This paper addresses the current issues of auto-piloting UAVs with collision avoidance mechanisms, that are commercially available, however, these systems are too large and expensive. The framework design of the UAV consists of a quadcopter frame, a flight controller, four motors, a Global Positioning System (GPS) system, an on-board telemetry system, a battery source and a raspberry pi camera processor board with a camera module. In the proposed UAV design, a preliminary software is designed to enable the UAV to navigate autonomously, on a pre-set designated flight path. The designed UAV provides a birds-eye view of its designated flight path to monitor the traffic flow."

The presented semi-dynamic wireless system consists of short length (1.5m) of power line for static charging and long length (5m) of power line for dynamic charging around vehicle stop. In this paper, several important system parameters are obtained through the magnetic simulation and the prototype system is implemented in the laboratory. Finally, the performance of the presented system is verified through test result, that is, the maximum power efficiency is 90.8% for static charging and is upper 85% for dynamic charging."
9014458,"Autonomous vehicles lite self-driving technologies should start small, go slow","Many young urbanites don't want to own a car, and unlike earlier generations, they don't have to rely on mass transit. Instead they treat mobility as a service: When they need to travel significant distances, say, more than 5 miles (8 kilometers), they use their phones to summon an Uber (or a car from a similar ride-sharing company). If they have less than a mile or so to go, they either walk or use various “micromobility” services, such as the increasingly ubiquitous Lime and Bird scooters or, in some cities, bike sharing. The problem is that today's mobility-as-a-service ecosystem often doesn't do a good job covering intermediate distances, say a few miles. Hiring an Uber or Lyft for such short trips proves frustratingly expensive, and riding a scooter or bike more than a mile or so can be taxing to many people. So getting yourself to a destination that is from 1 to 5 miles away can be a challenge. Yet such trips account for about half of the total passenger miles traveled. Many of these intermediate-distance trips take place in environments with limited traffic, such as university campuses and industrial parks, where it is now both economically reasonable and technologically possible to deploy small, low-speed autonomous vehicles powered by electricity. We've been involved with a startup that intends to make this form of transportation popular. The company, PerceptIn, has autonomous vehicles operating at tourist sites in Nara and Fukuoka, Japan; at an industrial park in Shenzhen, China; and is just now arranging for its vehicles to shuttle people around Fishers, Ind., the location of the company's headquarters."
8411139,Compensating Delays and Noises in Motion Control of Autonomous Electric Vehicles by Using Deep Learning and Unscented Kalman Predictor,"Accurate knowledge of the vehicle states is the foundation of vehicle motion control. However, in real implementations, sensory signals are always corrupted by delays and noises. Network induced time-varying delays and measurement noises can be a hazard in the active safety of over-actuated electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, a brain-inspired proprioceptive system based on state-of-the-art deep learning and data fusion technique is proposed to solve this problem in autonomous four-wheel actuated EVs. A deep recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained by the noisy and delayed measurement signals to make accurate predictions of the vehicle motion states. Then unscented Kalman predictor, which is the adaption of unscented Kalman filter in time-varying-delay situations, combines the predictions of the RNN and corrupted sensory signals to provide better perceptions of the locomotion. Simulations with a high-fidelity, CarSim, full-vehicle model are carried out to show the effectiveness of our RNN framework and the entire proprioceptive system."
9272872,Adaptive Robust Game-Theoretic Decision Making Strategy for Autonomous Vehicles in Highway,"In a typical traffic scenario, autonomous vehicles are required to share the road with other road participants, e.g., human driven vehicles, pedestrians, etc. To successfully navigate the traffic, an adaptive robust level- k framework can be used by the autonomous agents to categorize the agents based on their depth of strategic thought and act accordingly. However, mismatch between the vehicle dynamics and its predictions, and improper classification of the agents can lead to undesirable behavior or collision. Robust approaches can handle the uncertainties, however, might result in a conservative behavior of the autonomous vehicle. This paper proposes an adaptive robust decision making strategy for autonomous vehicles to handle model mismatches in the prediction model while utilizing the confidence of the driver behavior to obtain less conservative actions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated for a lane change maneuver in a highway driving scenario."
9291540,The Research on Control and Dynamic Property of Autonomous Vehicle Adaptive Lidar System,"Autonomous driving has attracted remarkable attention from both industry and academic, lidar is one of the most sensors in the core module of autonomous driving, it plays an important role in vehicle positioning and obstacle avoidance, Lidar is usually expensive and noble, but to reduce the blind area of vehicles, it has to increase the number of lidars, making autonomous vehicles are expensive. Based on this background, a servo system with two degrees of freedom is designed in this paper to make up for blind spots in a lidar system. Autonomous vehicle lidar servo system works when the car turns, goes up and down ramps. Based on the kinematic behavior of the vehicle, dynamic analysis was performed, the angle of lidar detection changes with the rotation of the steering wheel, and the tilt angle of the vehicle body. The blind area caused by the angle of the vehicle can be avoided. The servo lidar control system was simulated by MATLAB, and its performance was verified. In a word, the blind zone of an autonomous driving vehicles can be effectively reduced. At the same times lidars can be fully utilized to reduce hardware costs."
9605690,Autonomous Vehicle Evaluation: A Comprehensive Survey on Modeling and Simulation Approaches,"In recent years, autonomous vehicles (AVs), which observe the driving environment and lead a few or all of the driving tasks, have garnered tremendous success. The field of AVs has been rapidly developing and has found many applications. As a safety requirement established by policymakers, these vehicles must be evaluated before their deployment. The evaluation process for AVs is challenging because crashes are rare events, and AVs can escape passing predefined test scenarios. Therefore, capturing crashes and creating real test scenarios should be considered in order to develop an evaluation approach that represents real-world scenarios. One evaluation approach is based on the naturalistic field operational test (N-FOT), in which prototype AVs are driven on roads by volunteers or test engineers. Unfortunately, this approach is time-consuming and costly because thousands of miles need to be driven to experience a police-reported collision and nearly millions of miles for a fatal crash. Another approach is the accelerated evaluation method. The core idea of the accelerated evaluation approach is to modify the statistics of naturalistic driving so that safety-critical events are emphasized. This paper presents a brief survey of the advances that have occurred in the area of the evaluation of partially or fully autonomous vehicles, starting with naturalistic field operational tests (N-FOTs). The review covers the test matrix evaluation, worst-case scenario evaluation (WCSE), Monte Carlo simulations, and accelerated evaluation (AE). We also present all the simulation-based and agent-based modeling approaches that do not follow any evaluation protocol listed above. This study provides a scientific analysis of each evaluation techniques, focusing on their advantages/disadvantages, inherent restrictions, practicability, and optimality. The results reveal that the accelerated evaluation approach outperforms naturalistic field operational tests (N-FOTs), test matrix evaluatio...

9538410,Research on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control System for Autonomous Vehicles based on Distributed Model Predictive Control,"As a beneficial way of increasing traffic capacity, autonomous vehicle platoons have paid extensive attention recently. This study proposes a Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) algorithm with input constraints. This algorithm is a suitable application for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) in the vehicle platoon. The platoon’s leading vehicle is to track an imposed velocity reference, the rest of the platoon is to track the velocity of the preceding while maintaining an imposed desired reference between any consecutive vehicles, which is proportional to its velocity. A varied communication range in the predecessor following (PF) topology is used for a platoon. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with some illustrative results."
9376709,Safe Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Monte Carlo Tree Search,"Reinforcement learning has gradually demonstrated its decision-making ability in autonomous driving. Reinforcement learning is learning how to map states to actions by interacting with environment so as to maximize the long-term reward. Within limited interactions, the learner will get a suitable driving policy according to the designed reward function. However there will be a lot of unsafe behaviors during training in traditional reinforcement learning. This paper proposes a RL-based method combined with RL agent and Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to reduce unsafe behaviors. The proposed safe reinforcement learning framework mainly consists of two modules: risk state estimation module and safe policy search module. Once the future state will be risky calculated by the risk state estimation module using current state information and the action outputted by the RL agent, the MCTS based safe policy search module will activate to guarantee a safer exploration by adding an additional reward for risk actions. We test the approach in several random overtake scenarios, resulting in faster convergence and safer behaviors compared to traditional reinforcement learning."
9362972,A review of deep learning models for traffic flow prediction in Autonomous Vehicles,"More and more rapid development has been seen in the last decade in self-driving car technologies, mostly developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning. The goal of the paper is to review the latest state of the art in the area of automated driving by using machine learning technologies. For autonomous vehicle usage the estimation of traffic flows is necessary and they agree to make changes about their relevant artefacts (e.g., turn left or correct, travel straight, shift direction, stop or speed). Work on autonomous vehicles has been seen from the current paper on machine learning methods. Moreover, the non-linear dynamic relationship between spatial and temporal data obtained from the surroundings at the previously described adaptive decision-making periods by vehicles does not extend explicitly to current machine learning models in this context. Throughout this paper, we discussed the learning models for autonomous vehicle traffic flux prediction throughout order to equate such models with their applicability in contemporary intelligent transport systems. In comparison, the paper further addresses problems and possible recommendations for science."
9306795,Decoupled Longitudinal and Lateral Vehicle Control Based Autonomous Lane Change System Adaptable to Driving Surroundings,"The purpose of this study is to develop an autonomous lane change control system that adapts to variable surrounding conditions, to ensure vehicle safety and traffic flow stability. In this paper, we propose decision-making and control procedures for realizing autonomous lane changing; to this end, we consider not only behaviors for changing lanes but also those involved in approaching the lane changing state, with a focus on the controller design. A decoupled control structure and longitudinal trajectory-free control approach are suggested. We design a novel inter-vehicle spacing policy and a 3DOF lateral error vehicle dynamics model. To verify the effectiveness of our system, simulation experiments are performed for 12 scenarios, and system assessments are conducted based on four evaluation perspectives. The results confirm that our system can safely control the vehicle amidst various surrounding vehicle conditions and can also ensure vehicle motion stability. Furthermore, we solve the existing dynamic instability problem of lateral control, which arises through longitudinal acceleration variability. Another significant advantage of this model is that the controlled vehicle does not interfere with the target-lane traffic flow and smoothly synchronizes with the flow during lane changing."
9314904,An Improved Real-Time Slip Model Identification Method for Autonomous Tracked Vehicles Using Forward Trajectory Prediction Compensation,"The complex slip characteristics between the tracks and the terrain make it difficult to build an accurate model for intelligent tracked vehicles. Both the path planning and lateral control, however, are highly dependent on the accurate tracked vehicle model. To overcome the issue, a slip model based on the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of tracks and a dual-layer adaptive unscented Kalman filter (DAUKF) are used to estimate the ICR locations in real-time without requiring prior knowledge of terrain parameters. First, the historical trajectory information is used to estimate ICR locations by the upper-layer AUKF estimator preliminarily. The ICR locations estimated in the upper-layer and the current vehicle state are then imported into the model to predict the future trajectory which can be used to estimate the offset as compensation of preliminarily estimated ICR locations by the lower-layer AUKF estimator. The proposed DAUKF is verified by simulations on MATLAB/Simulink. In order to further verify the effectiveness and practicability of the algorithm, a large number of experiments under different terrains and road conditions are implemented on the electric-drive tracked vehicle. The simulation and experimental results illustrate that the proposed DAUKF can estimate the ICR locations efficiently and accurately, which can improve the accuracy of the tracked vehicle model compared with those of extended Kalman filter (EKF), UKF, and AUKF."

The aim of this paper is to evaluate different approaches to communicate the intent of an autonomous vehicle. A survey study was conducted among Estonian people to analyze their understanding of animations of more prominent explicit external interaction modalities. The study revealed that participants may not understand the vehicle intent if they have no prior knowledge about the displayed signals."

9244620,Optimal Time-Consuming Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Based on a Dynamic Neural Network Model in Ocean Current Environments,"Path planning is a prerequisite for autonomous underwater vehicles to perform tasks autonomously. Many shortest distance algorithms are applied, and ocean currents are ignored to plan a short path in distance, which is usually time and energy consuming. In fact, the favourable currents can be exploited while avoiding the opposite ocean flows. Based on the bioinspired neural network architecture, this paper proposes a novel dynamic neural network model to plan the time-saving path in ocean current environments. After that, the path is smoothed by the B-spline algorithm. Analysis of the model shows that it can find out the minimum time path. Many simulations have also been introduced to test the effectiveness of the proposed model, showing good results. The dynamic neural network model has no learning procedure and can run in parallel. It has the advantages of loose parameter restrictions and wide spreading of neural activities. In addition, it has also been proven to be suitable for strong ocean currents."

A future dynamic trajectory of the automatic vehicle, and the parameters of the traffic environment, such as the curvature and width of a traffic lane and the distance to a barrier, are applied to construct the diagnostic model for making the self-driving car has the last line of defense to prevent danger. The improvement of decisions along with our proposed model is investigated through an on-road experiment.

Using virtualization offers other benefits than simulation and testing as a virtual environment can often be more liberally configured than the corresponding physical environment. This, in turn, introduces new possibilities for education and training, including both for humans and artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, we are developing a simulation platform AILiveSim. The platform is built on top of the Unreal Engine (www.unrealengine.com) game development system, and it is dedicated to training and testing autonomous systems, their sensors and their algorithms in a simulated environment. In this paper, we describe the elements that we have built on top of the engine to realize a Virtual Environment (VE) useful for the design, implementation, application and analysis of autonomous systems.

9334558,Cooperative Multi-Modal Localization in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Cooperative Localization is expected to play a crucial role in various applications in the field of Connected and Autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Future 5G wireless systems are expected to enable cost-effective Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems, allowing CAVs to share with the other entities of the network the data they collect and measure. Typical measurement models usually deployed for this problem, are absolute position from Global Positioning System (GPS), relative distance and azimuth angle to neighbouring vehicles, extracted from Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) or Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) sensors. In this paper, we provide a cooperative localization approach that performs multi modal-fusion between the interconnected vehicles, by representing a fleet of connected cars as an undirected graph, encoding each vehicle position relative to its neighbouring vehicles. This method is based on: i) the Laplacian Processing, a Graph Signal Processing tool that allows to capture intrinsic geometry of the undirected graph of vehicles rather than their absolute position on global coordinate system and ii) the temporal coherence due to motion patterns of the moving vehicles."

Localization in autonomous driving is an important technology. Attention is focused on accurate 3D mapping and point cloud data, because this map data is needed to estimate vehicle position. However, the constructed 3D point group may have errors due to the measurement. Localization has also been known to fail in places where the terrain has few distinct features. Our technique focuses on localization process to evaluate the map. The goal of our proposal is to calculate the probability of success or failure of localization. This evaluation method uses convergence by matching. Evaluation tests showed that the places where the localization is possible, and the place where the error remains on the map can be clearly separated. In future, the range of the input 3D point cloud is made into the range applicable to Localization, and we evaluate the validity of the proposed method by increasing the set."

8814215,A Data Driven Method of Feedforward Compensator Optimization for Autonomous Vehicle Control,"A reliable controller is critical for execution of safe and smooth maneuvers of an autonomous vehicle. The controller must be robust to external disturbances, such as road surface, weather, wind conditions, and so on. It also needs to deal with internal variations of vehicle sub-systems, including powertrain inefficiency, measurement errors, time delay, etc. These factors introduce issues in controller performance. In this paper, a feedforward compensator is designed via a data-driven method to model and optimize the controller's performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for extracting influential features, after which a Time Delay Neural Network is adopted to predict control errors over a future time horizon. Based on the predicted error, a feedforward compensator is then designed to improve control performance. Simulation results in different scenarios show that, with the help of with the proposed feedforward compensator, the maximum path tracking error and the steering wheel angle oscillation are improved by 44.4% and 26.7%, respectively."
8698763,Collision Avoidance/Mitigation System: Motion Planning of Autonomous Vehicle via Predictive Occupancy Map,"Despite development efforts toward autonomous vehicle technologies, the number of collisions and driver interventions of autonomous vehicles tested in California seems to be reaching a plateau. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of defensive driving functionality; i.e. emergency collision avoidance when other human drivers make mistakes. In this paper, a collision avoidance/mitigation system (CAMS) is proposed to rapidly evaluate risks associated with all surrounding vehicles and to maneuver the vehicle into a safer region when faced with critically dangerous situations. First, a risk assessment module, namely, predictive occupancy map (POM), is proposed to compute potential risks associated with surrounding vehicles based on relative position, velocity, and acceleration. Then, the safest trajectory with the lowest risk level is selected among the 12 local trajectories through the POM. To ensure stable and successful collision avoidance of the ego-vehicle, the lateral and longitudinal acceleration profiles are planned while considering the vehicle stability limit. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated based on side and rear-end collision scenarios, which are difficult to predict and to monitor. The simulation results show that the proposed CAMS via POM detect a collision risk 1.4 s before the crash, and avoids the collision successfully."

Therefore, the traffic flow in mixed environments may be worse than in the case in which the environment includes only autonomous vehicles. In our previous research, we proposed a protocol for this environment. However, our evaluation was restricted to limited areas. In this paper, we evaluate our protocol for wide areas and discuss our results."
8883783,Method of Pedestrian-vehicle Conflict Eliminating at Unsignalized Mid-block Crosswalks for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous driving has become a popular topic in both industry and academia. For autonomous vehicles, driving safety is the primary prerequisite. Pedestrians are important traffic participants in urban roads. In the process of pedestrian-vehicle interaction, for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles in different locations at crosswalks, different conflicts eliminating measures may need to be adopted by autonomous vehicles, to ensure safety and efficiency of pedestrians and vehicles. According to different locations of vehicles and pedestrians, a conflict eliminating model of autonomous vehicle is proposed. Moreover, a cellular automaton model is developed to simulate the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. For vehicles and pedestrians in different locations, the model eliminates possible conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles according to rules. The results showed that the proposed conflict eliminating method can effectively avoid the conflict between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Pedestrian safety and efficiency are improved significantly. Moreover, the efficiency of vehicle is also improved."

The aim of the autonomous vehicle deployment is the study of unknown environmental spatial features. The proposed approach allows the solution of both boundary tracking and source-seeking problems with a single autonomous vehicle capable of sensing the value of the spatial field at its position. The movement of the vehicle is controlled through the proposed guidance strategy, which is designed on the basis of the collected measurements without the necessity of preplanning or human intervention. Moreover, no a priori knowledge about the field and its gradient is required. The proposed strategy is based on the so-called suboptimal sliding mode controller. The guidance strategy is demonstrated by computer-based simulations and a set of boundary tracking experimental sea trials. The efficacy of the algorithm to autonomously steer the C-Enduro surface vehicle to follow a fixed depth contour in a dynamic coastal region is demonstrated by the results from the trial described in this paper."

For flexibly implementing of ethical rules, the Lexicographic Optimization-based model predictive controller (LO-MPC) has been designed, in which obstacles and constraints are prioritized. Simulation environment is set up in PreScan, with different edge cases. The results show that the proposed LO-MPC approach has the capability to deal with the ethical decision-making during inevitable crashes by avoiding the obstacles with the assumed priority orders compared with traditional decision-making algorithm."

9229189,Multi-Sensor Multi-Vehicle (MSMV) Localization and Mobility Tracking for Autonomous Driving,"Vehicle localization and mobility tracking are important tasks in autonomous driving. Traditional methods either have insufficient accuracy or rely on additional facilities to reach the desired accuracy for autonomous driving. In this paper, a multi-sensor multi-vehicle localization and mobility tracking framework is developed for autonomous vehicles equipped with GPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and an integrated sensing system. Our algorithm fuse the information from local onboard sensors as well as the observations of other vehicles or existing intelligent transportation system infrastructure such as road side units (RSU) to improve the precision and stability of localization and mobility tracking. Specifically, this framework incorporates the dynamic model of vehicles to achieve better localization and tracking performance. The communication delays during the information sharing process are explicitly taken into account in our algorithm development. Simulations manifest that not only the accuracy of localization and mobility tracking could be greatly enhanced in general, but also the robustness can be guaranteed under circumstances where traditional localization and tracking devices fail."
8626127,Autonomous Navigation for Unmanned Underwater Vehicles: Real-Time Experiments Using Computer Vision,"This letter studies the problem of autonomous navigation for unmanned underwater vehicles, using computer vision for localization. Parallel tracking and mapping is employed to localize the vehicle with respect to a visual map, using a single camera, whereas an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to fuse the visual information with data from an inertial measurement unit, in order to recover the scale of the map and improve the pose estimation. A proportional integral derivative controller controller with compensation of the restoring forces is proposed to accomplish trajectory tracking, where a pressure sensor and a magnetometer provide feedback for depth control and yaw, respectively, while the remaining states are provided by the EKF. Real-time experiments are presented to validate the navigation strategy, using a commercial remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the BlueROV2, which was adapted to perform as an autonomous underwater vehicle with the help of the robot operative system."
9302449,Image Processing Based Transportation In Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has become popular in many fields, especially in the defense industry.

In this study, a high-mobility and low-cost rotary wing UAV with autonomous flight is designed. The UAV, which performs autonomous flight, is intended to recognize and receive 2 different loads of different weight in the cargo receiving area by using image processing methods. In addition, it is aimed to transfer the two loads received by the weight sensor to the weight drop area at a predetermined GPS point by classifying them according to their weight.

9277522,Toward Achieving Fine-Grained Access Control of Data in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"A connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) is often fitted with a large number of onboard sensors and applications to support autonomous driving functions. Based on the current research, little work on applications' access to in-vehicle data has been done. Furthermore, most existing autonomous driving operating systems lack authentication and encryption units. As such, applications can excessively obtain confidential information, such as vehicle location and owner preferences and even upload it to the cloud, threatening the security of the vehicle and the privacy of the owner. In this study, we propose a fine-grained access control scheme to restrict applications' access to data in CAVs (FGAC-inCAVs). First, we present a system model composed of the following elements: a trusted third party (TTP), which is a fully trusted authority; perception components like sensors, which can capture the road information (pictures, videos, etc.); and multiple applications. Then, a fast attribute-based encryption (ABE) is presented, and security analysis also shows it is secure against selective and chosen-plaintext attacks. Furthermore, we propose a key update scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency."
9667332,Autonomous Intersection Management for Connected and Automated Vehicles: A Lane-Based Method,"Most existing studies on autonomous intersection management (AIM) often focus on algorithms to accommodate conflicts among vehicles by assuming that the entrance lane and the exit lane of vehicles are exogenous inputs. This paper shows that allowing entrance lanes and exit lanes to be optimized can significantly improve traffic efficiency. In particular, this paper proposes ``all-direction'' lanes, where left-turn, through, and right-turn traffic is all allowed at the same lane. We develop two methods for optimizing entering time (i.e., when to enter the intersection) and route choice decisions (i.e., entrance lane and exit lane), including the sliding-time-window-based global optimum (GO-STW) and the first-come-first-served method with optimal route choices (FCFS-R). The developed lane-based methods can be formulated as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, which can be solved using the CPLEX solver. A heuristic is further adopted to solve the MILP model in a timely manner, which illustrates the potential real-time applicability of the proposed method. Numerical analysis is conducted to examine performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods and heuristic. We found that the optimization of lane/route choices is often more critical than entering time."
9367130,Traffic Flow Management of Autonomous Vehicles Using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Smart Rerouting,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) promise to disrupt the traditional systems of transportation. An autonomous driving environment requires an uninterrupted, continuous stream of data and information based on complex traffic data sets and predictive measurements to make critical and real-time decisions in uncertain situations. Such an environment fosters a self-organizing system where vehicles must be seamlessly connected and various other services and intelligent decisions to manage traffic flow must be executed in an emergent manner. To proceed towards this vision, in this paper, we develop a traffic flow management model which is based on a novel two-phase approach for AVs to optimize traffic during congestion periods. In the first phase of our approach, we build an adaptive traffic signal control, using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize traffic flow on road intersections during the periods when traffic is congested. In the second phase, we implement a Smart Re-routing (SR) technique for the traffic approaching intersections. Re-routing is used to carry out load-balancing of traffic to alternate paths to avoid congested road intersections. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach is validated using simulations that demonstrate up to 31% improved performance efficiency compared to the traditional settings using pre-timed signals and without re-routing. The two-phase approach improves the overall traffic flow while reducing delays and minimizing long traffic queues' lengths. This approach is useful for making infrastructure intelligent enough to handle traffic congestion and balance traffic flow efficiently."

9208340,Using Connected Autonomous Transportation Vehicles (CATV) to Teach Engineering Ethics,"Engineering Ethics is an important but difficult topic to teach or incorporate in technical curricula. Most students and many faculty believe ethics is important for personal behavior but not really relevant to the engineering process. Part of this stems from the fact that the artifacts and processes created by engineers generally do not make “ethical” decisions so they can not behave unethically. Ethics is ascribed to the engineers and users. The process is inviolate. This tends to make learning engineering ethics dull with many students failing to see its relevance to their engineering process. CATV's on the other hand provide a current, real world problem in which ethics will be embedded. In this paper how CATV's can be used to teach engineering ethics is described as a way to interest students in the topic and to show them its relevance to their design processes."

To decrease this count, it has been said that autonomous vehicles can play a major role. The autonomous vehicle uses different sensors such as LIDAR, RADAR, Ultrasonic sensors, and cameras for detection of lane lines, objects, traffic sign, traffic lights, and driving path. There are several successful projects on autonomous vehicles, but the main limitations are high costs and regulations. The camera can be a cost-effective solution as compare to LIDAR in all the basic detection needed for autonomous driving. The proper placement of sensors on the vehicle plays an important role in efficient design, working and reducing the cost of the overall autonomous vehicle system. This paper discusses the parameters considered while deciding the positioning of the camera, and the geometric calculation for the best positioning of a monocular camera on an autonomous vehicle."

Consequently, it is from many perspectives advantageous to be able to quantify the potential benefits of new autonomous systems for vehicle maneuvers at-the-limit of tire friction. Here, to estimate the potential in terms of saved lives and reduced degree of injuries in accidents for new, not yet existing systems, a framework has been developed by combining available historic data, in the form of crash databases, and statistical methods with comparative calculations of vehicle behavior using numerical optimization rather than simulation. The framework performs effectively, it gives interesting insights into the relation between more traditional active yaw control and optimal autonomous lane-keeping control, and it clearly demonstrates the potential of saved lives by using autonomous vehicle maneuvers."

However, scaling autonomous driving to low-power systems deployed on dynamic environments poses several challenges that prevent their adoption. To address them, we propose a closed- loop learning flow for autonomous driving mini-vehicles that includes the target environment in-the-loop. We leverage a family of compact and high-throughput tinyCNNs to control the mini- vehicle, which learn in the target environment by imitating a computer vision algorithm, i.e., the expert. Thus, the tinyCNNs, having only access to an on-board fast-rate linear camera, gain robustness to lighting conditions and improve over time. Further, we leverage GAP8, a parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, to meet the inference requirements. When running the family of CNNs, our GAP8's solution outperforms any other implementation on the STM32L4 and NXP k64f (Cortex-M4), reducing the latency by over 13x and the energy consummation by 92%."
9138639,Towards Trustworthy Perception Information Sharing on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Sharing perception data among autonomous vehicles is extremely useful to extending the line of sight and field of view of autonomous vehicles, which otherwise suffer from blind spots and occlusions. However, the security of using data from a random other car in making driving decisions is an issue. Without the ability of assessing the trustworthiness of received information, it will be too risky to use them for any purposes. On the other hand, when information is exchanged between vehicles, it provides a golden opportunity to quantitatively study a vehicle's trust. In this paper, we propose a trustworthy information sharing framework for connected and autonomous vehicles in which vehicles measure each other's trust using the Dirichlet-Categorical (DC) model. To increase a vehicle's capability of assessing received data's trust, we leverage the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) model to increase the resolution of blurry images. As a result, a vehicle is able to evaluate the trustworthiness of received data that contain distant objects. Based on the KITTI dataset, we evaluate the proposed solution and discover that vehicle's trust assessment capability can be increased by 11 - 37%, using the ESRGAN model."

However, the appearance of uncertainty makes the accurate path following more difficult, which has become an acknowledged challenge for path following control design of autonomous vehicles. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive constraint control scheme for autonomous electric vehicles under the influence of parametric uncertainty. Firstly, an adaptive feedback control with its update law is proposed. Utilizing the proposed adaptive control scheme, the path following action can be implemented considering the changeable wheel cornering stiffness of the studied autonomous electric vehicle. Secondly, considering the safety issue during autonomous path following process, a constraint function is designed in the proposed scheme to limit the lateral displacement error, and then the relevant stability proof of the closed-loop control scheme is carried out. Finally, the validation is implemented under both simulation and experiment environment, the results show that the proposed control scheme is effective to different working conditions, and maximum lateral displacement error 0.0297 m of the studied test vehicle proves the proposed control scheme is feasible. The proposed scheme might provide a theoretical reference for control practice of actual vehicle."
8961203,Robust LMI-Based H-Infinite Controller Integrating AFS and DYC of Autonomous Vehicles With Parametric Uncertainties,"Autonomous vehicles’ dynamics stability control is one key issue to ensure safety of self-driving. However, vehicle uncertainties and time-varying parameters could weaken the performance of autonomous vehicle stability control. Therefore, this article proposes a novel robust linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based
H
-infinite feedback algorithm for vehicle dynamics stability control, and this algorithm controls vehicle steering system and brake system via direct yaw moment control (DYC) and active front steering control (AFS). The presented controller is robust against vehicle parametric uncertainties, including the vehicle mass and vehicle longitudinal velocity. A linear parameter varying lateral model is constructed utilizing polytopic uncertainty method considering time-varying vehicle longitudinal velocity and mass, where a polytope that contains finite vertices is established to contain all of the possible selections for uncertainty parameters. Then, the
H
-infinite feedback controller integrating DYC and AFS is derived via LMI technique. Finally, experimental results based on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform illustrate that the presented controller has better performance of ensuring autonomous vehicle dynamics stability than other controllers."
8948288,DenseLightNet: A Light-Weight Vehicle Detection Network for Autonomous Driving,"In recent years, vehicle detectors built on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) have been widely used in autonomous driving. Under the complex conditions of road traffic, the detector is expected to run in high speed and high accuracy. However, due to the limited computing power and storage space on the autonomous vehicle, the deployment of advanced DCNN detectors is often restricted. The design of lightweight and powerful detectors is in a great desire. Recently, group convolution, as a novel convolution algorithm, has been proposed to reduce the floating-point operations and make the detection network lighter and faster. However, in practice, it is found that the increase of group number does not always boost the detection speed, but sometimes leads to the performance degradation. In addition, the existing guidelines for network design do not indicate how to choose the group number in the group convolution in order to maximize the overall detection speed. To this end, in this paper, we propose three new guidelines to determine the valid range of the group number, and design a lightweight detection network-DenseLightNet-based on these new design criteria. The proposed detector runs at a speed of three times faster than the current real-time detector YoloV3, while holding a much smaller model size."
8540792,Automation Kit for Dual-Mode Military Unmanned Ground Vehicle for Surveillance Missions,"The field of autonomous vehicles is an area of great importance nowadays among Intelligent Transport Systems. These autonomous vehicles must meet high standards of robustness, safety and protection to make autonomous driving safer than human driving, thus improving current accident rates and energy efficiency, so its complete implementation in the market is expected in the long term. However, there are other areas, such as the agricultural and military sectors, where the demand for technologies related to autonomous driving is also high but the applicability could be faster. In this sense, the unmanned ground military vehicles (UGV) are a technology available in international armies for some years, but that is still subject to a series of technical, logistical and material limitations that reduce its applicability. This paper presents an automation kit for transforming military service vehicles into military UGVs, developed through the transfer of autonomous vehicle technology from the civil sector to the military sector. This kit has been installed in a quite common vehicle of the Spanish army, in order to provide two functional capabilities: autonomous navigation and teleoperation, in off-road environments with minimal or no traffic marks or infrastructure aids. The vehicle equipped with this kit is oriented to different missions such as circulation in convoys, operation as tele-operated probe vehicle and perimeter surveillance. The automation kit involves no permanent modifications in the vehicle that can be driven manually when desired, allows vehicles to be used both in missions in conflict zones and to support operations in emergencies and natural catastrophes, and can be easily installed in any kind of vehicle."
9270054,Noble Proposition For Autonomous Detection Of Obstacles By Vehicles Using the Concept of Light Fidelity,The modern day autonomous vehicles more popularly known as the self driving vehicles use the concepts of computer vision. Our works aim to provide a hardware based solution towards the problem of object detection using the concept of light fidelity (Li-Fi). The system as proposed here will be able to intelligently distinguish between vehicles and the other inanimate obstacles like a broken tree or a fallen lamp post. This system works on the output from two subsystems- the ultrasound based system and the Li-Fi module. The output from both the systems are then compared to arrive at the conclusion whether or not the said object is a vehicle or simply an instance of road block. This concept is not only restricted to self driving vehicles but also extendable to any modern day manually driven vehicle.
9229409,Oil Plume Mapping: Adaptive Tracking and Adaptive Sampling From an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"We have developed an adaptive sampling algorithm for an Explorer autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to conduct in-situ analysis of acoustic measurements to perform autonomous oil plume detection and tracking. The methodology of the tracking phase involves ongoing analysis of the detected plume, assessing target validity and proximity for AUV decision-making for plume mapping. We previously introduced the bumblebee flight path, a new biomimetic search pattern designed to maximize the spatial coverage in the oil plume detection phase. This paper focuses on a new tracking strategy as the key adaptive stage in our plume delineation. For initial development we used a 360-degree scanning sonar sensor model. Simulations were done with different plume models to assess the performance of the developed adaptive sampling algorithm. A convergence study demonstrated that the algorithm could successfully track the boundary of a non-regular shaped/patchy oil plume at up to a 0.05Hz sampling frequency. A sensitivity study identified the correlations between plume feature complexity and the anticipated range of acoustic measurement update delays. The decision-making architecture consists of three separate components which implements either proximity or boundary following control and contributes to the final decision on the next desired heading of the vehicle. A weight ratio, that determined the relative allocation of each component, was varied to study its impact on the tracking performance of the AUV. The novelty of our approach is in addressing the discontinuous and patchy nature of realistic oil plumes. Our sampling algorithm and its performance in simulations is a significant step beyond the practical limitations of existing gradient-following methods because it accounts for the oil patches and droplets which gradient-following algorithms do not."
9013088,2D Estimation of Velocity Relative to Water and Tidal Currents Based on Differential Pressure for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Reliable navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) depends on the quality of their state estimation. Providing robust velocity estimation thus plays an important role. While water currents are main contributors to the navigational uncertainty of AUVs, they are also an important variable for oceanographic research. For both reasons, water current estimation is desirable during AUV operations. State of the art velocity estimation relies on expensive acoustic sensors with considerable energy requirements and a large form factor such as Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) and Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), while water currents are either estimated with the same sensors, or with algorithms that require accurate position feedback. In this letter, we introduce a low-cost, lightweight and energy efficient sensor (DPSSv2) to estimate fluid relative velocity in 2D based on differential pressure. The sensor is validated in field trials on-board an AUV in the presence of tidal currents. We further show that, while moving against the currents, our device is capable of estimating tidal currents in situ with comparable accuracy to a DVL, given a source for absolute vehicle velocity. Additionally, we establish the limitations of the current design of DPSSv2 while moving with the currents."
9575925,LiDAR-based Object Detection Failure Tolerated Autonomous Driving Planning System,"A typical autonomous driving system usually relies on the detected objects from an environment perception module. Current research still cannot guarantee a perfect perception, and failure detections may cause collisions, leading to untrustworthy autonomous vehicles. This work proposes a trajectory planner to tolerate the detection failure of the LiDAR sensors. This method will plan the path relying on the detected objects as well as the raw sensor data. The overlapping and contradiction of both perception routes will be carefully addressed for safe and efficient driving. The object detector in this work uses a deep learning-based method, i.e., CNN-Segmentation neural network. The designed trajectory planner has multi-layers to handle the multi-resolution environment formed by different perception routes. The final system will dynamically adjust its attention to the detected objects or the point cloud to avoid collision due to detection failures. This method is implemented on a real autonomous vehicle to drive in an open urban area. The results show that when the autonomous vehicle fails to detect a surrounding object, e.g., vehicles or some undefined objects, the autonomous vehicles still can plan an efficient and safe trajectory. In the meantime, when the perception system works well, the A V will not be affected by the point clouds. This technology can make the autonomous vehicle trustworthy even with the black-box neural networks. The codes are open-source with our autonomous driving platform to help other researchers for A V development."
9536764,Model Predictive Control With Learned Vehicle Dynamics for Autonomous Vehicle Path Tracking,"Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is a capable technique for designing Path Tracking Controller (PTC) of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). The performance of MPC can be significantly enhanced by adopting a high-fidelity and accurate vehicle model. This model should be capable of capturing the full dynamics of the vehicle, including nonlinearities and uncertainties, without imposing a high computational cost for MPC. A data-driven approach realised by learning vehicle dynamics using vehicle operation data can offer a promising solution by providing a suitable trade-off between accurate state predictions and the computational cost for MPC. This work proposes a framework for designing an MPC with a Neural Network (NN)-based learned dynamic model of the vehicle using the plethora of data available from modern vehicle systems. The objective is to integrate an NN-based model with higher accuracy than the conventional vehicle models for the required prediction horizon into MPC for improved tracking performances. The proposed NN-based model is highly capable of approximating latent system states, which are difficult to estimate, and provides more accurate predictions in the presence of parametric uncertainties. The results in various road conditions show that the proposed approach outperforms the MPCs with conventional vehicle models."
9307415,User Requirements for Autonomous Vehicles – a Comparative Analysis of Expert and Non-expert-based Approach,"Given the rapid progress being made in the design and development of autonomous vehicles, society is reaching the situation whereby customers will be able to access a range of semi-autonomous vehicles. These vehicles have the capability to drive autonomously in certain circumstances, with minimal input from the driver, except situations when a Request to Intervene is issued. While user requirements differ across and between types of users, there is no unified set of user requirements which will be acceptable to all drivers. Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around autonomous mobility, the authors made an attempt to extract, rank and compare the requirements that should be met according to different types of users - experts and non-experts. An initial set of user requirements was obtained, recognizing that drivers will have different priorities and preferences in this most critical of handover scenarios."
9208241,Integrated Framework of Autonomous Vehicle with Traffic Sign Recognition in Simulation Environment,"This study proposes an integrated framework for autonomous vehicle research in a simulated environment. There has been much research on the simulations of vehicles and environments, the recognition of traffic signs, and the lateral/longitudinal controls of a vehicle. Yet, not many systems are available for autonomous vehicle researchers to test and improve their algorithms in a realistic simulated environment with sensor suites in their own car model. We aim to provide an integrated framework for a programmable autonomous vehicle in a simulated environment. The simulated vehicle is capable of autonomous driving with traffic sign recognition using deep learning-based object detection capability as well as lateral and longitudinal controllers. To show the feasibility of the proposed system, we built a simulated robotic vehicle with an environment where traffic signs are placed alongside a road. We also integrated a module for object detection and recognition to determine the longitudinal behavior of the vehicle. In addition, the current study implemented a lateral controller based on a convolutional neural network for the vehicle to make it drive by itself. We believe that the proposed integrated framework can be utilized by researchers and educators and lower entry barriers in the prosperous autonomous vehicle research."
9389144,Rendezvous of Networked Autonomous Underwater Vehicles in 3D Space,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used in 3D marine environments for oceanographic inquiry. Once AUVs have finished their tasks, they are often required to return to a common destination to dock or exchange information. To achieve the rendezvous of a group of AUVs, a distributed controller is designed by taking into account the vehicle 3D nonholonomic constraints and the entire group network connectivity. Each AUV considered in this study has 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) and can move longitudinally freely along with roll, pitch and yaw rates but not laterally and vertically as imposed by vehicle nonholonomic kinematics. The group of AUVs is networked based on a directed spanning graph to enable group-level communication and collaboration capabilities. It is critical that the network of the group always be preserved during all AUV motions to avoid communication and collaboration failures. The designed distributed controller is based on a dipolar navigation function that generates potential forces to align the AUV configurations with the common destination and to enable the group vehicle-to-vehicle distances to be maintained. This ultimately results in the group network to be continually connected. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the ability and effectiveness of the proposed distributed controller to steer a group of AUVs to achieve rendezvous."
9627603,Semantic Point Cloud-Based Adaptive Multiple Object Detection and Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles,"LiDAR-based Multiple Object Detection and Tracking (MODT) is one of the essential tasks in autonomous driving. Since MODT is directly related to the safety of an autonomous vehicle, it is critical to provide reliable information about the surrounding objects. For that reason, we propose a semantic point cloud-based adaptive MODT system for autonomous driving. Semantic point clouds emerge with advances in deep learning-based Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation (PCSS), which assigns semantic information to each point in the point cloud of LiDAR. This semantic information provides several advantages to the MODT system. First, any point corresponding to any static object can be filtered. Because the class information assigned to each point can be directly utilized, filtering is possible without any modeling. Second, the class information of an object can be inferred without any special classification process because the class information is provided from the semantic point cloud. Finally, the clustering and tracking module can consider unique dimensional and dynamic characteristics based on class information. We utilize the Carla simulator and KITTI dataset to verify our method by comparing several existing algorithms. In conclusion, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is improved by about 176% on average compared to the existing algorithm."

9537063,Comparison of PPO and SAC Algorithms Towards Decision Making Strategies for Collision Avoidance Among Multiple Autonomous Vehicles,"Multiple vehicle collision avoidance strategies with safe lane changing strategy for vehicle control using learning base technique are the most crucial concern in autonomous driving system. Statistics shows that the latest autonomous driving systems are usually prone to rear-end collision. Rear-end collisions often result in severe injuries as well as traffic jam and the consequences are much worse for multiple-vehicle collision. Many previous autonomous driving research focused solely on collision avoidance strategies for two consecutive vehicles. This study proposes a centralised control strategy for multiple vehicles using reinforcement learning focused on partner consideration and goal attainment. The system depicted as a group of vehicles are communicate and coordinate each others by a set of rays and maintain a short following move away. In order to address this challenge, a simulation was implemented in the Unity3D game engine and two state-of-the-art RL algorithms PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) were trained by an agent using Unity ML-Agents Toolkit. In terms of success rate, performance, training speed and stability two algorithms are comparable. The potency of algorithms has been assessed by the traffic flow (1) change in vehicle speed, (2) differ in the vehicle beginning positions, and (3) switch to next lane. The agent performed similarly at a 91% success rate in PPO or SAC applications"
9281414,Electric Autonomous Vehicle Charging and Parking Coordination for Vehicle-to-Grid Voltage Regulation with Renewable Energy,"Power system operators face challenges of the increasing penetration level of renewable energy sources (RESs) such as out-of-limit voltage problems in distribution networks. Vehicle-to-Grid is one of the promising technologies to mitigate the voltage fluctuations by using the battery storage of electric vehicles (EVs). On the other hand, the autonomous vehicle (AV) is believed to be the next generation transport that can navigate on the road without active control of human driver. Full autonomy of AVs actuated by electric battery supports additional advantages over the ordinary EV. In this paper, we aim at coordinating the charging and parking schedule of a fleet of electric AVs to mitigate voltage variations in the power system. We formulate the charging and parking coordination problem as a mixed integer quadratic program (MIQP), which can be solved by a standard MIQP solver. Simulation on a modified 15-bus distribution system is performed and the results show that it is effective to regulate voltage by incorporating a limited number of EAVs based on our model."
8454768,Resilience to Intentional Electromagnetic Interference Is Required for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"The connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) will never be completely autonomous; on the contrary, it will be heavily dependent on so-called vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) for its function. To deserve the trust of the general public, the vehicles as well as the intelligent transport system (ITS) infrastructure must be able to handle not only natural disturbances but also attacks of malicious nature. In this paper, we discuss the effects of antagonistic attacks using intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) and how the antagonistic nature of the threat renders probabilistic risk analysis inadequate for the defense of the vehicles and the infrastructure. Instead, we propose a shift toward resilience engineering and vulnerability analysis to manage antagonistic threats. Finally, we also give two examples of possible scenarios to illustrate the type of situations a CAV must be able to handle."
9092119,Optimization of Higher-Order Sliding Mode Control Parameter using Particle Swarm Optimization for Lateral Dynamics of Autonomous Vehicles,"In this paper, we develop a strategy for lateral control of an autonomous vehicle using a higher-order sliding mode control by the super-twisting algorithm. We minimize the lateral displacement of the autonomous vehicle to a reference trajectory. And more particularly we used a Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the Control parameters of the higher-order Sliding Mode. In the simulation, We have followed two scenarios, the first is to optimize the sliding surface parameter and the second scenario based on the optimization of the control parameters. In this system the command input is the steering angle and the output is the lateral error. The simulation show that the control results by higher-order sliding mode control with parameters optimization PSO are better than those of the control by sliding mode control random."
9107464,A Framework for Self-Enforced Interaction Between Connected Vehicles: Intersection Negotiation,"This paper proposes an algorithm for resolution of traffic conflicts occurring on an intersection, intended for Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV). The algorithm is based on the trade-off between energy consumption and user-defined value of time. The consequent cooperation opportunities originating from agent heterogeneity are captured by a game-theoretic cooperative-competitive solution approach to develop a computationally feasible, self-enforced, cooperative intersection de-conflicting algorithm. It is intended as a component of a robust framework for strategic control of the vehicle’s powertrain. Monte Carlo simulation is used to showcase the decision-making algorithm’s behaviour, to estimate its efficiency as a function of traffic heterogeneity. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm may offer threefold improvement in energy and time efficiency in relation to a First Come First Served scheme."
8723564,Hardware-in-the-Loop Autonomous Driving Simulation Without Real-Time Constraints,"Simulation is a cornerstone of autonomous driving efforts, allowing testing to occur more rapidly and with significantly less risk than is possible with hardware platforms alone. Simulation systems must be able to emulate a variety of sensors including cameras and LiDARs in order to allow high-level software such as image processing and path planning to be tested. In this paper, we present a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system without real-time constraints. It is based on CARLA to give access to the sensors required to test high-level software, and incorporates compute hardware identical to that used on an autonomous vehicle platform in order to provide realistic constraints regarding available processing power. In addition, we explore the robot operating system based software framework used on the Formula SAE vehicle and its integration with the driving simulator. Finally, we validate the sensor outputs and vehicle dynamics of the simulated system against a physical autonomous driving hardware platform."

9185078,A Novel Deep Q-Learning-Based Air-Assisted Vehicular Caching Scheme for Safe Autonomous Driving,"The safety driving-related content demands of vehicle users increase rapidly, especially with the development of autonomous driving. It is significantly necessary to obtain the safety-related transportation information of an area when vehicles are drove there, whether or not they are controlled by human being. However, vehicular content caching can bring issues in distributed-fashion, such as high response delay and low content response ratio because of the poor traffic condition and the obstructions of buildings. As a consequence, we adopt UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to assist the driving safety-related content caching for vehicles. Besides, since the power energy and the caching storage of UAVs are limited, it is needed to design an optimal caching scheme to guarantee the driving safety-related content demands of vehicle users as well as reduce the energy consumption of UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel deep Q-learning based air-assisted vehicular caching scheme to respond to the driving safety-related content requests of vehicle users. First, a three-layered content response architecture is introduced, where an airship is leveraged to take charge of the scheduling of UAVs to improve the content response. Then, a multi-objective mathematical model is built to describe the specific problem of the proposed scheme. Finally, deep Q-learning is applied to solve the multi-objective problem by learning from the history content requests of vehicle users. Extensive experiments have been conducted which show the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of content hit ratio, response delay, being scheduling probability and packet buffering time."
8617711,Crash Mitigation in Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles,"A motion planning method for autonomous vehicles confronting emergency situations where collision is inevitable, generating a path to mitigate the crash as much as possible, is proposed in this paper. The Model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is adopted here for motion planning. If avoidance is impossible for the model predictive motion planning system, the potential crash severity, and artificial potential field are filled into the controller objective to achieve general obstacle avoidance and the lowest crash severity. Furthermore, the vehicle dynamic is also considered as an optimal control problem. Based on the analysis mentioned earlier, the model predictive controller can optimize the command following, obstacle avoidance, vehicle dynamics, road regulation, and mitigate the inevitable crash based on the predicted values. The proposed MPC algorithm has been proved by simulation to have the ability to avoid obstacles and mitigate the crash if collision is inevitable."
9733973,Scenario Understanding and Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles - Review and Comparison,"Scenario understanding and motion prediction are essential components for completely replacing human drivers and for enabling highly and fully automated driving (SAE-Level 4/5). In deeply stochastic and uncertain traffic scenarios, autonomous driving software must act beyond existing traffic rules and must predict critical situations in advance to provide safe and comfortable rides. In addition, comprehensive prediction models intend not just to reproduce, but rather to encode the human driver behavior, which requires profound scenario understanding. Hence, research in the field of scenario understanding and motion prediction also contributes to enable intelligent driver behavior models in general. This paper aims to review the state of research and outline common methods. A classification of these models is proposed according to their underlying investigation methodology. Based on this classification, a comparison is drawn between three specific prediction methods, which considers specific functional aspects and general requirements of applicability. The results of the comparison reveal a trade-off between holism and explainability in the state of the art. In conclusion, suggestions for future research objectives to solve this conflict are proposed."
8733620,An Hierarchical Architecture for Docking Autonomous Surface Vehicles,"Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) provide the ideal platform to further explore the many opportunities in the cargo shipping industry, by making it more profitable and safer. This paper presents an architecture for the autonomous docking operation, formed by two stages: a maneuver module and, a situational awareness system to detect a mooring facility where an ASV can safely dock. Information retrieved from a 3D LIDAR, IMU and GPS are combined to extract the geometric features of the floating platform and to estimate the relative positioning and orientation of the moor to the ASV. Then, the maneuver module plans a trajectory to a specific position and guarantees that the ASV will not collide with the mooring facility. The approach presented in this paper was validated in distinct environmental and weather conditions such as tidal waves and wind. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed architecture for detecting the docking platform and safely conduct the navigation towards it, achieving errors up to 0.107 m in position and 6.S8°in orientation."

This chapter discusses the evolution of vehicle‐to‐everything technology (V2X) and presents several usage cases of V2X for autonomous driving. Cooperative autonomous driving can be divided into two categories: cooperative sensing and cooperative decision. Cooperative sensing focuses on sharing sensing information between vehicle‐to‐vehicle and vehicle‐to‐infrastructure. This data sharing can increase the sensing range of autonomous vehicles, making the system more robust. The cooperative decision enables a group of autonomous vehicles to cooperate and make decisions. Some studies have focused on the exploration of applications for cooperative autonomous driving. The chapter demonstrates four use cases including convoy driving, cooperative lane change, cooperative intersection management, and cooperative sensing. There are several challenges in achieving cooperative autonomous driving. The chapter explores the challenges and our vision for application scenario of cooperative decision and cooperative sensing."
9277298,Lane Level Path Planning for Urban Autonomous Driving using Vector Map,"In the past decade, autonomous vehicles have received remarkable attention for the efficiency and safety of road traffic. For more advanced autonomous driving systems, the importance of vector maps containing location information on various objects, such as multi-lane, centerlines of the lanes, traffic signs and signals, etc. is becoming increasingly important. However, until now, vector maps are mainly used to increase localization accuracy by using perception results or visualization of the driving environment. In this study, we propose a lane level path planning method using vector maps. The proposed lane level path planning method is designed to increase path planning efficiency and flexibility by searching the global route and lane level route to destination hierarchically. In addition, techniques for minimizing manual annotation, which has been a barrier to the use of vector maps, have also been proposed. The validity of the proposed method was verified through a test using a real lane-level road network."
9298480,SA-YOLOv3: An Efficient and Accurate Object Detector Using Self-Attention Mechanism for Autonomous Driving,"Object detection is becoming increasingly significant for autonomous-driving system. However, poor accuracy or low inference performance limits current object detectors in applying to autonomous driving. In this work, a fast and accurate object detector termed as SA-YOLOv3, is proposed by introducing dilated convolution and self-attention module (SAM) into the architecture of YOLOv3. Furthermore, loss function based on GIoU and focal loss is reconstructed to further optimize detection performance. With an input size of 512x 512, our proposed SA-YOLOv3 improves YOLOv3 by 2.58 mAP and 2.63 mAP on KITTI and BDD100K benchmarks, with real-time inference (more than 40 FPS). When compared with other state-of-the-art detectors, it reports better trade-off in terms of detection accuracy and speed, indicating the suitability for autonomous-driving application. To our best knowledge, it is the first method that incorporates YOLOv3 with attention mechanism, and we expect this work would guide for autonomous-driving research in the future."
8957685,Smoothing Traffic Flow via Control of Autonomous Vehicles,"The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is expected to revolutionize road transportation in the near future. Although large-scale numerical simulations and small-scale experiments have shown promising results, a comprehensive theoretical understanding to smooth traffic flow via AVs is lacking. In this article, from a control-theoretic perspective, we establish analytical results on the controllability, stabilizability, and reachability of a mixed traffic system consisting of human-driven vehicles and AVs in a ring road. We show that the mixed traffic system is not completely controllable, but is stabilizable, indicating that AVs can not only suppress unstable traffic waves but also guide the traffic flow to a higher speed. Accordingly, we establish the maximum traffic speed achievable via controlling AVs. Numerical results show that the traffic speed can be increased by over 6% when there are only 5% AVs. We also design an optimal control strategy for AVs to actively dampen undesirable perturbations. These theoretical findings validate the high potential of AVs to smooth traffic flow."

This paper presents a solution for longitudinal motion speed control of autonomous vehicle. The primary objective is to achieve a smooth and safe control of speed for autonomous vehicle. This is accomplished by the design of Model Predictive Controller (MPC) which controls the speed by taking inputs from LIDAR module. The longitudinal motion of vehicle is controlled by taking into consideration the factors such as obstacles, lead vehicles and pedestrians. This leads to smooth acceleration and deceleration in various situations. The proposed system works effectively for both low and high-speed vehicles. The performance of the controller was evaluated for parameters like sample time, prediction horizon using Matlab simulations, and implemented experimentally on autonomous vehicle prototype."
8701385,Optimizing Autonomous Vehicles to Prevent On-Road Congestion,"Autonomous vehicles are making their way into our lives and their very existence will cause many probable ripples that will eventually require constant improvement and refinement. This research paper proposes an implication of such technology that could eventually save us from on-road difficulties, such as traffic jams, by optimizing the usage of autonomous vehicles.Technology is going to play a key role here, we will use the latent data from Google Maps to receive traffic reports and then use this data to create various levels of alerts to identify and improvise upon the traffic situation. If this idea is implemented, most of us would be able to save a lot of time and money and traffic jams wouldn't be as big a problem as they are today. We have the technology available to us but we are not able to use it fully to automate scenarios where something like traffic jam(s) could become avoidable. Automated vehicles, unlikehumans, are governed by certain instructions/protocols and that makes it easier to use these AVs to drive our future for the better."
9389432,Particle Filter based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation System aided thru acoustic communication ranging,"Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are platforms suitable for a wide variety of applications in the marine environment with economic and operational advantages. In these applications an AUV performs a given task as a mission. During the mission execution, the AUV will move around the environment following paths that allow it to fulfill the mission's objectives. To achieve this, a reliable Navigation System (NS) is required. In addition to this, the current operating concept includes the deployment of multiple AUVs on a given area, thus a communication system between vehicles is also required. In the underwater environment both navigation and communication systems deals with the particular characteristics of the medium that limits the use of conventional techniques. In this work, a complete NS for an AUV is presented. The developed NS is based on an inertial navigation scheme with velocity and position aiding.

This paper focuses on a search- and-track (SAT) mission for an underwater target, and the mission is implemented by combining an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In the cooperative path planning model, the mission is divided into the search phase and the track phase, and the goals of the two phases are to maximize the search space and minimize the terminal error respectively. The constraints contain the maneuverability of vehicles and communication ranges between vehicles. Strategies based on random simulation experiments and asynchronous planning are developed to design the cooperative path planning algorithm in the two phases, and the paths are generated by an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm in a centralized or a distributed mode. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can deal with different situations. The UAV&USV&AUV system is superior to the USV&AUV system in the SAT mission."

Since real-world testing is expensive and safety-critical - especially when facing dynamic racing scenarios at the limit of handling - a favored approach is simulation-based testing. In this work, we pro-pose an open-source graphical user interface, which allows the generation of a multi-vehicle scenario in a regular or even a race environment. The under-lying method and implementation is elaborated in detail. Furthermore, we showcase the potential use-cases for the scenario-based validation of a safety assessment module, integrated into an autonomous driving software stack. Within this scope, we introduce three illustrative scenarios, each focusing on a different safety-critical aspect."
9443169,Efficient Local Navigation Approach for Autonomous Driving Vehicles,"This paper presents an efficient and practical approach for a car navigation system (CVM-Car) based on the velocity space optimization paradigm. The method calculates the velocity control commands to keep the car in the lane while avoiding the obstacles detected by the proximity sensors. The car has to follow a road path consisting of a sequence of lanelets. This approach is a lower-level reactive control that combines the pure pursuit method to obtain a reference curvature and a reactive control algorithm that keeps the vehicle in the center of the lane' s free space while avoiding obstacles that can partially block it. CVM-Car formulates local obstacle avoidance as a constrained optimization problem in the velocity space of the car. In addition to the vehicle dynamics and obstacles constraints included by the curvature method, car-shape and non-holonomic restrictions are considered in the CVM-Car velocity space. The method has been applied to an autonomous vehicle prototype."
8818343,No Blind Spots: Full-Surround Multi-Object Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles Using Cameras and LiDARs,"Online multi-object tracking (MOT) is extremely important for high-level spatial reasoning and path planning for autonomous and highly-automated vehicles. In this paper, we present a modular framework for tracking multiple objects (vehicles), capable of accepting object proposals from different sensor modalities (vision and range) and a variable number of sensors, to produce continuous object tracks. This work is a generalization of the MDP framework for MOT proposed by Xiang et al., with some key extensions - First, we track objects across multiple cameras and across different sensor modalities. This is done by fusing object proposals across sensors accurately and efficiently. Second, the objects of interest (targets) are tracked directly in the real world. This is a departure from traditional techniques where objects are simply tracked in the image plane. Doing so allows the tracks to be readily used by an autonomous agent for navigation and related tasks. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we test it on real world highway data collected from a heavily sensorized testbed capable of capturing full-surround information. We demonstrate that our framework is well-suited to track objects through entire maneuvers around the ego-vehicle, some of which take more than a few minutes to complete. We also leverage the modularity of our approach by comparing the effects of including/excluding different sensors, changing the total number of sensors, and the quality of object proposals on the final tracking result."
8910371,Looking at the Driver/Rider in Autonomous Vehicles to Predict Take-Over Readiness,"Continuous estimation the driver's take-over readiness is critical for safe and timely transfer of control during the failure modes of autonomous vehicles. In this article, we propose a data-driven approach for estimating the driver's take-over readiness based purely on observable cues from in-vehicle vision sensors. We present an extensive naturalistic driving dataset of drivers in a conditionally autonomous vehicle running on Californian freeways. We collect subjective ratings for the driver's take-over readiness from multiple human observers viewing the sensor feed. Analysis of the ratings in terms of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) shows a high degree of consistency in the ratings across raters. We define a metric for the driver's take-over readiness termed the `Observable Readiness Index (ORI)' based on the ratings. Finally, we propose an LSTM model for continuous estimation of the driver's ORI based on a holistic representation of the driver's state, capturing gaze, hand, pose and foot activity. Our model estimates the ORI with a mean absolute error of 0.449 on a 5 point scale."

In this paper, a filter-based secure dynamic pose estimation approach is proposed such that the vehicle pose can be resilient under the possible sensor attacks. Our proposed estimator coincides with the conventional Kalman filter when all sensors on autonomous vehicles are benign. If less than half of the measurement states are compromised by the randomly occurring deception attacks, it still gives stable estimates of the pose states, i.e., an upper bound for the estimation error covariance is guaranteed. The pose estimation results with single and multiple attacks on the testing route validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach."
9304808,On The Manipulation of Wheel Speed Sensors and Their Impact in Autonomous Vehicles,"Modern vehicles and in particular automated or autonomous vehicles utilize data gained from wheel speed sensors for various functionalities like determining current speed or electronic stability control. The wheel speed is derived from a multitude of hall sensors. By generating an electromagnetic field with a fitting frequency it is possible to change the wheel speed sensor's interpretation of wheel speed. The braking system and electronic stability control would then base their actions on incorrect data possibly leading to a dangerous situation. In this research, we investigate practical feasibility and impact of such attacks. For this, an audio amplifier and a Helmholtz coil were used to emit electromagnetic fields with varying frequencies. We then analyse the effect of a single manipulated wheel speed sensor on the electronic stability control used in modern vehicles (using a hardware-in-the-loop setup). We finally describe consequences and possible countermeasure for the upcoming autonomous and highly automated vehicles."
9557770,Novel Decision-Making Strategy for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles in Highway On-Ramp Merging,"High-speed highway on-ramp merging is a significant challenge toward realizing fully automated driving (level 4). Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), that combine communication and autonomous driving technologies, may improve greatly the safety performances when performing highway on-ramp merging. However, even with the emergence of CAVs, some keys constraints should be considered to achieve a safe on-ramp merging. First, human-driven vehicles will still be present on the road, and it may take decades before all the commercialized vehicles will be fully autonomous and connected. Also, onboard vehicle sensors may provide inaccurate or incomplete data due to sensors limitations and blind spots, especially in such critical situations. To resolve these issues, the present work introduces a novel solution that uses an off-board Road-Side Unit (RSU) to realize fully automated highway on-ramp merging for connected and automated vehicles. Our proposed approach is based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict drivers' intentions. This prediction is used as an input state to a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that outputs the longitudinal acceleration for the merging vehicle. To achieve this, we first propose a data-driven model that can predict the behavior of the human-driven vehicles in the main highway lane, with 99% accuracy. We use the output of this model as input state to train a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3) agent that learns ``safe'' and ``cooperative'' driving policy to perform highway on-ramp merging. We show that our proposed decision-making strategy improves performance compared to the solutions proposed previously."

9712351,"Joint Optimization of Sensing, Decision-making and Motion-controlling for Autonomous Vehicles: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach","The three main modules of autonomous vehicles, i.e., sensing, decision making, and motion controlling, have been studied separately in most existing works on autonomous driving, which overlook the correlations among these modules, leading to a result of unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that first tactfully processes the sensing data, then jointly learns and optimizes the decision-making and motion-controlling using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the proposed scheme designs a novel state representation mechanism, where the sensing data goes through the attention layer and the convolutional neural network (CNN) layer sequentially. The attention layer focuses on extracting the most important local information and then CNN layer takes a broad view to comprehensively consider the global information for a better representation. Furthermore, the proposed scheme jointly learns decision-making and motion-controlling, therefore, the relevance of these two modules is implicitly considered, which helps to achieve a better autonomous driving policy. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme is better than classic control methods and some RL methods in terms of safety, velocity, etc. We also demonstrate the respective functions of the attention layer and the CNN layer through ablation studies. Finally, we construct a traffic scene with a real autonomous vehicle, and verified the feasibility of the proposed scheme."

Firstly, the combined vehicle-path model is established. To ensure the real-time performance of MPC, the coupling relationships in the control output and the longitudinal/lateral motions are well decoupled, in this way a linear integrated model is utilized as the internal model of the controller. Then, the holistic MPC is proposed to acquire the steering angle and the force on each corner. Based on the advantages of the proposed structure, a weight adaptive mechanism is introduced to improve the handling ability of the controller to various driving conditions, especially some extreme conditions. For the uncertainties in tire cornering stiffness, a multiple-model adaptive law is designed with its convergence proved by Lyapunov theory.

8410770,A Novel Fuzzy Observer-Based Steering Control Approach for Path Tracking in Autonomous Vehicles,"In this paper, the problem of steering control is investigated for vehicle path tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties and nonlinearities. In practice, the vehicle mass varies due to the number of passengers or amount of payload, while the vehicle velocity also changes during normal cruising, which significantly influences vehicle dynamics. Moreover, the vehicle dynamics are strongly nonlinear caused by the tire/road forces under different road surface conditions. With fuzzy modeling method, the original nonlinear path tracking system with parameter variations is first formulated as a T-S fuzzy model with additive norm-bounded uncertainties, and then an approach to the fuzzy observer-based output feedback steering control for vehicle dynamics is proposed under a fuzzy Lyapunov function framework. By employing matrix inequality convexifying techniques, a sufficient condition is developed in the form of linear matrix inequalities such that the closed-loop path tracking error system is asymptotically stable with a guaranteed H ∞ level. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy observer-based output feedback controller is demonstrated in Carsim/Matlab joint simulation environment, via which the advantage of a T-S fuzzy observer-based output controller over the closed-loop driver model embedded in Carsim is also shown with parametric uncertainties and nonlinearities."

To improve the prediction accuracy, triggering time and physical constraints are included in the predictor. Numerical simulations are utilized to validate the predictor. The effects of uncertain human reaction delays, time-varying parameters of human-driven vehicles, and stochastic packet drops in V2V communication on the accuracy of the RLS prediction are also investigated."

This disruptive technology is likely to enhance the way we get around the city in many ways by collecting accurate data in regards to the surrounding environment and events in a timely-manner. As such data that is time-sensitive where human life may be at risk requires reliable and on-time data delivery.

8922778,Target Vehicle Motion Prediction-Based Motion Planning Framework for Autonomous Driving in Uncontrolled Intersections,"This paper presents a motion-planning framework for urban autonomous driving at uncontrolled intersections. The intention and future state of the target vehicles are predicted using information obtained from the environment sensors. The target state prediction module employs an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filter to infer the intention of targets. The prediction results of each model of the IMM filter are fused to predict the future state of targets. The proposed predictor uses the intelligent driver model based-driver behavior model to construct the local filter of IMM. The driving mode decision is realized as a state machine consisting of two phases, `Approach' and `Risk Management'. The risk management phase is composed of two sub-modes, `Cross' and `Yield'. The state transition conditions between phases and modes are defined by introducing the concepts of `Critical gap' and `Follow-up gap'. Based on the determined driving mode, the motion planning module consists of two sub-modules for each phase. The required deceleration determination for the approach phase is proposed to consider the occluded region in order to prevent inevitable collisions caused by fast approaches. The model predictive controller for the risk management phase is designed to determine the desired acceleration to guarantee safety and prevent unnecessary deceleration simultaneously. Both computer simulation studies and vehicle tests are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. The results indicate that the proposed framework ensures the safety at uncontrolled intersections with a driving pattern similar to that of a driver."

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination.

8788688,"Evidential-Based Approach for Trajectory Planning With Tentacles, for Autonomous Vehicles","Driving is a combination of continuous mental risk assessment, sensory awareness, and judgment, all adapting to extremely variable surrounding conditions. Several research projects are working on autonomous vehicle to robotize this complex task. The work presented in this paper focuses on reactive local trajectory planning in uncertain environment. The environment uncertainty is one of the challenges that we face in trajectory planning. For autonomous vehicle, to be efficient, they need to be able to deal with this kind of uncertainty. In this paper, we show that the theory of belief functions with its ability to distinguish between different types of uncertainty is able to provide significant advantages in the context of trajectory planning. Using the belief functions, we build evidential grid that represents the surrounding environment. To plan a local trajectory, we generate a set of clothoid tentacles in the egocentred reference frame related to the ego-vehicle. Those tentacles represent possible trajectories that consider the current dynamical state of the vehicle and make a smooth variation in the vehicle dynamic variables. Once the representation of the environment and the possible trajectories are generated, an evaluation of each trajectory is carried out according to several criteria and the choice of the trajectory is made using the decision formalism of Markov decision process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our evidential approach, we apply it to scenarios where ego-vehicle has to make decision in uncertain dynamical environments, using a driving simulator (SCANeR™ Studio)."
9233841,Efficent Lane Change Path Planning based on Quintic spline for Autonomous Vehicles,"This paper proposes a lane change path planning method for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) driving in structured environments. Due to the complexity of dynamically changing structured environment, the path planner generally requires to generate a safe and smooth path in a short time when changing lanes. Therefore, we propose an efficient lane change path planning method, which can take into account both the curvature and heading angle of the planned path, ensuring the safety and stability of the lane change maneuver. It builds upon existing method using quintic spline with second-order geometric (G 2 -) continuity in a Frenet coordinate system. By calculating the optimal prediction time interval of the lane change maneuver, the heading angle was kept within a safe range. In order to improve the real-time performance, we use road prior information to optimize the selection of sampling points, effectively reducing the number of candidate paths. In addition, beyond the sampling points, the problem of continuous lane change is solved by adding mid-adjust point and target point, so that AVs have the ability to complete complex movements. In an urban environment, the proposed method is tested on our experimental autonomous vehicle equipped with a modular ROS architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can generate complex motion paths efficiently, and the curvature and heading angle of the planned path are continuous, which effectively improves the efficiency and stability of path planning."
9527167,Path-Tracking Considering Yaw Stability With Passivity-Based Control for Autonomous Vehicles,"In this paper, a new passivity-based control approach is designed to improve the robustness and stability of autonomous vehicles in performing path-tracking tasks. A port-Hamiltonian model is a special geometric structure and provides a systematic and insightful framework to describe many physical systems from an energy perspective. The passivity-based control establishes a new and simple structure to achieve the path-tracking task by the port-Hamiltonian structure. Firstly, the path-tracking error system is transformed into a port-Hamiltonian system with the perturbation. The energy-shaping method is utilized to ensure the asymptotic stability, and the stability proof of the closed-loop, path-tracking error system is given. The proposed real-time, passivity-based controller is directly dependent on the passive outputs, which is robust to parameter uncertainties caused by load changes. Moreover, the control performance of steering control will be degraded when the steering angle is saturated. The yaw-moment control is introduced to enhance the driving safety. In the wheel torque distribution, an optimization-based control allocation is designed to minimize the sum of tire loads and to make them more evenly distributed to each tire. Finally, simulations are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim co-simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed strategy under different driving conditions."

The primary actuator is the Differential Tilting Thruster (DTT), where herein its design and characterization is described, this is then followed by how the DTT, the Variable Buoyancy System (VBS), and the moving mass work together to enable both horizontal cruising and vertical diving configurations."
9142420,Exploratory Investigation of Disengagements and Crashes in Autonomous Vehicles Under Mixed Traffic: An Endogenous Switching Regime Framework,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have a large potential to improve traffic safety but also pose some critical challenges. While AVs may help reduce crashes caused by human error, they still may experience failures of technologies and sensing, as well as decision-making errors in a mixed traffic environment. A disengagement refers to an AV transitioning control from autonomous systems to the trained test driver. The safety critical nature of disengagements makes it imperative to analyze disengagements and crashes together. This study analyzes both crashes and disengagements from real-world AV driving in California to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between disengagements and crashes in a mixed traffic environment. A nested logit model was calibrated using three different outcomes: (1) disengagement with a crash, (2) disengagement with no crash, and (3) no disengagement with a crash. Furthermore, endogenous switching regime models were also calibrated to draw distinctions between the relation of disengagements and crashes while accounting for endogeneity effects. The results show that factors related to AV systems (such as software failures) and other roadway participants increase the propensity of a disengagement without a crash. Furthermore, AVs were observed to disengage less often as the technology matured over time. Marginal effects revealed an 8% decrease. The results thus suggest that disengagements are a part of AVs’ safe performance and disengagement alerts may need to be triggered in order to avoid certain failures with current technology."
9160014,Image Processing Mechanism for Augmented Reality based Autonomous Navigation,"This paper proposes a novel image processing mechanism for augmented reality based autonomous navigation system. Autonomous vehicles navigate independently without any sort of human assistance. In order to navigate from one location to another, these systems require assistance in the form of markers i.e., bookmarks or reference points which are pre-determined and already stored in a database. This approach makes it difficult for the vehicle to navigate in an unknown and uncertain environment. Therefore, the proposed system will navigate on its own without any pre-trained dataset. Three types of markers are detected and stored in the intelligent repository by eliminating step by step triviality. Optical flow and image processing techniques have been proposed to detect markers from the real time video frames. This approach is divided into three parts: (i) Marker detection and categorization; (ii) Marker Identification and (iii) Obstacle detection. Obstacles are also detected during run time without any training of dataset. This will result in minimizing the gap between human and machine thinking skills."
9389483,Adaptive Fuzzy PID Controller for A Compact Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"This paper presents an adaptive Fuzzy Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for navigation of an compact autonomous underwater vehicle. The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an under-actuated system with three thrusters and a neutrally buoyant, modular, and close-frame body. Kinematic and dynamic models of the system are presented with parameters estimated from detailed CAD model and Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis. 3D way-point navigation with Line-Of-Sight (LOS) strategy is used in the guidance system for trajectory generation. The proposed model of the AUV is a 4 Degree of Freedom (DOF) coupled non-linear system. A partitioning PID control law is developed to maintain the AUV on the desired trajectory. PID controllers are popular for its simplicity and ease of implementation, but for a dynamic system like AUV, the controller gains have to be tuned for different trajectories. To make the AUV follow various trajectories without specifically tuning the gains for each trajectory, a fuzzy controller is introduced. The Fuzzy controller helps to select proper gains for the PID controller for different paths as required. Both the PID and Fuzzy-PID controllers are developed and simulated in MATLAB SIMULINK for 3D trajectories. It is observed that while the PID controller fails to follow the trajectory with gains not tuned for the path, the Fuzzy-PID controller successfully follows the desired trajectory with the same gain parameters."
8814129,Autonomous Vehicle Path Planning Considering Dwarf or Negative Obstacles,"Autonomous vehicle path planning involves finding a collision-free and kinematic-feasible path from the start to the goal. Evidently, collision-free and kinematic-feasible are the two most important parts of the path planning process. In this paper, we propose a collision checking method that considers dwarf or negative obstacles, which can improve the traversability and stability under the promise of ensuring collision-free, and we use a kind of motion primitives which considering non-holonomic constraints for path planning to generate a kinematic-feasible path. Specifically, some existing approaches of collision checking deal with lofty and dwarf obstacles, or wide and narrow, negative obstacles in the same manner that require the entire vehicle body to steer away from them. However, some dwarf obstacles are shorter than the chassis of the vehicle while some negative obstacles are narrower than the vehicle track. In those cases, overstriding maneuvers will prove much more efficient and reasonable. Moreover, dealing with these obstacles in the same way as lofty obstacles can dramatically reduce the flexibility and disturb the stability of path planning under clustered environments, especially when the vehicle moves at higher speed. This paper proposes a double layer collision checking (DLCC) method that deals with lofty and dwarf obstacles, or wide and narrow, negative obstacles separately, effectively increasing the flexibility under the complex scenarios where dwarf and narrow negative obstacles exist."

To solve this problem, underwater light vision and underwater image enhancement technology are proposed to realize the rapid detection and recognition of underwater vehicles, so as to realize the recognition of cooperative objects. In this paper, YOLO algorithm which has a good effect on target detection precision and the recognition speed is used to recognize the underwater vehicle on the Yolo network.

Based on i-VICS, the most of data to support the autonomous driving is then provided from road-side units (RSUs) based on V2I communication. It is a highly reliable and real-time solution at low cost compared with the traditional approaches of autonomous driving. This paper discusses the control of path tracking as the basic testament induced from the newly developed technical route. The design of a path tracking algorithm based on an improved model to derive the lateral deviation via multiple assigned preview points on reference path is explored to reduce the impact of noises from reference path data. The strategy to select the optimal look-ahead distance used for deviation calculation is also analyzed. A fuzzy PD controller is then introduced to support the control of steering and the speed control based on path geometry is designed for the longitudinal control. The simulation and field tests results demonstrate a satisfactory performance finally."
9219027,Development of a Fault-Tolerant Control System for a Swarm of Drones,"One of the important challenges in an autonomous swarm of drones is the dependability of the swarm to continue its mission. Engine failure or propeller disintegration poses a significant risk to the operation of each node of the swarm and if it happens the system should be able to tolerate such malfunction by reconfiguring the swarm and reforming if it is necessary. In this paper, a fault-tolerant control system for an autonomous leader–follower based swarm of drones is presented. For defining the fault model, the full failure of an engine is considered as an emergency situation, and the controller of each node is facilitated to reconfigure the swarm from imposing a bottom-up reformation to bypass the faulty node, which keeps the formation intact as much as possible. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique with respect to reliability and robust stability."

This technology raises relevant controversies, especially with recent deadly accidents. Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are still popular and attractive thanks to the improvement they represent to people's way of life (safer and quicker transit, more accessible, comfortable, convenient, efficient, and environment-friendly). This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques over the last decade with a focus on highway planning. In the context of this article, motion planning denotes path generation and decision making. Highway situations limit the problem to high speed and small curvature roads, with specific driver rules, under a constrained environment framework. Lane change, obstacle avoidance, car following, and merging are the situations addressed in this paper. After a brief introduction to the context of autonomous ground vehicles, the detailed conditions for motion planning are described. The main algorithms in motion planning, their features, and their applications to highway driving are reviewed, along with current and future challenges and open issues."
9267910,Network Localization Based Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with Inter-Vehicle Ranging,"Localization between a swarm of AUVs can be entirely estimated through the use of range measurements between neighboring AUVs via a class of techniques commonly referred to as sensor network localization. However, the localization quality depends on network topology, with degenerate topologies, referred to as low-rigidity configurations, leading to ambiguous or highly uncertain localization results. This paper presents tools for rigidity-based analysis, planning, and control of a multi-AUV network which account for sensor noise and limited sensing range. We evaluate our long-term planning framework in several two-dimensional simulated environments and show we are able to generate paths in feasible time and guarantee a minimum network rigidity over the full course of the paths."
9639065,Diagnostic System and System Failure Protection for Autonomous Vehicle based on Driving Path and Visual Information,"Safety for autonomous vehicle is always an important issue in the development of self-driving technology. For avoiding the system failure during the self-driving process and providing an effective method about this topic, in this paper we proposed a proactive safe-diagnostic mechanism, which has a paralleled structure to the decision-making subsystem. By image-detection environment data in sensing and system response in vehicle dynamics, this method can be implemented rapidly into autonomous driving system to find the lost-control status of host vehicle. With the benefits of parallel-process structure, it will not directly affect the efficiency of decision subsystem and can reduce indeed the possibility of accident events. The vehicle experimental results showed that once the executing actions of host vehicle violate the pre-set constraints due to some unexpected factors, this diagnostic system will enable the emergency braking function immediately to confirm self-driving safety."

8654619,A 3D LiDAR Data-Based Dedicated Road Boundary Detection Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicles,"Effectively detecting road boundaries in real time is critical to the applications of autonomous vehicles, such as vehicle localization, path planning, and environmental understanding. To precisely extract the irregular road boundaries or those blocked by obstructions on the road from the 3D LiDAR data, a dedicated algorithm consisting of four steps is proposed in this paper. The steps are as follows. First, the 3D LiDAR data is pre-processed, employing the vehicle position and attitude information, and many noise points are deleted. Second, the ground points are quickly separated from the pre-processed point cloud data to reduce the disturbance from the obstacles on the road; this greatly decreases the size of the points cloud to be processed. Third, the candidate points of the road boundaries are searched along the predicted trajectory of the autonomous vehicle and filtered using the unique features of the boundary points. Last, a spline fit model is applied to smoothen the road boundaries. An experiment to test the performance of the proposed algorithm was conducted on the “Xinda” autonomous vehicle under various road scenarios. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed algorithm exceeds 93%, and its average processing time is approximately 36.5 ms/frame, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods. This indicates that the proposed algorithm can robustly extract the road boundary in real time even if there are many obstacles on the road. This algorithm has been tested on “Xinda” autonomous vehicle for over 1000 kilometers, and its performance was always stable."

It ends with a discussion and comparison of the different methods introduced, followed by conclusions."
9373943,Covert Attacks Through Adversarial Learning: Study of Lane Keeping Attacks on the Safety of Autonomous Vehicles,"Road management systems are to improve in terms of integrity, mobility, sustainability, and safety by the adoption of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things services. This article introduces the concept of covert attacks on autonomous vehicles which can jeopardize the safety of passengers. Covert attacks are designed to manipulate outputs of cyber physical systems through network channels in a way that while the changes are not easily perceptible by human beings, systems are negatively affected in the long run. We argue that future smart vehicles are vulnerable to viruses which can use adversarial learning methods to adapt themselves to hosts and remain stealth for a long period. As a case study, we design a covert attack on the lane keeping system of autonomous vehicles. In the scenario, an intelligent adversary manipulates sensor readings (lane position, curvature, etc.) in order to deceive the controller to drive the vehicle closer to the boundaries. The virus/attacker interactively learns the host vehicle behaviors in terms of lateral deviation and maneuverability and tries to increase the errors to the extent that remains unnoticeable to the driver. This process is carried out through actor-critic learning based on the Newton--Raphson method. We additionally design an intrusion detection system for such covert attacks. We use the GPS data and offline maps to reconstruct road curves and match them against readings. A simulation testbed is developed based on the map of Nurburgring-Grand Prix track to evaluate our models. Results confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed models."

This integrated scheme is achieved by unifying model predictive control (MPC) with a potential field for assigning collision risk. The target vehicle is an electrified autonomous vehicle that is capable of directly controlling traction and braking torques of vehicle. Wheel torque and steering input of vehicle are optimized by receding horizon optimization (RHO) and give us stable and comfort reference trajectories. In the optimization process, control inputs, tracking errors, and collision risk are to be minimized in a single objective function. Collision risk is taken into account by modeling proper potential fields that allow the controller to re-plan the given desired path for avoiding a collision. Simulation is conducted using a high-fidelity vehicle plant model and the control scheme demonstrates promising results by verifying optimal and stable path guaranteeing collision-free."
9652467,A Trajectory Optimization-Based Intersection Coordination Framework for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles,"Since vehicles from multiple roads frequently merge at intersections, it formulates a typical traffic bottleneck of modern transportation systems. Proper vehicle coordination and motion plan at road intersections are of importance to guarantee safety as well as improving the traffic throughput, fuel efficiency and so on. In this paper, we try to present a general dedicated intersection coordination framework for autonomous vehicles, where both high- and low-level planners are appropriately designed and integrated. In the high-level planner, two different strategies are formulated to coordinate the autonomous vehicles to generate reference trajectories and feasible ``tunnels'', respectively. Especially, a novel space-time-block based resource allocation scheme is presented to describe the feasible tunnels. Furthermore, to avoid collisions with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians, bicycles or other vehicles with human drivers, a low-level planner is designed to generate practical trajectories based on the solutions from the high-level planner, according to their local on-board observations. Simulations and practical experiments are carried out, to show that our proposed coordination framework can achieve obvious performance advantages in various traffic metrics, including the throughput, fairness in driving maneuvers and driving comfort, etc. We also find that the high-level planner is effective in eliminating possible deadlocks among autonomous vehicles, which is rarely discussed in existing investigations."
9714880,UAV Vision Aided INS/Odometer Integration for Land Vehicle Autonomous Navigation,"Autonomous navigation without external GNSS aiding is crucial for some kinds of land vehicle applications, such as military vehicles and unmanned vehicles navigation under GNSS denied environments. A typical solution for autonomous navigation can be achieved by integrating Inertial Navigation System (INS) and odometer, where the odometer can provide velocity aiding for INS. The INS/odometer integration approach can dramatically improve the navigation performances compared with the standalone INS approach, however its positioning error is still gradually accumulating with time because of lacking external position correction. This paper proposes an approach to aid the INS/odometer integration by using vision positioning, where a UAV is used to carry the vision camera and helps to realize the positioning of the vehicle by image matching. The UAV vision positioning acts a role like GNSS and provides constant position correction for INS/odometer integration. A dual-rate Kalman filter is proposed and utilized to realize the data fusing of vision, INS and odometer. Simulation and filed tests show that the proposed approach can dramatically improve the autonomous navigation performances for land vehicles."

Numerous automatic LC algorithms have been proposed. This topic, however, has not been sufficiently addressed in existing on-road manoeuvre decision methods. Therefore, this paper presents a novel LC decision (LCD) model that gives autonomous vehicles the ability to make human-like decisions. This method combines a deep autoencoder (DAE) network with the XGBoost algorithm. First, a DAE is utilized to build a robust multivariate reconstruction model using time series data from multiple sensors; then, the reconstruction error of the DAE trained with normal data is analysed for LC identification (LCI) and training data extraction. Then, to address the multi-parametric and nonlinear problem of the autonomous LC decision-making process, an XGBoost algorithm with Bayesian parameter optimization is adopted. Meanwhile, to fully train our learning model with large-scale datasets, we proposed an online training strategy that updates the model parameters with data batches. The experimental results illustrate that the DAE-based LCI model is able to accurately identify the LC behaviour of vehicles. Furthermore, with the same input features, the proposed XGBoost-based LCD model achieves better performance than other popular approaches.

It is mainly focusing on the implementation and evaluation of the tuning methods by using Ziegler-Nichols and Amigo in providing the important parameters to the PID controller namely, Kp, Ki, and Kd. The objectives of this project are to compare the performance of the Ziegler-Nichols and Amigo tuning method for the PID controller parameters to control the steering angle of the autonomous vehicle in real-time and to improve the vehicle steering dynamics performance.

9016517,Autonomous Vehicles Diagnosis Platform(AVDP) based on deep learning and loopback,"This paper proposes `Autonomous Vehicles Diagnosis Platform(AVDP) based on deep learning and loopback' to improve the safety of Autonomous driving vehicles. DLPP consists of an On-board Gateway Module (OGM) and a Self-diagnosis Module of Part (SMP). While traditional vehicle gateways were used to convert messages from the vehicle, OGM not only has the translation capabilities of existing gateways, but also uses loopback to determine whether a fault has occurred in the sensor or part. The payload, which is used by OGM to judge the sensor normally, is sent to SMP for self-diagnosis. The Self-diagnosis Module of Part (SMP) diagnoses parts itself by using the payloads transferred from the OGM. Because the SMP is designed based on an LSTM algorithm, it diagnoses a vehicle's fault by considering the correlation between previous diagnosis result and current measured parts` data. In the experiment, in the result of experiment, As the set of test data increases, the SMP increases accuracy and there is little difference in uptime, so the high accuracy SMP is more suitable for vehicle diagnostics than these two neural network models."
9029446,Safety-Critical Control for Non-affine Nonlinear Systems with Application on Autonomous Vehicle,"This paper presents a novel control framework to handle safety-critical control for non-affine nonlinear systems. The proposed control development is considered to deal with safety-critical aspects in autonomous vehicle driving. The safety constraints are guaranteed using control barrier function (CBF), which implies forward-invariance of a safe set. In particular, we focus on CBF that enforces strict state-dependent high relative degree constraints for general nonlinear vehicle models. Moreover, the CBF safety constraints are incorporated into a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework. The advantage is twofold. First, both vehicle driving safety and comfort performance can be improved. Second, it helps to reduce computational burden in real time NMPC implementation. The proposed algorithm is validated and compared with conventional NMPC in several safety-critical scenarios including sudden objects and road boundaries avoidance, showing improvements in both safety and smooth driving. The validation is conducted on high fidelity vehicle dynamics and traffic environment simulation models."
9171148,Payload Manipulation for Seed Sowing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle through interface with Pixhawk Flight Controller,"In recent years, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is growing rapidly in the agriculture sector and forest management. UAVs play a vital role in the conservation and protection of forests in forestry applications. Especially, in precision agriculture, UAVs are used to automate farming activities and increase productivity of the yield.

As a result, the seed sowing quadcopter is implemented and tested in a semi-automated mode which significantly reduces the manual operation."
9037188,Fuzzy Observer-Based Transitional Path-Tracking Control for Autonomous Vehicles,"This study addresses the path-tracking control issue of autonomous vehicles (AVs) when the GPS measurement is temporarily unavailable. In such a case, the vehicle states, location or the curvature of the reference path might be unobtainable, while the camera can be potentially used to detect the path-tracking states. To this end, this paper proposes a fuzzy-observer-based composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) controller with a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) vehicle lateral dynamic model to guarantee the normal path-tracking maneuver and improve the transient performance. A parallel distributed compensation (PDC)-based CNF control method is developed to realize the control objective with the T-S vehicle model considering the transient performance and actuator saturation. The closed-loop stability and H ∞ index performance integrating the tracking and estimation errors have been proved with a Lyapunov approach. The observer-based controller design has been implemented based on the formulation of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

8972368,Coordinated Intersection Signal Design for Mixed Traffic Flow of Human-Driven and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"This manuscript investigated coordinated intersection signal design problem for mixed traffic flow of Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Two main macroscopic impact of the mixed flow on signal setting are considered: saturation flow rate and the platoon dispersion. In order to capture the traffic flow operational characteristics on coordinated intersections, three locations, namely entrance location where the loop detector was located at, and upstream intersection and downstream intersection were defined. Two types of vehicle cumulative curves, namely cumulative arrival profile and cumulative departure profile were constructed. The mixed-flow traffic dynamics were analyzed, and the arrival-departure curves relationship was derived using a combination of Newell car-following and Akçelik acceleration model. A mixed-flow platoon dispersion model was proposed to describe the vehicle's progression between two locations. Due to the nonlinear nature of the problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method was employed to obtain the optimal signal parameters, including the cycle length, green duration, and optimal offset. The algorithm was implemented and validated in a case study involving two intersections, with the demand formulated and simulated by the Markov chain. The results showed that the proposed model could effectively decrease delays when compared with current signal control methods."
9094331,An Efficient and Scalable Simulation Model for Autonomous Vehicles With Economical Hardware,"Autonomous vehicles rely on sophisticated hardware and software technologies for acquiring holistic awareness of their immediate surroundings. Deep learning methods have effectively equipped modern self-driving cars with high levels of such awareness. However, their application requires high-end computational hardware, which makes utilization infeasible for the legacy vehicles that constitute most of today’s automotive industry. Hence, it becomes inherently challenging to achieve high performance while at the same time maintaining adequate computational complexity. In this paper, a monocular vision and scalar sensor-based model car is designed and implemented to accomplish autonomous driving on a specified track by employing a lightweight deep learning model. It can identify various traffic signs based on a vision sensor as well as avoid obstacles by using an ultrasonic sensor. The developed car utilizes a single Raspberry Pi as its computational unit. In addition, our work investigates the behavior of economical hardware used to deploy deep learning models. In particular, we herein propose a novel, computationally efficient, and cost-effective approach. The designed system can serve as a platform to facilitate the development of economical technologies for autonomous vehicles that can be used as part of intelligent transportation or advanced driver assistance systems. The experimental results indicate that this model can achieve real-time response on a resource-constrained device without significant overheads, thus making it a suitable candidate for autonomous driving in current intelligent transportation systems."

9161258,Adaptivity-Enhanced Path Tracking System for Autonomous Vehicles at High Speeds,"The path tracking is a basic function of the autonomous vehicle. Generally, it is difficult to realize the path tracking with high accuracy at high speeds. To solve this problem, an adaptivity-enhanced path tracking system (AEPTS) is investigated in this paper. The adaptive performance of this AEPTS is realized via three aspects. The first is to achieve preview distance adaptivity by a dynamic multi-point preview model (DMPPM), which provides the desired course deviation according to the vehicle speed and the reference path. The second is to improve the adaptivity of an adaptive fuzzy steering controller (AFSC) with an adaptive steering gain model which is built via the path curvature and vehicle speed. The third is that an optimal parameter surface is devised to enhance the adaptivity of the AEPTS at high speeds. Such a surface can provide the optimal coefficients for the AEPTS, and it is implemented using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a curve fitting method. At last, simulation experiments are given to verify the adaptivity of the proposed method."

Numerous approaches have been adopted to solve this problem which can have a long-lasting impact on mankind. In this paper, we have used Deep Learning techniques and TensorFlow framework with the goal of building a neural network model to predict (speed, acceleration, steering angle and brake) features needed for navigation of autonomous vehicles. The Deep Neural Network has been trained on images and sensor data obtained from comma.ai dataset. A heatmap was used to check for correlation among the features and finally four important features were selected. This was a multivariate regression problem. The final model had five convolutional layers followed by five dense layers. Finally, the calculated values were tested against the labelled data where mean squared error was used as a performance metric."
9204806,Autonomous Vehicle Source Enumeration Exploiting Non-Cooperative UAV in Software Defined Internet of Vehicles,"The traffic congestion and accidents can be relieved by deploying the software defined internet of vehicles (SDN-IoV). However, the traffic of pedestrians and vehicles is particularly heavy near commercial streets and campuses. In particular scenarios, the SDN-IoV may not ensure the quality of service (QoS) for pedestrians and vehicles. In this paper, we construct a novel system architecture consisting of multiple non-cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a SDN-IoV. The non-cooperative UAV is equipped with an antenna array to receive the signals from the vehicles and pedestrians of SDN-IoV. In order to locate the positions of vehicles and pedestrians, two source enumeration methods are proposed in a complex SDN-IoV environment with color noise. The projection matrix of the low dimensional signal subspace is constructed by the proposed criterion based on signal subspace projection (SSP). The sequence of the projected difference values of the local covariance matrix is applied to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. The eigenvalues can be grouped to construct different subspaces by the proposed eigen-subspace projection (ESP). By projecting a new covariance matrix into the eigen-subspaces, the variance of values represents the projection difference can be exploited to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results and real system test verify the validity of the two proposed methods by comparing them with the state-of-the-art methods. Both of the methods have excellent estimation performance especially in color noise."
8917309,A Simulation Modeling Framework with Autonomous Vehicle Region-based Routing and Public Transit Diversion Integration,"In this paper, we present a simulation modeling framework that can accommodate multiple classes of travelers and integrates several distinct features, which in turn can be associated with each of the traveler classes, thus providing flexibility and a so-called bird's-eye view to any potential user. Concretely, we integrate into the multi-class region-based dynamic traffic model, called multi-class Network Transmission Model (McNTM), several features, including a public transit diversion component, as well as routing methods associated with different traveler classes. Three distinct traveler classes are defined, the 1 st class of travelers equipped with autonomous vehicles, the 2 nd traveler class comprising of RGIS-equipped, conventional vehicles and the 3 rd traveler class comprising of unequipped, conventional vehicles. Certain assumptions are made for each traveler class. The gain in overall performance for the case where 1 st and 2 nd class travelers are present in the system, ranges from 0.78% - 23.43%. Region-based routing methods employed by the 1 st and 2 nd class respectively, not only benefit overall network performance, but with their respective market penetration rates exceeding certain thresholds, can prove beneficial to the individual performance of other traveler classes."
9062585,Integrated Steering and Differential Braking for Emergency Collision Avoidance in Autonomous Vehicles,"Controlling the lateral dynamics of an autonomous vehicle confronting a sudden obstacle requires optimal use of tires' force capacities. In these situations, autonomous steering may not be able to respond fast enough to prevent collision or instability. This paper presents an integrated controller for autonomous vehicles, capable of suitably reacting to emergency situations when a sudden obstacle appears on the road. The proposed controller employs differential braking conservatively when needed, to produce an additional yaw moment, thereby improving a vehicle's lateral agility and responsiveness without endangering vehicle stability. A longitudinal controller is also designed to track a desired longitudinal velocity. Model predictive control (MPC) method is used for developing a combined path planning and tracking controller with a hierarchical structure that prioritizes (1) collision avoidance, (2) vehicle stability, and (3) path tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated MPC controller is evaluated by simulating an experimentally validated CarSim model to demonstrate the controller's capability in preventing instability and collisions."
9661191,Force-Driven Path Tracking Control Strategy Based on Vehicle Side-Slip Angle Observation,"In order to improve the path tracking control accuracy of autonomous vehicles and ensure vehicle stability, the force-driven MPC path tracking control strategy based on vehicle side-slip angle observation is proposed. Firstly, the vehicle dynamics model and tire dynamics model are modeled, the path tracking control system space state model is constructed to predict vehicle states information. Then, the vehicle side-slip angle observer is designed based on steady state model, which directly obtains observation result using vehicle lateral acceleration and yaw acceleration. The tires lateral force is used for the MPC path tracking controller, which can make full use of the nonlinear dynamics characteristic of tires. Finally, the simulation experiment show that the proposed controller has a good control performance through the CarSim and Matlab/Simulink joint platform."

Our experimental evaluation reveals a clear superiority of sliding mode control when compared with Fuzzy logic control and PID controllers.
8911780,High Precision Indoor Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous driving is an important trend of the automotive industry. The continuous research towards this goal requires a precise reference vehicle state estimation under all circumstances in order to develop and test autonomous vehicle functions. However, even when lane-accurate positioning is expected from oncoming technologies, like the L5 GPS band, the question of accurate positioning in roofed areas, e.g., tunnels or park houses, still has to be addressed. In this paper, a novel procedure for a reference vehicle state estimation is presented. The procedure includes three main components. First, a robust standstill detection based purely on signals from an Inertial Measurement Unit. Second, a vehicle state estimation by means of statistical filtering. Third, a high accuracy LiDAR-based positioning method that delivers velocity, position and orientation correction data with a mean error of 0.1 m/s, 4.7 cm and 1° respectively. Runtime tests on a CPU indicates the possibility of real-time implementation."
8939966,An Evaluation of a State-Predictive Controller and a Jitter Buffer for Remote Controlled Autonomous Vehicles via the Internet,"In the age of Internet of Things, when various devices connect to communication networks, Unmanned Vehicle'.;;s (UV's) remote autonomous driving applications are attracting attention. Autonomous driving technology is expected to enable not only automobiles but also various interesting applications. Examples include patrol monitoring inside and outside a building by a small traveling vehicle loaded with surveillance cameras, delivery of goods on office floor, and traveling of wheelchairs. In the case of a traveling vehicle controlled remotely via the Internet, there is a problem that control stability is degraded due to packet transmission delay and its jitter. This belongs to the more general problem of stabilizing feedback control with “dead time” in the control theory. Many studies have shown that state-predictive controllers are effective against delay. Also, it has been shown that a jitter buffer is effective for delay jitter. Our research goal is to realize a system that controls multiple small vehicles via the Internet and a Wi-Fi. In the system, remote control can be disturbed by transmission delay and its jitter. And the faster the driving speed, the lower the stability of the traveling route. In this study, we carried out experiments with a UV simulator. We show experimental evaluation results of a state-predictive controller and a jitter buffer for improving the stability of the traveling route. We also clarified the maximum traveling speed of a UV, that can be achieved under conditions of transmission delay and its jitter."
9551112,"First Steps Toward The Development Of Virtual Platform For Validation Of Autonomous Wheel Loader At Pulp-And-Paper Mill: Modelling, Control And Real-Time Simulation","The forestry industry all over the world is seeing the need for modernization of its machines toward autonomy. In this paper, we focus on a wheel loader that should operate autonomously in the yard of a pulp-and-paper mill, scooping wood chips from a pile of wood and dropping them into a hopper, which is linked to a conveyor that carries them inside the mill. The modelling of the wheel loader is elaborated first, while taking into account that it is composed of two systems: (i) the vehicle and (ii) the arm carrying the bucket. Notice that the former pertains to the category of articulated vehicles that steer using a different mechanism than the conventional Ackermann steering used in car-like vehicles. As for the latter, it is a 2DOF serial manipulator. The navigation is considered then. Finally, simulation results of the kinematics model are shown in Matlab/Simulink first, then dynamics and 3D animation are added using ROS2/Gazebo. Notice that this work is a first step toward the development of the digital twin of the wheel loader. Later, it will be used as the virtual platform for the validation of the autonomous wheel loader."

9737055,Secure Data Sharing With Flexible Cross-Domain Authorization in Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"As an increasingly prevalent technology in intelligent autonomous transportation systems, autonomous vehicle platoon has been indicated the ability to significantly reduce fuel consumption as well as heighten highway safety and throughput. However, existing efforts rarely focus on protecting data confidentiality and authenticity in autonomous vehicle platoons. How to ensure secure and high-fidelity platoon-level communication is still in its infancy. This paper makes the first attempt for efficient and secure communication across autonomous vehicle platoons. Specifically, we present PDSM-FC, the first privacy-preserving data share mechanism with flexible cross-domain authorization over distinctive platoons. The key insight of PDSM-FC is the design of a new ciphertext conversion technique, which allows a ciphertext to be easily converted into another type of ciphertext, facilitating efficient access by all entities holding the legitimate authorization. As a result, PDSM-FC can achieve high-fidelity data communication between two unique platoons in ciphertext, so as to complete specific tasks including platoon integration. Rigorous security analysis shows that PDSM-FC is secure against various attacks such as collusion, forgery and chosen-plaintext attacks. Moreover, theoretical evaluation and extensive experiments demonstrate the practicability of PDSM-FC in terms of functionality, storage and computation overheads."
9335478,Comparing State-of-the-Art and Emerging Augmented Reality Interfaces for Autonomous Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Communication,"Providing pedestrians and other vulnerable road users with a clear indication about a fully autonomous vehicle status and intentions is crucial to make them coexist. In the last few years, a variety of external interfaces have been proposed, leveraging different paradigms and technologies including vehicle-mounted devices (like LED panels), short-range on-road projections, and road infrastructure interfaces (e.g., special asphalts with embedded displays). These designs were experimented in different settings, using mockups, specially prepared vehicles, or virtual environments, with heterogeneous evaluation metrics. Promising interfaces based on Augmented Reality (AR) have been proposed too, but their usability and effectiveness have not been tested yet. This paper aims to complement such body of literature by presenting a comparison of state-of-the-art interfaces and new designs under common conditions. To this aim, an immersive Virtual Reality-based simulation was developed, recreating a well-known scenario represented by pedestrians crossing in urban environments under non-regulated conditions. A user study was then performed to investigate the various dimensions of vehicle-to-pedestrian interaction leveraging objective and subjective metrics. Even though no interface clearly stood out over all the considered dimensions, one of the AR designs achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of safety and trust, at the cost of higher cognitive effort and lower intuitiveness compared to LED panels showing anthropomorphic features. Together with rankings on the various dimensions, indications about advantages and drawbacks of the various alternatives that emerged from this study could provide important information for next developments in the field."

It is a common method to generate a feasible path to the target state and append an optimization-based method for path postprocessing. In this paper a Hybrid A* based motion planning algorithm is presented for autonomous vehicles under unstructured circumstances. Firstly, the Hybrid A* algorithm is improved with a better heuristic function and a better search policy to realize a less-time consuming graph search in consideration of vehicle's motion model. Then, nonlinear optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the generated path further and realizes high quality of security and smoothness of the discrete trajectory. Finally, Catmull-Rom interpolation is combined to make waypoints continuous and easy-to-control. Simulation results concerning different tasks are described to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm."

Due to the uncertainty of the environment, and the nonlinear dynamics of the vehicles, controlling them is typically an involved task. Albeit a number of controller designs are possible, and several are available in the literature, it is unclear which designs are better suited for specific vehicles. In this paper, we design classical controllers, linear quadratic regulators and sliding mode controllers for the depth and steering subsystems of the Oceanographic Systems Laboratory's REMUS 100. Based on the performances of these designs, we suggest appropriate controllers for the two subsystems."

In particular, sensor data sharing, known as cooperative perception, is a crucial technique to accommodate vulnerable road users in a cooperative intelligent transport system (ITS). In this regard, open-source software plays a significant role in prototyping, validation, and deployment. Specifically, in the developer community, Autoware is a popular open-source software for self-driving vehicles, and OpenC2X is an open-source experimental and prototyping platform for cooperative ITS. This paper reports on a system named AutoC2X to enable cooperative perception by using OpenC2X for Autoware-based autonomous vehicles. The developed system is evaluated by conducting field experiments involving real hardware. The results demonstrate that AutoC2X can deliver the cooperative perception message within 100 ms in the worst case."
9304778,"Autonomous Driving Vehicle Control Auto-Calibration System: An Industry-Level, Data-Driven and Learning-based Vehicle Longitudinal Dynamic Calibrating Algorithm","The control module is a crucial part for autonomous driving systems, a typical control algorithm often requires vehicle dynamics (such as longitudinal dynamics) as inputs, which, unfortunately are difficult to calibrate in real time. Further, it is also a challenge to reflect instantaneous changes in longitudinal dynamics (e.g. load changes) using a calibration table. As a result, control performance may deteriorate when load changes considerably (especially for small cargoes). In this paper, we will show how we build a data-driven longitudinal calibration procedure using machine learning techniques to adapt load changes in real time. We first generated offline calibration tables from human driving data. The offline table serves as an initial guess for later uses, and it only requires twenty minutes of data collection and processing. We then used an online learning algorithm to appropriately update the initial table (the offline table) based on real-time performance analysis. Experiments indicated (a) offline auto-calibration leads to a better control accuracy, compared with manual calibration; (b) online auto-calibration is capable to handle load changes and significantly reduce real time control error. This system has been deployed to more than one hundred Baidu self-driving vehicles (both hybrid and electronic vehicles) since April 2018. By January 2019, the system had been tested for more than 2,000 hours and over 10,000 kilometers (6,213 miles) and was still proven to be effective."

Concentration of energy in energy storage makes it possible to build off-grid installations, home autonomous systems, common conventional gas stations that can be used as charging stations for electric vehicles, incl. and electric trucks and is a great example of considering “green power” in freight, civil and domestic transport (warehouses, logistics bases, manufacturing). A completely new aspect of energy storage, which has been discussed recently, but may play an important role in the near future, is the storage of electricity in batteries, incl. and electric cars. The idea is that car batteries will generally be charged at night, and if an intelligent distribution network is implemented, the charging cycle itself can be controlled centrally or by neural networks."
8826251,Multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Cooperative Localization in Anchor-Free Environments,"The localization of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in anchor-free environments has always been a difficult problem due to the lack of global positioning systems and absolute references. In general, AUVs localize themselves by dead reckoning (DR), whereas the localization error grows without bound. To alleviate the growth of the localization errors, we propose intermittent belief propagation based dead reckoning (IBPDR) as a cooperative localization (CL) framework. In IBPDR, AUVs use DR to localize themselves and periodically correct DR's deviation with CL methods. The intermittent feature of IBPDR reduces communication costs among AUVs by decreasing the frequency of CL. In the IBPDR framework, we design a particle-based underwater-adaptive belief propagation (UABP) algorithm for CL. The UABP algorithm is naturally distributed and viable in nonlinear and non-Gaussian situations. Thus, it is suitable for CL issues. Furthermore, the UABP algorithm is robust to the accumulated inertial measurement errors and reduces communication costs among AUVs. Moreover, we propose a particle-based current-aided filter to further improve the localization accuracy by comparing AUVs' ambient current observations with the available current maps. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithms by comparisons with alternative approaches in localization accuracy, communication costs, and robustness to abnormal cases, such as packet loss, ranging bias, and outliers."
9575425,A Hazard Analysis Approach based on STPA and Finite State Machine for Autonomous Vehicles,"Hazard analysis is a quite significant step to ensure vehicle safety in the early stage of vehicle development according to current standards. However, the complexity of the Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS), which consist of various software and hardware components, makes it difficult to identify system hazards. Nowadays, System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), a hazard analysis method for complex systems, is applied to ADAS, and simple ADS gradually and proved applicable. This paper introduced Finite State Machine (FSM) to complement the STPA for its weakness in analyzing high-level autonomous vehicles with multiple automated modes and functions. Firstly, previous applications of STPA to ADAS and ADS and their limitations are analyzed. Secondly, the hazardous event is defined. An extended method combining STPA and FSM is proposed to model the vehicle states and environmental conditions and analyze unexpected behaviors. Finally, a case study on an autonomous vehicle is given to compare the traditional STPA and the extended method. Comparing with the traditional STPA, the proposed method can identify more hazardous events and give more detailed information about hazardous events to generate testing scenarios."

Firstly, according to the tracking error of the system, the backstepping controller is designed based on the Lyapunov stability principle. Then inspired by biological characteristics, a neural dynamic model is introduced into the controller design process and its output virtual signal is used as a component of the controller, using the smooth response signal of the above model to realize the continuity and smoothness of the differential signal. Finally, the designed controller is simulated based on the affine nonlinear mathematical model of the reentry vehicle, by which verified that the algorithm has good closed-loop control stability and rapidity, and the control command output is continuous."
8911483,Requirements-Driven Test Generation for Autonomous Vehicles With Machine Learning Components,"Autonomous vehicles are complex systems that are challenging to test and debug. A requirements-driven approach to the development process can decrease the resources required to design and test these systems, while simultaneously increasing the reliability. We present a testing framework that uses signal temporal logic (STL), which is a precise and unambiguous requirements language. Our framework evaluates test cases against the STL formulae and additionally uses the requirements to automatically identify test cases that fail to satisfy the requirements. One of the key features of our tool is the support for machine learning (ML) components in the system design, such as deep neural networks. The framework allows evaluation of the control algorithms, including the ML components, and it also includes models of CCD camera, lidar, and radar sensors, as well as the vehicle environment. We use multiple methods to generate test cases, including covering arrays, which is an efficient method to search discrete variable spaces. The resulting test cases can be used to debug the controller design by identifying controller behaviors that do not satisfy requirements. The test cases can also enhance the testing phase of development by identifying critical corner cases that correspond to the limits of the system's allowed behaviors. We present STL requirements for an autonomous vehicle system, which capture both component-level and system-level behaviors. Additionally, we present three driving scenarios and demonstrate how our requirements-driven testing framework can be used to identify critical system behaviors, which can be used to support the development process."
9564576,Belief state separated reinforcement learning for autonomous vehicle decision making under uncertainty,"In autonomous driving, the ego vehicle and its surrounding traffic environments always have uncertainties like parameter and structural errors, behavior randomness of road users, etc. Furthermore, environmental sensors are noisy or even biased. This problem can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process. Existing methods lack a good representation of historical information, making it very challenging to find an optimal policy. This paper proposes a belief state separated reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for decision-making of autonomous driving in uncertain environments. We extend the separation principle from linear Gaussian systems to general nonlinear stochastic environments, where the belief state, defined as the posterior distribution of the true state, is found to be a sufficient statistic of historical information. This belief state is estimated by action-enhanced variational inference from historical information and is proved to satisfy the Markovian property, thus allowing us to obtain the optimal policy using traditional RL algorithms for Markov decision processes. The policy gradient of a task-specific prior model is mixed with that of the interaction data to improve learning performance. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a multi-lane autonomous driving task, where the surrounding vehicles are subject to behavior uncertainty and observation noise. The simulation results show that compared with existing RL algorithms, the proposed method can achieve a higher average return with better driving performance."
9021725,Online Recommendation System for Autonomous and Human-driven Ride-hailing Taxi Services,"With the rapid development of autonomous vehicle technology, modern taxi services will potentially witness an important revolution, where some regular cabs will be substituted by self-driving taxis. In this study, we propose a hybrid taxi recommendation system where both autonomous and human-driven ride-hailing vehicles are guided in order to meet the needs of taxi customers as well as the expectation of human drivers. Customers desire to wait the minimum time before finding a taxi, while drivers aim to maximize their profits by speeding up their customer hunting. Autonomous taxis are used to back-up human-driven taxis in areas where customers' demand levels are low. Three major components compose our system: a taxi demand predictor, taxi-to-region assigner, and taxi routing optimizer. Our simulation model is applied on the borough of Manhattan, New York City (NYC), and is validated with realistic data. The selected results show that significant performance gains in terms of number of pickups, customer waiting time, and vacant traveled distance of human-drivers can be achieved compared to those of the traditional human-based taxi system."
9628587,System configuration of Human-in-the-loop Simulation for Level 3 Autonomous Vehicle using IPG CarMaker,"The increasingly automated vehicles (AV) have increased the complexity of the testing methods and number of driven miles required to demonstrate the vehicle system’s reliability. Most modern autonomous driving systems also used deep neural networks which requires a large amount of data to develop. Physical driving alone to collect driving data and test system’s safety is no longer suitable for development of AV as this is costly, time consuming and could harm the road users if the safety system failed. This paper proposed human-in-the-loop simulation testing for evaluation of an autonomous vehicle using a 3D virtual vehicle driving platform that can be used for safety assessment of autonomous vehicle. The aim of this study is to establish human-computer interaction platform that can be used as safety testing for Level 3 autonomous vehicle whereby an emergency takeover is required during critical driving conditions. The proposed platform make use of IPG CarMaker to provide 3D virtual environment with accurate vehicle dynamics model, sensor model and environment model. We are able to interface the IPG CarMaker with Simulink and successfully developed a Simulink model that can interface a steering and pedal driving hardware with the virtual vehicle in the simulation. We can also collect driving data and simulation data from the IPG CarMaker as well as accessing the variable in the IPG CarMaker in real-time using Python. The recorded data can be used to train and fine-tune autonomous system based on machine learning."

Autonomous ships will provide the possibility to eliminate the likelihood of human error, reduce unnecessary crew costs and increase the efficiency of the cargo spaces. Although a significant work is being made, and new algorithms are arising, they are still a mirage and still have some problems regarding safety, autonomy and reliability. This paper proposes an online obstacle avoidance algorithm for Autonomous Surfaces Vehicles (ASVs) introducing the reachability with the protective zone concepts. This method estimates a collision-free velocity based on inner and outer constraints such as, current velocity, direction, maximum speed and turning radius of the vehicle, position and dimensions of the surround obstacles as well as a movement prediction in a close future. A non-restrictive estimative for the speed and direction of the ASV is calculated by mapping a conflict zone, determined by the course of the vehicle and the distance to obstacles that is used to avoid imminent dangerous situations. A set of simulations demonstrates the ability of this method to safely circumvent obstacles in several scenarios with different weather conditions."
9294644,Safety-centred analysis of transition stages to traffic with fully autonomous vehicles,"The aim of this paper is to highlight and investigate the effects of increasing presence rate of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in terms of traffic safety and traffic flow characteristics. For this purpose, using existing driver models in traffic simulator SUMO we identify and analyze those parameters that characterize and distinguish AVs' driving from manual driving in a heterogeneous traffic context. While it is essential to identify the parameters for traffic flow characteristics of heterogeneous fleets compared to homogeneous ones comprising manually driven vehicles (MV) only (i.e. current status), the safety aspects must be also accounted for. In order to combine these two fundamental aspects of heterogeneous traffic, we used a complete description of a highway driving scenario. The scenario integrates the perceptions of different type of vehicles (i.e. AV and MV) involved and the reaction times of human drivers and decision-making units of autonomous vehicles, to explore the impact of both the rate of AV presence and the perturbation in perception capabilities in highway scenarios."

In order to support those requirements, additional technologies must be employed. The current paper discusses the possibility of the use of airborne platforms aiming to support the terrestrial networks for autonomous vehicles realization as a part of delay-critical applications. Airborne platforms will help in provisioning of safe road trips by delivering time-critical information to the vehicles globally, even in remote areas. In this paper, we discuss technical requirements and potential solutions for supporting the autonomous vehicle infrastructure, as a part of intelligent transportation system."
8756239,Intelligent Intersection Management Systems Considering Autonomous Vehicles: A Systematic Literature Review,"Over the past several decades, the development of technologies and the production of autonomous vehicles have enhanced the need for intelligent intersection management systems. Subsequently, growing interest in studying the traffic management of autonomous vehicles at intersections has been evident, which indicates a critical need to conduct a systematic literature review on this topic. This paper offers a systematic review of the proposed methodologies for intelligent intersection management systems and presents the remaining research gaps and possible future research approaches. We consider both pure autonomous vehicle traffic and mixed traffic at four-way signalized and unsignalized intersection(s). We searched for articles published from 2008 to 2019, and identified 105 primary studies. We applied the thematic analysis method to analyze the extracted data, which led to the identification of four main classes of methodologies, namely rule-based, optimization, hybrid, and machine learning methods. We also compared how well the methods satisfy their goals, namely efficiency, safety, ecology, and passenger comfort. This analysis allowed us to determine the primary challenges of the presented methodologies and propose new approaches in this area."
9032369,Event-Triggered Dynamic Surface Control of an Underactuated Autonomous Surface Vehicle for Target Enclosing,"This article addresses the event-triggered dynamic surface control of an underactuated autonomous surface vehicle with unknown kinetics for circumnavigating a dynamic target with unknown velocity. A modular design approach to the event-triggered dynamic surface control is proposed for target enclosing. In the estimator module, an extended state observer is employed for estimating the relative motion between the target and the surface vehicle. A fuzzy system is used for online modeling the unknown vehicle kinetics. In the controller module, an event-triggered dynamic surface control law is constructed by using the estimated relative velocities and vehicle kinetics in the estimator module. In the control law, a triggered mechanism is introduced to reduce the transmission load and the execution rate of actuators. Besides, the control inputs are bounded with the aid of a projection operator and saturated functions. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop target enclosing system is proven through Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the event-triggered dynamic surface control method for circumnavigating a maneuvering target."

9600343,Autonomous and Electrical Vehicles Development using Optimized Processes Defined by Cyber Security and Safety Management System,"The current trend in automotive is to develop electrical and autonomous vehicles (EV&AV). The paper presents an original concept which can be used to develop AV&EV, but the same concept can be used also for ""classical vehicles"". The work paper begins with a brief review on the evolution of safety and cyber security standards applicable in the automotive industry. Most of the players in the automotive market do not have dedicated processes for safety and for cybersecurity. The authors propose a list of processes developed based on ISO 26262[1] and ISO/SAE 21434[2] requirements. Beside this proposal they are coming with an innovative concept which is coming into one integrated system called CSSMS (Cybersecurity and Safety Management System). This concept has as main purpose the reduction of time and resources used for development but also the fulfillment of all the requirements of the standards. In the end the concept proposed is partially validated using a steering product and proposes some steps for validating the entire system."
9426747,Research on congestion pricing to improve connected autonomous vehicles penetration rate,"Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are an important development direction of future traffic, and they play a positive role in reducing pollution, easing congestion and improving driving safety. Therefore, it is very necessary to take measures to encourage the popularization of CAVs. This paper studies the impact of congestion pricing on users' choice of travel mode, establishes a bi-level programming model, and discusses how to induce people to choose a more environmentally friendly travel mode and a more reasonable travel path through economic means in the presence of a hybrid traffic network of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). The interaction between CAVs and HDVs is considered in the lower-level model, and the mode selection of individual traveler is described by using variational inequality (VI). The upper-level model constructs a mathematical programming model with the goal of minimizing the total travel time of the system. Diagonalization algorithm and genetic algorithm are used to solve the numerical example. The results show the influence and improvement of congestion pricing on the index."
9304698,A Unified Evaluation Framework for Autonomous Driving Vehicles,"Automated Driving System (ADS) safety assessment is a crucial step before deployment on public roads. Despite the importance of ADS safety assurance to test ADS reliability, most of the existing work is strongly attached to a single testing data source (i.e. on-road collected testing data, simulation or test track). Each source has different fidelity levels and capabilities, therefore there is a lack of a solution that allows for all data sources to complement each other to enable agnostic end to end evaluation and contributes towards different testing goals. Evaluation of ADSs is considered as a mandatory step in the autonomous vehicle development life cycle, demanding a reliable and comprehensive method is important. Here, we propose a source-agnostic framework, which can perform ADS evaluation compatible with different testing sources. Our findings show that this comprehensive solution can save time, effort and money consumed in ADS evaluation."

Aspects of elaboration and design methodology of the battery charging station are approached both from the three-phase electrical network, but also from a photovoltaic plant. A new structure of the battery charging station with power supply from a photovoltaic plant parallel to the public electricity grid was developed. The photovoltaic plant was dimensioned and the amount of electricity produced and consumed at the charging station was estimated. The excess of energy generated by the photovoltaic plant can be injected into the grid or, in offGrid mode, stored in buffer batteries."

This method improves the speed and stability of the vehicle in automatic driving mode under certain conditions. However, the model we use also has great shortcomings. In the case of complicated links and aggressive modes of other car owners, there are still challenges in vehicle safety."
9551163,"Verification, Trustworthiness and Accountability of Human-Driven Autonomous Systems","Despite the fact that autonomous systems’ science and control theory have almost 50 years of history, the community is facing major challenges to ensure the safety of fully autonomous consumer systems. It mostly concerns the verification and high fidelity operation of safety-critical systems, may that be a self-driving car, a homecare robot or a surgical manipulator. The community still struggles to establish objective criteria for trustworthiness of AI driven / machine learning based control systems. On one hand, we celebrate the rise of cognitive capabilities in robotic systems, leading independent decision making; on the other hand, decisions made in complex environments, based on multi-sensory data will surly lead to some wrong conclusions and hazardous outcome, jeopardizing the public trust in entire application domains. This ambiguity led to the currently ruling safety principle to offer the possibility for a human-driven override, translating to Level of Autonomy 3 and 4 with autonomous vehicles.The aim of the development community is to establish processes and metrics to ensure the reliability of the takeover process, when the human driver or operator takes back the partial or full control from the autonomous system. We have been building complex simulators and data collection systems to benchmark human decision making against the computer. Situation Awareness (SA) has been identified as a key, as it defines the level of cognitive understanding and capability of a human operator in a given environment. Assessing, maintaining and regaining efficiently SA are core elements of the relevant research projects, reviewed and compared in this talk. Based on the research at the Antal Bejczy Center for Intelligent Robotics at Óbuda University, we created an assessment method for critical handover performance, to quantitatively define the required level and components of SA with respect to the autonomous functionalities present.

9306103,A Reinforcement Learning based Path Guidance Scheme for Long-range Autonomous Valet Parking in Smart Cities,"Finding a parking slot in the city centre has always been a great challenge. In many cases, drivers spend a lot of time roaming around looking for an empty and suitable parking slot. The emerging machine learning technologies in intelligent transport system has made it more flexible for Electric Autonomous Vehicle (EAV) to find a parking slot and get parked. The Long-range Autonomous Valet Parking (LAVP) allows an EAV to drop user at a suitable drop-off spot and select an economical parking slot. With the evolution of battery operated vehicles, the primary concern is efficient use of battery resources. This can be done either by maximizing battery capacity or by smartly using battery with existing capacity. During the parking process, most of the energy is consumed by finding an optimal path to parking slot. The work proposed in this paper guides EAV from a random starting point to nearest drop-off spot and CP. A Reinforcement Learning based Autonomous Valet Parking technique (RL-LAVP) has been designed to guide EAV to drop-off spot, CP and minimize the total distance covered during this process. The RL-LAVP results show a significant improvement towards minimizing covered distance and consumed energy when compared with RaNdom (RN) parking and LAVP parking techniques."
9267892,A risk-averse approach to mission planning: nupiri muka at the Thwaites Glacier,"Deploying and AUV in areas such as near and beneath ice is a high-risk activity in which an AUV can be rendered unrecoverable. A risk-averse approach to mission planning and execution can increase the likelihood of vehicle return. This approach relies on a straightforward mission template that defines mission locations and task transitions that prioritizes vehicle recovery among mission objectives. In early 2020, this methodology was put to the test in the Thwaites Glacier region of Antarctica. The execution of this methodology proved highly valuable in conducting reliable AUV operations in a challenging and dynamic environment.Presented are the core ethos and guiding methodology of our risk-averse mission planning strategy."
9707738,Cyber Traffic Light: Safe Cooperation for Autonomous Vehicles at Dynamic Intersections,"Autonomous driving systems are becoming increasingly feasible and highly expected to be the heart of intelligent transportation systems. To deploy the autonomous driving vehicles on public roads, one of the practical challenges might be safe cooperation and collaboration among multiple vehicles, in particular when conflicts arise on shared road segments, such as road intersections, merge points, construction zones, single-track lanes, and center turn lane. In the current traffic systems, human drivers navigate these regions using a combination of traffic rules, social norms, courtesy, hand signals, and common sense. In this paper, we identify and classify such Dynamic Intersections that might lead to vehicle accidents and/or deadlocks and that might appear almost anytime and anywhere on public roads. In addition, we present a cooperative dynamic intersection protocol that uses on-board perception systems and vehicular communications for peer-to-peer negotiation. Under our protocol, autonomous driving vehicles can create a vehicular communication-based traffic manager named Cyber Traffic Light when congestion arises. Cyber Traffic Light works as a self-organizing, self-planning, and self-optimizing traffic manager, and it allocates the green period for vehicles coming from the multiple directions. Finally, we showed that our decentralized protocol has much higher traffic throughput, compared to two simple protocols while guaranteeing road safety."
9134692,"Computer Vision for Autonomous Vehicles: Problems, Datasets and State of the Art","act:
Recent years have witnessed enormous progress in AI-related fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles. As with any rapidly growing field, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay up-to-date or enter the field as a beginner. While several survey papers on particular sub-problems have appeared, no comprehensive survey on problems, datasets, and methods in computer vision for autonomous vehicles has been published. This monograph attempts to narrow this gap by providing a survey on the state-of-the-art datasets and techniques. Our survey includes both the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state of the art on several specific topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation, tracking, scene understanding, and end-to-end learning for autonomous driving. Towards this goal, we analyze the performance of the state of the art on several challenging benchmarking datasets, including KITTI, MOT, and Cityscapes. Besides, we discuss open problems and current research challenges. To ease accessibility and accommodate missing references, we also provide a website that allows navigating topics as well as methods and provides additional information."
9203087,GNSS Location Verification in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using in-Vehicle Multimodal Sensor Data Fusion,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), e.g., the Global Positioning System (GPS), for the provision of accurate location information for various functionalities including Vehicle-to-Vehicle/Infrastructure (V2V/V2I) communication and self-navigation. However, GNSS-based location awareness is prone to spoofing attacks, where the attacker generates counterfeit satellite signals. This in turn poses a serious threat to the CAV, e.g., car, drone, etc., as well as the surrounding entities. Thus, this threat needs to be detected reliably and mitigated timely to prevent undesired consequences (e.g., damages, casualties, etc.). To this end, this work proposes a location verification solution that leverages in-vehicle sensor readings (e.g., accelerometer, etc.) and Signals of Opportunity (SoO), as an alternative source of location information. In particular, the multimodal sensor data with SoO location measurements are fused by means of a Kalman filter and the estimated fusion-based location is used to verify the location output of the GPS receiver. In case the GPS location deviates considerably from the fusion-based location, then a location spoofing attack is ascertained. Preliminary experimental results with real GPS and sensor data collected with a drone demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
8943870,A non-potential Target Function for Controlling the UAVs Group Flight in Presence of Concave Obstacles,"A solution for the problem of controlling the unmanned quadrotor vehicles group flight in presence of obstacles of complex form is proposed. A traditional approach to construction of the target function does not solve the problem of control at presence of concave obstacles; the UAVs may get trapped in such a situation. The proposed target function contains the three terms. The first of them controls the UAVs' behavior with respect to attitude. The second is built on the base of a moving coordinate system bound to the trajectory of the group motion. The third addend is a standard sum that performs the function of repelling the UAVs one from another. Also, in the proposed approach the motion is bound to the virtual center of the group, instead of one UAV that is chosen to be a leader. This approach helps to avoid a discrepancy between desired and actual states of the group in case that the leader UAV experiences some problems with its motion."

9294509,Effects of Controller Heterogeneity on Autonomous Vehicle Traffic,"Interactions between road users are both highly non-linear and profoundly complex, and there is no reason to expect that interactions between autonomous vehicles will be any different. Given the recent rapid development of autonomous vehicle technologies, we need to understand how these interactions are likely to present themselves, and what their implications might be. This paper looks into the impact of autonomous vehicles with differing controllers, focusing specifically on the effects of changing the mean and heterogeneity of controller parameters on three key performance metrics: throughput, passenger safety and comfort. Towards this end, we develop a method for systematically sampling vehicle controllers as a function of parameter heterogeneity. In addition to evaluating the impact of heterogeneity on performance, we quantity the relative impacts of controller input parameters on the output performance metrics by means of sensitivity analyses. The MovSim traffic simulator was used to simulate a realistic traffic system, whilst recording maximum throughput, as well as lane change frequencies and mean absolute accelerations as proxies for safety and comfort. Our results reveal that traffic performance is primarily affected by the heterogeneity of vehicle target velocities, as well as by the mean values of a very small subset of the parameters, of which the target velocity is by far the most significant."
9514525,Overriding Autonomous Driving Systems Using Adaptive Adversarial Billboards,"The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to its increased deployment in various real-world applications, which provides strong incentives for motivated adversaries to manipulate the results and models generated by these algorithms. We present an automated, physically-realizable, dynamic adversarial attack to compromise an end-to-end trained DNN controlled autonomous vehicle. The attack is initiated by installing a billboard displaying videos on the roadside to incoming DNN controlled vehicles so that the vehicle tracks an adversary customized trajectory. The billboard contains an integrated camera to enable estimation of the pose of the approaching vehicle. The dynamic billboard images (i.e., a video) continuously adapt to the vehicle's relative pose with respect to the billboard while being robust to variations in lighting, view angle, and weather. The attack's effectiveness is shown on a recently developed off-the-shelf high-fidelity simulator, CARLA, for autonomous vehicles. CARLA utilizes an end-to-end learning-based autonomous navigation system. The proposed approach is applicable to other end-to-end trained autonomous cyber-physical systems."
8951560,An Optimal Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicles Based on Vehicle Dynamics Constraints,"In order to improve the safety and comfort of the unmanned vehicle, an optimal local trajectory planning algorithm based on the constraints of vehicle dynamics equation is proposed in this paper, which can also conveniently satisfy the constraints at the starting and end point of the trajectory. In order to prove the superiority of this algorithm, this paper compares it with another two commonly used trajectories described by trigonometric and polynomial function between the same starting and end point, and contrastive analysis of the tracking deviation under a same control strategy. The tracking results show that zero error tracking can be achieved for the optimal trajectory because the optimal trajectory and corresponding steering angle are obtained at the same time in our algorithm and the vehicle dynamic constraints also have been taken into consideration. The polynomial path tracking error is the largest and the trigonometric path is moderate comparatively. In the whole tracking process, the optimal path proposed in this paper can obtain the minimum input absolute value and energy value of the steering angle while the vehicle's side angle, heading angle and yaw rate are relatively small, so that the safety and comfort of the vehicle are ensured."
8784855,A Robust Adaptive Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have attracted a lot of interest in recent years as a tool to perform various underwater tasks in both civilian and military sectors. As AUVs' dynamics are highly nonlinear, complex, and time-varying, several studies have been conducted to develop an adaptive control based on the intelligent control techniques. This paper proposes an adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy controller (AIT2FC) for an AUV. An AIT2FC is designed to control the position of the vehicle in the XY and XZ planes, namely, surge, pitch, and yaw motions. The adaptation law of the interval type-2 fuzzy consequent parameters is derived based on the sliding mode control (SMC) theory. The adaptive fuzzy controller has been implemented successfully in an AUV to reach the desired trajectory. Simulation results show that better performance was achieved using AIT2FC compared to a fixed fuzzy controller. The robustness of the proposed controller was investigated against external disturbances."
9573338,Fixed-Time Path-Following Control of An Autonomous Vehicle with Path-Dependent Performance and Feasibility Constraints,"Constrained operations for autonomous vehicles have been extensively studied in the literature over the recent years. However, to the best of the authors knowledge, all of the existing works address only constant or time-varying constraint functions. In this work, we study path-dependent constraint requirements, which explicitly depend on the path parameter, instead of depending on the time variable directly. This approach is more practical in reality, where the constraint requirements are often shaped by the environment boundaries. From the system users perspectives, it is also much easier to define constraint functions based on the path parameter. A modified version of the universal barrier function is used in the analysis of pathdependent constraint requirements. We show that under the proposed novel control scheme, the vehicles line-of-sight distance and angle error terms can converge into small sets near the equilibrium with a fixed-time convergence rate, while the pathdependent constraint requirements are satisfied at all time. A simulation and an experiment study further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme."
9327240,Active Disturbance Rejection Control of Path Following Control for Autonomous Ground Vehicles,"Structured uncertainties (e.g. uncertainty of tire cornering stiffness and time-varying longitudinal velocity) and unstructured uncertainties (e.g. nonlinearity of tire model, cross wind disturbance and noises from sensors) exist in the vehicle systems extensively. These uncertainties deteriorate the path following performances greatly, even lead to instabilities in some extreme situations. This paper presents an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme to deal with both structured uncertainties and unstructured uncertainties of path following control for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). Firstly, tracking control of both lateral displacement and yaw angle in path following control is simplified to yaw angle tracking control by constructing a new desired yaw angle. Secondly, considering both structured uncertainties and unstructured uncertainties as a generalized disturbance, an extended state observer (ESO) is employed to estimate the generalized disturbance. The estimation result is considered as a compensated control input. Thirdly, nominal control input is determined by a feedback linearization (FL) controller. Then, Combing both nominal control input and compensated control input results in the final control input. Finally, co-simulations are conducted using Matlab/Simulink and CarSim. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme is superior to the existing two typical approaches in terms of path following performances and robustness."
8812663,A Methodology for the Design of Safety-Compliant and Secure Communication of Autonomous Vehicles,"The automotive industry is increasing its effort towards scientific and technological innovations regarding autonomous vehicles. The expectation is a reduction of road accidents, which are too often caused by human errors. Moreover, technological solutions, such as connected autonomous vehicle platoons, are expected to help humans in emergency situations. In this context, safety and security issues do not yet have a satisfactory answer. In this paper, we address the domain of secure communication among vehicles – especially the issues related to authentication and authorization of inter-vehicular signals and services carrying safety commands. We propose a novel design methodology, where we take a contract-based approach for specifying safety, and combine it in the design flow with the use of the Arrowhead Framework to support security. Furthermore, we present the results through a demo, which employs model-based design for software implementation and the physical realization on autonomous model cars."
9740042,Onboard Sensors-Based Self-Localization for Autonomous Vehicle With Hierarchical Map,"Localization is a fundamental and crucial module for autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing localization methodologies, such as signal-dependent methods (RTK-GPS and Bluetooth), simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and map-based methods, have been utilized in outdoor autonomous driving vehicles and indoor robot positioning. However, they suffer from severe limitations, such as signal-blocked scenes of GPS, computing resource occupation explosion in large-scale scenarios, intolerable time delay, and registration divergence of SLAM/map-based methods. In this article, a self-localization framework, without relying on GPS or any other wireless signals, is proposed. We demonstrate that the proposed homogeneous normal distribution transform algorithm and two-way information interaction mechanism could achieve centimeter-level localization accuracy, which reaches the requirement of autonomous vehicle localization for instantaneity and robustness. In addition, benefitting from hardware and software co-design, the proposed localization approach is extremely light-weighted enough to be operated on an embedded computing system, which is different from other LiDAR localization methods relying on high-performance CPU/GPU. Experiments on a public dataset (Baidu Apollo SouthBay dataset) and real-world verified the effectiveness and advantages of our approach compared with other similar algorithms."

8469058,Launch and Recovery of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle From a Station-Keeping Unmanned Surface Vehicle,"In-water tests of automated launch and recovery (L&R) of a Hydroid REMUS 100 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from a station-keeping 16-ft wave adaptive modular vehicle unmanned surface vehicle (USV) have been conducted to determine the feasibility of developed concepts of operation. The USV is a catamaran with a custom-configured propulsion system that enables it to maintain position and heading on the surface. AUV launch is accomplished through lowering the AUV from the USV top tray to the water surface and releasing it. Recovery is initiated through requiring the AUV to navigate toward an acoustic homing beacon on a taut line suspended from the USV. The taut line serves as docking target and as a connecting link between the two vehicles during L&R. During these operations, the USV approximately keeps station on the water surface. Once the docking is complete, the USV moves forward, towing the AUV as it is extracted onboard the USV via a customized winch mechanism. It was found that for appropriate environmental conditions, L&R of the AUV from a station-keeping USV is an effective alternative to the mobile L&R method using the same vehicles, with the same launch and recovery system."
9388913,Real-Time Predictive Energy Management of Hybrid Electric Heavy Vehicles by Sequential Programming,"With the objective of reducing fuel consumption, this paper presents real-time predictive energy management of hybrid electric heavy vehicles. We propose an optimal control strategy that determines the power split between different vehicle power sources and brakes. Based on model predictive control (MPC) and sequential programming, the optimal trajectories of the vehicle velocity and battery state of charge are found for upcoming horizons with a length of 5-20 km. Then, acceleration and brake pedal positions together with the battery usage are regulated to follow the requested speed and state of charge, which is verified using a high-fidelity vehicle plant model. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a sequential linear program for predictive energy management that is faster and simpler than sequential quadratic programming in tested solvers and provides trajectories that are very close to the best trajectories found by nonlinear programming. The performance of the method is also compared to that of two different sequential quadratic programs."
9304628,Autonomous Vehicle Visual Signals for Pedestrians: Experiments and Design Recommendations,"Autonomous Vehicles (AV) will transform transportation, but also the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians. In the absence of a driver, it is not clear how an AV can communicate its intention to pedestrians. One option is to use visual signals. To advance their design, we conduct four human-participant experiments and evaluate six representative AV visual signals for visibility, intuitiveness, persuasiveness, and usability at pedestrian crossings. Based on the results, we distill twelve practical design recommendations for AV visual signals, with focus on signal pattern design and placement. Moreover, the paper advances the methodology for experimental evaluation of visual signals, including lab, closed-course, and public road tests using an autonomous vehicle. In addition, the paper also reports insights on pedestrian crosswalk behaviours and the impacts of pedestrian trust towards AVs on the behaviors. We hope that this work will constitute valuable input to the ongoing development of international standards for AV lamps, and thus help mature automated driving in general."
8977881,Implementation of a ROS-Based Autonomous Vehicle on an FPGA Board,"Due to the development of high-performance LSIs, autonomous vehicle will be realized in a few years. The FPGA Design Competition is one of the valuable opportunities to demonstrate an autonomous vehicle on miniature roads. In this paper, we develop a ROS-based autonomous vehicle which is implemented on an FPGA board as a mock car. ROS is a common framework designed to implement various types of robots. Utilizing the ROS-based platform, we develop a model car for the demonstration of an autonomous vehicle. The on-board programmable logic is used to off-load the processing of image recognition such as lane detection, traffic signal detection, and obstacle detection. The implementation results demonstrate that we can successfully implement essential components of the vehicle on an FPGA board with the ROS-based system."
9362281,A Data-Driven Method Towards Minimizing Collision Severity for Highly Automated Vehicles,"The deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads calls for the development of methods that are reliably able to mitigate injury severity in case of unavoidable collisions. This study proposes a data-driven motion planning method capable of minimizing injury severity for vehicle occupants in unavoidable collisions. The method is based on establishing a metric that models the relationship between impact location and injury severity using real accident data, and subsequently including it in the cost function of a motion planning framework. The vehicle dynamics and associated constraints are considered through a precomputed trajectory library, which is generated by solving an optimal control problem. This allows for efficient computation as well as an accurate representation of the vehicle. The proposed motion planning approach is evaluated by simulation, and it is shown that the trajectory associated with the minimum cost mitigates the collision severity for occupants of passenger vehicles involved in the collision."
8876718,Trajectory Tracking Control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Based on Fuzzy Re-Planning of a Local Desired Trajectory,"This paper investigates the trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles whose initial starting position differs substantially from that specified by the desired trajectory. This scenario is very likely to cause serious chattering in the control output, especially in the early stages, when the large tracking error is the input to the controller. A novel trajectory tracking control strategy is developed based on fuzzy re-planning of a local desired trajectory. At each time instant, a local desired trajectory is reconstructed based on the AUV's current position and that specified by the original desired trajectory at a future time. Also the control effort is computed based on the local desired trajectory, rather than the original one. Moreover, the interval between each time instant is determined by a new single-input fuzzy model, where the input is determined by the distance between AUV's current and desired trajectories and the change in the distance. Finally, the effectiveness of the new control strategy is verified by simulation-based case studies using an actual vehicle model as a necessary step prior to experimental validation."
9208285,Specifying Route Behaviors of Self-Driving Vehicles in ROS Using Lua Scripting Language with Web Interface,"Implementing software for a large-scale robotics research platform such as an autonomous vehicle requires a system that can quickly adapt to new environments, behaviors, capability requirements, and physical hardware. To solve this problem, the proposed system abstracts sets of low level control into “behaviors” defined using Lua scripts. Behaviors, made of single function definitions or complete modules, may arbitrarily read from the platform's input state and alter the platform's output state during runtime. Complexity is removed from the system by encapsulating lower level behaviors into simple function calls or variable state changes that higher level behaviors use to control the system. An additional benefit of the system is that the behaviors are made available through a web-based user interface which, if the platform supports it, may be accessed remotely and modified while the system is executing. The core system, implemented in ROS, is completely generic and can run on arbitrary platforms by implementing only a few standard interfaces. The design also prioritizes modularity so that hardware can be added or removed from the system quickly; it does not depend on any specific sensor hardware to run. The system was used by Lawrence Technological University's autonomous vehicle team to win the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition for three consecutive years. It has also been used on smaller robotics platforms for research projects and teaching."
9637501,Conceptualisation of Human-on-the-Loop Haptic Teleoperation With Fully Autonomous Self-Driving Vehicles in the Urban Environment,"The automotive industry aims to deploy commercial level-5 fully autonomous self-driving vehicles (FA-SDVs) in a diverse range of benefit-driven concepts on city roads in the years to come. In all future visions of operating networks of FA-SDVs, humans are expected to intervene with some kind of remote supervisory role. Recent advances in cyber-physical systems (CPS) within the concept of Internet of Everything (IoE) using tactile Internet (TI) teleport us to teleoperate remote objects within the cyber-world. Human-on-the-loop (HOTL) haptic teleoperation with an extension of human control and sensing capability by coupling with artificial sensors and actuators with an increased sense of real-time driving in the remote vehicle can help overcome the challenging tasks when the new driver — artificial intelligence (AI) agent — encounters an unorthodox situation that can’t be addressed by the autonomous capabilities. This paper analyses HOTL real-time haptic delay-sensitive teleoperation with FA-SDVs, in the aspects of human-vehicle teamwork by establishing two similar remote parallel worlds — real-world vehicle time-varying environment and cyber-world emulation of this environment, i.e., digital twins (DTs) — in which a human telesupervisor (HTS), as a biological agent, can be immersed with no cybersickness enabling omnipresence through a timely bidirectional flow of energy and information. The experiments conducted as a proof of concept of HOTL haptic teleoperation regarding learning with human-vehicle collaboration show promising results and the potential of benefiting from the proposed framework."
9133275,High-Resolution Vehicle Trajectory Extraction and Denoising From Aerial Videos,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has become an increasingly popular tool for traffic monitoring and data collection on highways due to its advantage of low cost, high resolution, good flexibility, and wide spatial coverage. Extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from aerial videos taken by a UAV flying over target highway segment becomes a critical research task for traffic flow modeling and analysis. This study aims at proposing a novel methodological framework for automatic and accurate vehicle trajectory extraction from aerial videos. The method starts by developing an ensemble detector to detect vehicles in the target region. Then, the kernelized correlation filter is applied to track vehicles fast and accurately. After that, a mapping algorithm is proposed to transform vehicle positions from the Cartesian coordinates in image to the Frenet coordinates to extract raw vehicle trajectories along the roadway curves. The data denoising is then performed using a wavelet transform to eliminate the biased vehicle trajectory positions. Our method is tested on two aerial videos taken on different urban expressway segments in both peak and non-peak hours on weekdays. The extracted vehicle trajectories are compared with manual calibrated data to testify the framework performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method successfully extracts vehicle trajectories with a high accuracy: the measurement error of Mean Squared Deviation is 2.301 m, the Root-mean-square deviation is 0.175 m, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.999. The video and trajectory data in this study are publicly accessible for serving as benchmark at https://seutraffic.com."
9611779,Compensating for Partial Doppler Velocity Log Outages by Using Deep- Learning Approaches,"Autonomous underwater vehicles allow researchers to explore the ocean depths and play an important role in many marine applications. A Doppler velocity log (DVL) is commonly used in autonomous underwater vehicle navigation. It measures four beam velocities to estimate the vehicle velocity vector. When less than four beams are available, the accuracy of the velocity vector estimation degrades or, in some situations, an estimate is not available at all. In real-life scenarios such situations commonly occur when the autonomous underwater vehicles is operating in complex environments or when passing or over trenches in the seafloor. This paper proposes a deep learning approach to compensate for situations of partial beam measurements. To that end, past DVL beam measurements are plugged into a dedicated network to regress the missing beam velocity. Once obtained, it is combined with the other three measured DVL beams to estimate the vehicle velocity vector. To examine the proposed approach, a simulated dataset of an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with a DVL, was generated. Our results show that the proposed approach is capable of accurately estimating the missing DVL beam and, as a result, improving the estimation of the vehicle velocity vector. Sea experiments, made with the Snapir autonomous underwater vehicle at the Mediterranean sea, shows that the proposed approach works well even with sea recorded data. There, an improvement of more than 57% in the accuracy of the velocity vector estimation was achieved."
9304577,SROM: Simple Real-time Odometry and Mapping using LiDAR data for Autonomous Vehicles,"In this paper, we present SROM, a novel realtime Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system for autonomous vehicles. The keynote of the paper showcases SROM's ability to maintain localization at low sampling rates or at high linear or angular velocities where most popular LiDAR based localization approaches get degraded fast. We also demonstrate SROM to be computationally efficient and capable of handling high-speed maneuvers. It also achieves low drifts without the need for any other sensors like IMU and/or GPS. Our method has a two-layer structure wherein first, an approximate estimate of the rotation angle and translation parameters are calculated using a Phase Only Correlation (POC) method. Next, we use this estimate as an initialization for a point-to-plane ICP algorithm to obtain fine matching and registration. Another key feature of the proposed algorithm is the removal of dynamic objects before matching the scans. This improves the performance of our system as the dynamic objects can corrupt the matching scheme and derail localization. Our SLAM system can build reliable maps at the same time generating high-quality odometry. We exhaustively evaluated the proposed method in many challenging highways/country/urban sequences from the KITTI dataset and the results demonstrate better accuracy in comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods with reduced computational expense aiding in real-time realizations. We have also integrated our SROM system with our in-house autonomous vehicle and compared it with the state-of-the-art methods like LOAM and LeGO-LOAM."
9525230,Optimizing Vehicles Tracking Accuracies while Considering Information Aging,"Connected and autonomous vehicles are expected to revolutionize transportation systems in the near future. Nevertheless, full autonomy still requires further development that will only be achieved through a high level of cooperation and coordination among vehicles. For the safe execution of several autonomous functions, vehicles will need to frequently communicate their current location to the Road Side Units (RSUs). However, due to information aging, it is expected that the delays from the time a message is generated until the location of the vehicle is updated will induce a tracking error. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the frequency of location updates and tracking error. Further, in order to reduce the queue-induced delays present in the system, the number of messages can be reduced by employing an event-triggered communication scheme. In this work, a family of optimization problems is proposed, utilizing the event-triggered algorithm, in order to determine the optimal triggering threshold. Both single and multiple RSU cases are considered in several simulation scenarios, demonstrating that the proposed optimization framework derives the optimal tracking accuracy. In the case of multiple RSUs, results are further optimized by assigning roads (and in turn vehicles) to RSUs if coverage areas of multiple RSUs overlap."
9067077,EKF-Neural Network Observer Based Type-2 Fuzzy Control of Autonomous Vehicles,"This paper proposes a novel robust path-following strategy for autonomous road vehicles based on type-2 fuzzy PID neural network (PIDT2FNN) method coupled to an Extended Kalman Filter-based Fuzzy Neural Network (EKFNN) observer. Uncertain Gaussian membership functions (MFs) are employed to self-adjust the universe of discourse for MFs using the adaptation mechanism derived from Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat's lemma. External disturbances are significant in autonomous vehicles by changing the driving condition. Furthermore, parametric uncertainties related to the physical limits of tires and the change of the vehicle mass may significantly affect the desired performance of autonomous vehicles. The robustness of the proposed controller against the parametric uncertainties and external disturbances is compared with one active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) algorithm, and a linear-quadratic tracking (LQT) method. The obtained results in terms of the maximum error and root mean square error (RMSE), demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm to reach the minimized path-tracking error."
8962820,Dynamic Autonomous Surface Vehicle Control and Applications in Environmental Monitoring,"This paper addresses the problem of robotic operations in the presence of adversarial forces. We presents a complete framework for survey operations: waypoint generation, modelling of forces and tuning the control. In many applications of environmental monitoring, search and exploration, and bathymetric mapping, the vehicle has to traverse in straight lines parallel to each other, ensuring there are no gaps and no redundant coverage. During operations with an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) however, the presence of wind and/or currents produces external forces acting on the vehicle which quite often divert it from its intended path. Similar issues have been encountered during aerial or underwater operations. By measuring these phenomena, wind and current, and modelling their impact on the vessel, actions can be taken to alleviate their effect and ensure the correct trajectory is followed."
8814060,Cooperative Multi-Vehicle Behavior Coordination for Autonomous Driving,"Creating rational driving options and designing the decision process to select the best solution in a traffic situation with multiple participants present is a challenging problem. Other participants could be cooperating communication-enabled autonomous vehicles or vehicles controlled by human drivers with egoistic goals. This work introduces a novel approach to coordinate the behavior of multiple vehicles in generic traffic scenes. Our three-step method generates motion options neglecting vehicle interactions at first. Afterward, a mixed-integer linear optimization problem is solved to find the optimally coordinated motion patterns, followed by an online re-calibration based on the observed behaviors in reality. We demonstrate and evaluate the applicability in an evasive maneuver requiring vehicle interaction in detail and also present an intersection scenario. We further show that cooperative behavior, as well as egoistic driver intentions, can be handled safely and analyze the properties of the proposed solution."
9216422,Perspective on the reliability behavior of intelligent transport systems during the transition phase from legacy vehicles to autonomous and connected ones: four-road intersections as a case study,"We can find in the literature many research papers and technical reports tackling various problems related to the Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Vehicle to everything (V2X) paradigms. However, safety guarantee of these technologies is the most critical problem to deal with because of its direct relation with human life. On one hand, we can find fewer works than the former, regarding the jointly study of the situations related to both AV and V2X. On the other hand, at our best of knowledge, there is no work investigating reliability in the transition phase when just a few of the Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) are part of the traffic road. In this paper we explore this research gap, by analyzing and evaluating reliability of various CAV densities in the special case of four road intersection and for low traffic density. The results show that the convergence speed of reliability functions series to the reliability function of the system when only CAV populate the roads are not constant. This leads to the need of establishing solutions for the transitional phase to accompany the penetration process of the CAV in the automotive market."
8827554,Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles With Simultaneous Arrival in Ocean Environment,"This article focuses on the time-minimum path planning problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with the constraint of simultaneous arrival in an ocean environment. The overall framework can be divided into two successive modules, and both of them are solved by the biased min-consensus (BMC) method, which introduces the edge weight into the standard min-consensus protocol. The first module plans each AUV's path under the BMC protocol, respectively, along which the AUV will avoid obstacles and navigate to the destination with the minimum time through the ocean current. Incorporating the cooperative constraint of simultaneous arrival, the second part chooses the AUV path with the maximal voyage time as a benchmark, and replans other AUVs' paths using the BMC method until their corresponding voyage time is approximately equal to the benchmark. The simulation results in various scenarios demonstrate the strong applicability and high effectiveness of our method."
8645792,Toward the Generation of Mission Plans for Operation of Autonomous Marine Vehicles in Confined Areas,"Mission planning for autonomous marine vehicle operations normally considers journeys over long periods of time. Due to these long transit times, obstacles and hazards may be treated as independent. However, when docking, or operating in other similarly spatially constrained environments, this model may no longer be appropriate. In particular, the space between obstacles and the resultant constraints on vehicle motion may dominate the required planning model. This becomes important when considering the model of planning complex autonomous actions. Autonomous Surface vessels are increasing in capability to the point where they will be able to independently plan and execute complex tasks including many different spatially related subtasks. For an efficient selection of such tasks to be performed, the ability to explore and evaluate potential future states is required. To allow such exploration, the complex real-world environment must be reduced to a simplified model comprehensive enough to allow effective planning while still maintaining the simplicity required for effective search to be performed on future states. This paper discusses an alternate model for planning using a Delaunay triangulation for the creation of maritime planning domains in spatially constrained environments. Using data and tasks from the 2016 Maritime RobotX competition, this model is evaluated to assess the effectiveness and safety of the generated plans. The use of a Delaunay triangulation within this environment is shown to reliably generate mission plans that cover large and complex obstacle fields while selecting achievable paths and meeting task constraints."
9242943,Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Steering Control for Omnidirectional Autonomous Vehicle,"This paper presents a position trajectory control and velocity trajectory feedforward control scheme implemented in the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMAC) steering servo control for omnidirectional autonomous intelligent vehicles. With this proposed control scheme, smooth and accurate steering motion can be achieved with minimized dynamic acceleration and deceleration current. Depending on the application requirements, the end-users of autonomous vehicles will have the freedom to configure the dynamic performance of the steering servo motion with proper settings of the maximum steering speed and the maximum steering motion acceleration rate."
9430762,"Detection and Isolation of Sensor Attacks for Autonomous Vehicles: Framework, Algorithms, and Validation","This paper investigates the cyber-security problem for autonomous vehicles under sensor attacks. In particular, a model-based framework is proposed which can detect sensor attacks and identify their sources in order to achieve the secure localization of self-driving vehicles. To ensure robustness of the vehicle against cyber-attacks, sensor redundancy is introduced, that is to deploy multiple sensors, each of which provides real-time pose observations of the vehicle. A bank of attack detectors is developed to capture anomalies in each sensor measurement, which is a combination of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a cumulative sum (CUSUM) discriminator. EKFs are employed to estimate the vehicle position and orientation recursively, while each CUSUM discriminator is designed to analyze the residual generated by its combined EKF to detect the possible deviation of the sensor measurement from the expected pose derived according to the mathematical model of the vehicle. To monitor the inconsistency amongst multiple sensor measurements, an auxiliary detector is introduced which fuses observations from multiple sensors. Based on the results of all the detectors, a rule-based isolation scheme is developed to identify the source anomalous sensor. The effectiveness of our proposed framework has been demonstrated on real vehicle data."
8859845,Adaptive Identification Method of Vehicle Modeling According to the Fluctuation of Road and Running Situation in Autonomous Driving,"In recent years, study on autonomous driving has been actively conducted. The model-based control is used as one of control methods of autonomous driving. The model-based control in automated driving requires simple and accurate vehicle model that can accurately represent the state of the vehicle and has low processing load on computer memory. Therefore, we represented the modeling error due to fluctuation of road and dynamic characteristics of the vehicle as the deviation of the front wheel steering angle of the kinematics bicycle model which is a simple model. We propose a method to adaptively identify the vehicle model while estimating the modeling error in real time using Neural Network. In this paper, we apply the vehicle model including modeling error to the model predictive control as an example of model-based control, and verify the usefulness of this study in simulation using CarSim."
9112997,Context-based learning for autonomous vehicles,"This research seeks to prove that Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) approaches are great options for the control of autonomous vehicles. DRQN algorithms are widely used in video game competitions, but not many studies are available for their use in autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present a context-based learning approach using DRQN for driverless vehicles. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of using the DRQN algorithm over others."
8957421,Surround Vehicle Motion Prediction Using LSTM-RNN for Motion Planning of Autonomous Vehicles at Multi-Lane Turn Intersections,"This paper presents a surround vehicle motion prediction algorithm for multi-lane turn intersections using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The motion predictor is trained using the states of subject and surrounding vehicles, which are collected by sensors mounted on an autonomous vehicle. Data on 484 vehicle trajectories were collected from real traffic situations at multi-lane turn intersections. 11,662 and 4,998 samples acquired from the vehicle trajectories were used to train and evaluate the networks, respectively. A motion planner based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) is designed to determine the longitudinal acceleration command based on the predicted states of surrounding vehicles. The future states of the subject vehicle derived by MPC is used as an input feature to reflect the interaction of subject and target vehicles in LSTM-RNN based motion predictor. The proposed algorithm was evaluated in terms of its accuracy and its effects on the motion planning algorithm based on the driving data sets. The improved prediction accuracy substantially increased safety by bounding the prediction error within the safety margin. The application results of the proposed predictor demonstrate the improved recognition timing of the preceding vehicle and the similarity of longitudinal acceleration with drivers."
9485100,Semi-Definite Relaxation-Based ADMM for Cooperative Planning and Control of Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"This paper investigates the cooperative planning and control problem for multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in different scenarios. In the existing literature, most of the methods suffer from significant problems in computational efficiency. Furthermore, as the optimization problem is nonlinear and nonconvex, it typically poses great difficulty in determining the optimal solution. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel and completely parallel computation framework by leveraging the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem in the autonomous driving problem can be divided into two manageable sub-problems; and the resulting sub-problems can be solved by using effective optimization methods in a parallel framework. Here, the differential dynamic programming (DDP) algorithm is capable of addressing the nonlinearity of the system dynamics rather effectively; and the nonconvex coupling constraints with small dimensions can be resolved by invoking the notion of semi-definite relaxation (SDR), which can also be solved in a very short time. Due to the parallel computation and efficient relaxation of nonconvex constraints, our proposed approach effectively realizes real-time implementation; and thus extra assurance of driving safety is provided. In addition, two transportation scenarios for multiple CAVs are used to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."
9294531,Safe Speed Control and Collision Probability Estimation Under Ego-Pose Uncertainty for Autonomous Vehicle,"In order for autonomous vehicles to become a part of the Intelligent Transportation Ecosystem, they are required to guarantee a particular level of safety. For that to happen safe vehicle control algorithms need to be developed, which include assessing the probability of a collision while driving along a given trajectory and selecting control signals that minimize this probability. In this paper, we propose a speed control system that estimates a collision probability taking into account static and dynamic obstacles as well as ego-pose uncertainty and chooses the maximum safe speed. For that, the planned trajectory is converted by the control system into control signals that form the input for the dynamic vehicle model. The model predicts the real vehicle path. The predicted trajectory is generated for each particle - a weighted hypothesis of the localization system about the vehicle pose. Based on the predicted particles' trajectories, the probability of collision is calculated, and a decision is made on the maximum safe speed. The proposed algorithm was validated on the real autonomous vehicle. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed speed control system reduces the vehicle speed to a safe value when performing maneuvers and driving through narrow openings. Therefore the observed behavior of the system is mimicking a human driver behavior when driving in difficult and ambiguous traffic situations."
8820147,Estimation of AUV Hydrodynamic Coefficients Using Analytical and System Identification Approaches,"This article discusses a challenge of the hydrodynamic coefficient identification in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The considered coefficients correspond to a nonlinear mathematical model of an AUV maneuvering in the horizontal plane. The dynamics of underwater vehicles is intrinsically nonlinear. Hence, to reproduce different types of maneuvers, such as straight line, zigzag, or turning in circles, a nonlinear mathematical model is important. The proposed identification approach combines an analytical and semiempirical estimation method (ASE), based on the hydrodynamics and geometric characteristics of submarine vehicles, with a parameter estimator based on the extended Kalman filter. The identification starts with ASE estimations, and then the estimator based on the extended Kalman filter adjusts the hydrodynamic coefficient estimates based on the experimental data. The experimental data were obtained with the sensors of the Pirajuba AUV during sea trials. This identification method is a cyclical estimation process, where the less reliable parameters are adjusted to the experimental data while the most reliable parameters are kept fixed. Therefore, in the next identification iteration, the originally fixed model parameters are adjusted to the experimental data, keeping the already identified values. Finally, the identified model is used to simulate the vehicle's movement, and the movement variables are compared to the experimental data, thus validating the identified model."
9254117,Learning-Based Adaptive Optimal Control for Connected Vehicles in Mixed Traffic: Robustness to Driver Reaction Time,"Through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, both human-driven and autonomous vehicles can actively exchange data, such as velocities and bumper-to-bumper distances. Employing the shared data, control laws with improved performance can be designed for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In this article, taking into account human-vehicle interaction and heterogeneous driver behavior, an adaptive optimal control design method is proposed for a platoon mixed with multiple preceding human-driven vehicles and one CAV at the tail. It is shown that by using reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming techniques, a near-optimal controller can be learned from real-time data for the CAV with V2V communications, but without the precise knowledge of the accurate car-following parameters of any driver in the platoon. The proposed method allows the CAV controller to adapt to different platoon dynamics caused by the unknown and heterogeneous driver-dependent parameters. To improve the safety performance during the learning process, our off-policy learning algorithm can leverage both the historical data and the data collected in real time, which leads to considerably reduced learning time duration. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method is demonstrated by rigorous proofs and microscopic traffic simulations."
8584062,Networking and Communications in Autonomous Driving: A Survey,"The development of light detection and ranging, Radar, camera, and other advanced sensor technologies inaugurated a new era in autonomous driving. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of these sensors, autonomous vehicles are prone to making erroneous decisions and causing serious disasters. At this point, networking and communication technologies can greatly make up for sensor deficiencies, and are more reliable, feasible and efficient to promote the information interaction, thereby improving autonomous vehicle's perception and planning capabilities as well as realizing better vehicle control. This paper surveys the networking and communication technologies in autonomous driving from two aspects: intra- and inter-vehicle. The intra-vehicle network as the basis of realizing autonomous driving connects the on-board electronic parts. The inter-vehicle network is the medium for interaction between vehicles and outside information. In addition, we present the new trends of communication technologies in autonomous driving, as well as investigate the current mainstream verification methods and emphasize the challenges and open issues of networking and communications in autonomous driving."
9737190,Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles' Strategy in Triple-Lane Roundabout Intersections,"The efficiency of roundabout intersections plays a vital role in traffic flow. With the increase of autonomous vehicles on roads in the future, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications would improve traffic efficiency in roundabout intersections. In this paper, we investigate the throughput of a triple-lane roundabout intersection that has no traffic light to see which lane has the minimum waiting time. To do this, we utilize a decision-making algorithm that first determines which lane is the best (has the least waiting time) in each iteration. Then, the algorithm investigates the convergence of the best lane. Finally, the scenarios of a working day and a holiday that have different traffic flows are compared. The results show that there is no preference among lanes in the holiday as we expected. But in the working day, the algorithm converges to one of the lanes."
9616449,Explanations in Autonomous Driving: A Survey,"The automotive industry has witnessed an increasing level of development in the past decades; from manufacturing manually operated vehicles to manufacturing vehicles with a high level of automation. With the recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive companies now employ blackbox AI models to enable vehicles to perceive their environment and make driving decisions with little or no input from a human. With the hope to deploy autonomous vehicles (AV) on a commercial scale, the acceptance of AV by society becomes paramount and may largely depend on their degree of transparency, trustworthiness, and compliance with regulations. The assessment of the compliance of AVs to these acceptance requirements can be facilitated through the provision of explanations for AVs' behaviour. Explainability is therefore seen as an important requirement for AVs. AVs should be able to explain what they have `seen', done, and might do in environments in which they operate. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work in explainable autonomous driving. First, we open by providing a motivation for explanations by highlighting the importance of transparency, accountability, and trust in AVs; and examining existing regulations and standards related to AVs. Second, we identify and categorise the different stakeholders involved in the development, use, and regulation of AVs and elicit their AV explanation requirements. Third, we provide a rigorous review of previous work on explanations for the different AV operations (i.e., perception, localisation, planning, vehicle control, and system management). Finally, we discuss pertinent challenges and provide recommendations including a conceptual framework for AV explainability. This survey aims to provide the fundamental knowledge required of researchers who are interested in explanation provisions in autonomous driving."
9703250,Autonomous Driving on Curvy Roads Without Reliance on Frenet Frame: A Cartesian-Based Trajectory Planning Method,"Curvy roads are a particular type of urban road scenario, wherein the curvature of the road centerline changes drastically. This paper is focused on the trajectory planning task for autonomous driving on a curvy road. The prevalent on-road trajectory planners in the Frenet frame cannot impose accurate restrictions on the trajectory curvature, thus easily making the resultant trajectories beyond the ego vehicle's kinematic capability. Regarding planning in the Cartesian frame, selection-based methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. By contrast, optimization-based methods in the Cartesian frame are more flexible to find optima in the continuous solution space, but the new challenges are how to tackle the intractable collision-avoidance constraints and nonconvex kinematic constraints. An iterative computation framework is proposed to accumulatively handle the complex constraints. Concretely, an intermediate problem is solved in each iteration, which contains linear and tractably scaled collision-avoidance constraints and softened kinematic constraints. Compared with the existing optimization-based planners, our proposal is less sensitive to the initial guess especially when it is not kinematically feasible. The efficiency of the proposed planner is validated by both simulations and real-world experiments. Source codes of this work are available at https://github.com/libai1943/CartesianPlanner."
9157288,Combined Hybrid mm-Waves and Optics Sensing with Smart Data Fusion for Autonomous Vehicles,"Combination of cognitive mm-Wave MIMO Phased Array systems with Optical Sensing solutions is proposed toward new functionalities for environmental perceptions and ubiquitous interactions. The resulting paradigms will operate the unification of mm-Wave and optical sensing solutions for enabling emerging technologies relative to interactions of humans with smart devices and systems in randomly changing environments. Perspectives for Autonomous Vehicles with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) including Gesture-Recognition (GR) through ubiquitous interactions based on hybrid cognitive mm-Wave RFIC technologies and optical systems are drawn. Several hardware realizations of mm-Wave phased-arrays are built and co-assembled with optical systems for smart data fusion and real-time co-array signal processing for autonomously secure decision making process. Unified modeling and measurement platform is proposed with the concept of Multi-Physics (EM-Thermal-Mechanical) Numerial-Co-Simulation-Clone (NCSC), seen as the counter-part of the functional hardware, which enables 4D (space-time evolution) Virtual Prototyping (VP) of augmented reality."
8706541,Underwater Robots: From Remotely Operated Vehicles to Intervention-Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) revolutionized the subsea industry when they were introduced in the 1960s. They were more powerful and inherently safer, and they could go deeper than divers. However, they require a tether and a support ship, which makes their use complex and expensive. Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) have long been seen as a game changer in the exploration and exploitation of the marine environment. Repeated access to remote and hazardous places for data gathering and intervention, enabled by their autonomy, is the key to their adoption. While historically the focus has been on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have recently been developed and adopted at an increasing rate. Interestingly, whereas AMVs (AUVs and USVs) have now been adopted in niche areas (bathymetric surveys and mine countermeasures), they have not yet hit the mainstream. In this article, we review the state of the art in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), which include ROVs and AUVs; current obstacles to their adoption, both technical and commercial; and recent advances in technology. We also present an outlook on the future of these systems."

9527172,Detecting 32 Pedestrian Attributes for Autonomous Vehicles,"Pedestrians are arguably one of the most safety-critical road users to consider for autonomous vehicles in urban areas. In this paper, we address the problem of jointly detecting pedestrians and recognizing 32 pedestrian attributes from a single image. These encompass visual appearance and behavior, and also include the forecasting of road crossing, which is a main safety concern. For this, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model relying on a composite field framework, which achieves both goals in an efficient way. Each field spatially locates pedestrian instances and aggregates attribute predictions over them. This formulation naturally leverages spatial context, making it well suited to low resolution scenarios such as autonomous driving. By increasing the number of attributes jointly learned, we highlight an issue related to the scales of gradients, which arises in MTL with numerous tasks. We solve it by normalizing the gradients coming from different objective functions when they join at the fork in the network architecture during the backward pass, referred to as fork-normalization. Experimental validation is performed on JAAD, a dataset providing numerous attributes for pedestrian analysis from autonomous vehicles, and shows competitive detection and attribute recognition results, as well as a more stable MTL training."
9574480,An Efficientnet Based Method for Autonomous Vehicles Trajectory Prediction,"Autonomous driving refers to the use of computer, network, control, communication and other technologies to achieve real-time control of the vehicle. This technology needs to predict the future trajectory of surrounding moving targets as accurately as possible, and adjust its own driving path as needed. The key to this technology is how to predict the trajectory of the vehicle as accurately as possible based on the data of the vehicle itself, nearby moving objects, and traffic lights. Based on a large amount of processed road data, this paper uses the EfficientNet model to predict the trajectory of autonomous driving. We mainly use the EfficientNet network model to train and test the data set, and use the loss value to adjust the model to improve the accuracy of model prediction. Through experiments, we finally found that the EfficientNet model has better prediction performance than the two models VGG16 and ResNet34."
8835282,Passenger Vehicle Avoidance Time Model For Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"VANET-based Connected and Autonomous Vehicle technology has the potential to improve safety hence reduce road fatalities. Many simulations in VANET develop only message dissemination protocol without considering the safe time needed between moving vehicles and these are rather inaccurate for safety preventions because communications without an effective time gap between vehicles could still lead to collisions. Passenger vehicles avoidance time can be associated with L0 - L2 and L3 - L5 levels of autonomy, dependent on either human-induced deceleration braking or full automated system braking. Two passenger vehicle avoidance time models have been proposed. The results obtained shows marked differences in the needed avoidance time for safe vehicle braking to avoid a crash. A delay of 4s is suggested to maintain a suitable avoidance time between leading and following vehicles for CAVs in urban and highway roads."
9463697,T-S Fuzzy Model Predictive Control for Vehicle Yaw Stability in Nonlinear Region,"Safety at high speed is the most important performance of autonomous vehicle. Wherein, yaw stability control (YSC) is a key technology to improve vehicle safety. However, the high-speed vehicles are easy to be out of control in nonlinear region, which will result in serious accidents. This study proposes a model predictive control (MPC) method based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to realize YSC in the nonlinear region. Firstly, a T-S fuzzy model of vehicle is established based on a two-degree-of-freedom model to describe the vehicle dynamic characteristics in the nonlinear region. Then, a robust MPC is designed and its solution is given in the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) form. Next, a sliding mode controller (SMC) is proposed to prevent wheel lock in the YSC process. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified in simulations and experiments. The results show that the proposed strategy has similar performance in vehicle stable region with linear MPC, and shows the ability to suppress the instability of the vehicle in the nonlinear region, and its computation burden is acceptable."

CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios.

8403887,Two-Stage Request Scheduling for Autonomous Vehicle Logistic System,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to play an important role in handling the last mile logistics in intelligent transportation systems thanks to their unmanned nature and full-fledged controllability. Recently, an autonomous vehicle logistic system (AVLS) was proposed, which employs autonomous vehicles to serve logistic requests and utilize the excessive renewable energy generated by distributed generations. In this paper, we propose an optimization problem for AVLS to develop schedules for request allocation, vehicle routing, and battery charging. By considering the unique characteristics of AVLS, the proposed scheduling problem can exploit its advantages in goods delivery and renewable energy utilization over existing logistic request allocation algorithms. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer non-linear program. To improve its scalability, we also devise a two-stage scheduling methodology to approach the optimal solutions of the original problem. We conduct comprehensive simulations to assess the performance of the proposed request scheduling problem and two-stage scheduling methodology. The results indicate that the proposed problem can improve the efficacy of AVLS in terms of total travel distance and utilized renewable energy, and the two-stage methodology can develop near-optimal solutions with notably reduced computation time."

However, how to effectively manage the join and leaving vehicles, and ensure the profit of the platoon leader remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a dynamic AVP management protocol by implementing Ethereum. Vehicle who wants to join and leave the platoon has to communicate with the platoon leader, and all messages will be related to the corresponding transactions regulated by the smart contract. Considering the cost efficiency of the AVP system, a hybrid chain model is constructed. The public chain provides with certification records. All platoon message communication records will be stored on the privacy chain and will be upload to the public chain as platoon operation incident record. The evaluation result and security analysis indicate that our proposed scheme is practical for AVP scenario in terms of both efficient and secure."
9321160,"Optimal 3D UAV base station placement by considering autonomous coverage hole detection, wireless backhaul and user demand","The rising number of technological advanced devices making network coverage planning very challenging tasks for network operators. The transmission quality between the transmitter and the end users has to be optimum for the best performance out of any device. Besides, the presence of coverage hole is also an ongoing issue for operators which cannot be ignored throughout the whole operational stage. Any coverage hole in network operators' coverage region will hamper the communication applications and degrade the reputation of the operator's services. Presently, there are techniques to detect coverage holes such as drive test or minimization of drive test. However, these approaches have many limitations. The extreme costs, outdated information about the radio environment and high time consumption do not allow to meet the requirement competently. To overcome these problems, we take advantage of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Q-learning to autonomously detect coverage hole in a given area and then deploy UAV based base station (UAV-BS) by considering wireless back-haul with the core network and users demand. This machine learning mechanism will help the UAV to eliminate human-in-the-loop (HiTL) model. Later, we formulate an optimisation problem for 3D UAV-BS placement at various angular positions to maximise the number of users associated with the UAV-BS. In summary, we have illustrated a cost-effective as well as time saving approach of detecting coverage hole and providing on-demand coverage in this article."

9304584,Experimental Evaluation of Minimum Swept-Path Control for Autonomous Reversing of Articulated Vehicles,"This paper validates a newly devised control method for autonomous reversing of articulated vehicles called Minimum Swept Path Control (MSPC) [1], [2]. The theory in [1] can be applied to multiple trailers. The main linear optimal controller was implemented on full-sized tractor-semitrailer and B-double (twin trailer) combinations owned by Cambridge Vehicle Dynamic Consortium (CVDC). An inner-loop compensator using the PID method was developed and tuned to track the desired steer angle generated by the main controller.

9173575,Deep Learning Based Autonomous Vehicle Super Resolution DOA Estimation for Safety Driving,"In this paper, a novel system architecture including a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) or a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and multiple autonomous vehicles is considered in vehicle location systems. The location parameters of autonomous vehicles can be estimated based on the deep unfolding technique, which is a recent advance of deep learning. Traditional vehicle location methods such as the global position system (GPS) can only locate the target vehicles with relatively low accuracy. The super resolution cannot be achieved when two vehicles are too close, which means that the safety incidents exist when autonomous vehicles are deployed in future intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Different from the existing massive MIMO or RIS equipped with a regular array such as uniform rectangular array (URA) and uniform circular array (UCA), we exploit a massive MIMO or a RIS equipped with a conformal array extended from traditional regular array. First, the rotation from the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system is achieved based on geometric algebra. Second, 2D-DOA estimation of autonomous vehicles is modeled as a novel block sparse recovery problem. Third, the deep network architecture SBLNet is implemented to learn the nonlinear characteristic from the DOAs of autonomous vehicles and the data received by massive MIMOs or RISs. The 2D-DOA and polarization parameters can be estimated based on SBLNet with relatively low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that SBLNet performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy and successful probability. The SBLNet is also suitable for the practical scenario considering fast moving autonomous vehicles, while, the traditional block sparse recovery methods fail in this complex scenario."

9304840,Developments in Modern GNSS and Its Impact on Autonomous Vehicle Architectures,"This paper surveys a number of recent developments in modern Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and investigates the possible impact on autonomous driving architectures. Modern GNSS now consist of four independent global satellite constellations delivering modernized signals at multiple civil frequencies. New ground monitoring infrastructure, mathematical models, and internet services correct for errors in the GNSS signals at continent scale. Mass-market automotive-grade receiver chipsets are available at low Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP). The result is that GNSS in 2020 delivers better than lane-level accurate localization with 99.99999% integrity guarantees at over 95% availability. In autonomous driving, SAE Level 2 partially autonomous vehicles are now available to consumers, capable of autonomously following lanes and performing basic maneuvers under human supervision. Furthermore, the first pilot programs of SAE Level 4 driverless vehicles are being demonstrated on public roads. However, autonomous driving is not a solved problem. GNSS can help. Specifically, incorporating high-integrity GNSS lane determination into vision-based architectures can unlock lane-level maneuvers and provide oversight to guarantee safety. Incorporating precision GNSS into LiDAR-based systems can unlock robustness and additional fallbacks for safety and utility. Lastly, GNSS provides interoperability through consistent timing and reference frames for future V2X scenarios."

As a worldwide competition for autonomous racecar, the formula student autonomous competition (FSAC) is introduced. The autonomous racecar developed by the authors, who won the champion of the 2017 FSAC, is also introduced. As the key of control framework, an integrated longitudinal/lateral controller is proposed, which is supposed to control the autonomous racecar to the limits on the random racetrack. The longitudinal controller is based on the G-G diagram, which is proposed in our previous work. The lateral controller is designed based on the robust H-infinity output-feedback approach. The particular uncertainties and disturbances of the autonomous racecar, which are caused by limit driving or chassis adjustments, are considered in the controller design. Finally, the proposed controller is demonstrated on the self-developed autonomous racecar.

First, the motion model of multi-AUV cooperative localization system is established. Then, the asynchronous relative observation is obtained when two AUVs meet and the corresponding measurement model is introduced. The state and the covariance matrix of this AUVs group can be easily distributed and calculated on each AUV platform node by using the distributed extend Kalman filtering (DEKF) algorithm. The cooperative localization with the proposed DEKF algorithm was implemented and tested in the simulated environment. The theoretical analysis and simulation results showed that the asynchronous relative observation between AUVs can be effectively fused by the DEKF method."
9201329,Distributed Cooperative MPC for Autonomous Driving in Different Traffic Scenarios,"A cooperative control approach for autonomous vehicles is developed in order to perform different complex traffic maneuvers, e.g., double lane-switching or intersection situations. The problem is formulated as a distributed optimal control problem for a system of multiple autonomous vehicles, and then solved using a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique, where the distributed approach is used to make the problem computationally feasible in real-time. To provide safety, a collision avoidance constraint is introduced, also in a distributed way. In the proposed method, each vehicle computes its own control inputs using estimated states of neighboring vehicles. In addition, a compatibility constraint is defined that takes collision avoidance into account but also ensures that each vehicle does not deviate significantly from what is expected by neighboring vehicles. The method allows us to construct a cost function for several different traffic scenarios. The asymptotic convergence of the system to the desired destination is proven, in the absence of uncertainty, and disturbances, for a sufficiently small MPC control horizon. Simulation results show that the distributed algorithm scales well with increasing number of vehicles."
8734145,Trajectory Planning for Autonomous High-Speed Overtaking in Structured Environments Using Robust MPC,"Automated vehicles are increasingly getting main-streamed and this has pushed development of systems for autonomous manoeuvring (e.g., lane-change, merge, and overtake) to the forefront. A novel framework for situational awareness and trajectory planning to perform autonomous overtaking in high-speed structured environments (e.g., highway and motorway) is presented in this paper. A combination of a potential field like function and reachability sets of a vehicle are used to identify safe zones on a road that the vehicle can navigate towards. These safe zones are provided to a tube-based robust model predictive controller as reference to generate feasible trajectories for combined lateral and longitudinal motion of a vehicle. The strengths of the proposed framework are: 1) it is free from non-convex collision avoidance constraints; 2) it ensures feasibility of trajectory even if decelerating or accelerating while performing lateral motion; and 3) it is real-time implementable. The ability of the proposed framework to plan feasible trajectories for high-speed overtaking is validated in a high-fidelity IPG CarMaker and Simulink co-simulation environment."
9585638,A Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning For Autonomous Vehicles Smart-Platooning,"The development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) envisions the promising technology of future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, the complex road structures and increased vehicles cause traffic congestion and road safety, which eventually leads to horrible accidents. Cooperative driving of AVs, a groundbreaking initiative of vehicle platooning, epitomizes the next wave in vehicular technology through minimizing accident risks, transport times, costs, energy, and fuel consumption. However, the traditional machine learning-based platooning approaches fail to regulate the policy with the dynamic feature of AVs. This paper proposes a hybrid Deep Reinforcement learning and Genetic algorithm for Smart-Platooning (DRG-SP) the AVs. The leverage of the deep reinforcement learning mechanism addresses the computational complexity and accommodates the high dynamic platoon environments. Adopting the Genetic Algorithm in Deep Reinforcement learning overcomes the slow convergence problem and offers long-term performance. The simulation results reveal that the Smart-Platooning effectively forms and maintains the platoons by minimizing traffic congestion and fuel consumption."

Meanwhile, this advance also comes with a higher risk of various security violations on vehicles. In this paper, we study how to detect attacks on autonomous vehicles, and specially focus on physical invariant-based attack detection. A physical invariant (PI) is defined as a property that a physical system always holds, i.e., the evolution of system states (usually measured by sensors) follows immutable physical laws. We first discuss existing research efforts of PI-based attack detection and classify them according to the knowledge of physical invariants and sensor redundancy. Then, we point out several critical challenges on attack detection research efforts including data sets, benchmark and testbeds, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight open problems that offer promising research opportunities."
8911426,Enabling Courteous Vehicle Interactions Through Game-Based and Dynamics-Aware Intent Inference,"This article concerns the open question of creating control policies of autonomous vehicles (AVs) that lead to courteous motion. The study is built on a two-agent interaction between two agents (M and H), where each agent plans its motion by optimizing a trade-off of goal fulfillment, safety, and courtesy losses. The paper has three contributions: First, the “double-blindness” issue in intent inference, i.e., inferring H's intent requires knowledge about H's inference of M's intent, is addressed. An empathetic intent inference algorithm is proposed, where H's intent, along with its inference of M's intent, are jointly inferred. Second, vehicle dynamics is explicitly incorporated into intent inference to acknowledge its influence on decision making in driving by the drivers' knowledge about dynamical properties of surrounding vehicles. Lastly, a courtesy loss that leverages intent inference is introduced. This loss measures the expected additional loss to H caused by M's motion from a baseline where M behaves rationally and in favor of H. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate that (1) joint inference and knowledge about vehicle dynamics are important to intent decoding and motion planning, and (2) the proposed courtesy definition leads to more rational motions than those from an existing definition."
8995954,Path tracking of eight in-wheel-driving autonomous vehicle: controller design and experimental results,"This paper presents the design of an integrated path tracking controller that will drive an eight in-wheel-driving autonomous vehicle with rear-wheel-steering (8WD-RWS) through rapidly varying off-road terrain. This work treats the 8WD-RWS's path tracking in a new manner, by integrating a control allocation algorithm and torque-vectoring control. Particular focus is paid on compound steering gain that significantly influence the obtained controllability and stability. A tracking control law is designed using the state-space equations of motion, for which global asymptotic stability is proven. It was implemented on a newly designed all-terrain vehicle, ""Mission-Terminator"", the NOVERI Racing Team's entry in the Chinese Unmanned System Challenge 2019, a task-based autonomous off-road race. Experimental results from Mission-Terminator demonstrate the ability of the controller to track paths between obstacles, over rough dirt and wavy surface, and through steep slope. It shows a typical cross-track error of less than 0.5 m. In the National Challenge, Mission-Terminator had the fastest task completion time and highest tracking accuracy."

Speed planning affects the safety and smoothness of autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments, and is still an open problem. This paper focuses on how to avoid colliding with around moving vehicles by planning the speed of autonomous vehicles when its driving path is determined. The proposed method combines a heuristic search algorithm and a quadratic optimization algorithm to generate a safe and smooth speed profile for autonomous vehicles. In the interactions with other dynamic vehicles, the planning speed of the autonomous vehicles is adaptive to the changing environments. Finally, the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed method have been validated by the simulation results in two typical interaction scenarios by using Prescan Software."
8865949,Path-Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles with On-line Estimation of Axle Cornering Stiffnesses,"To improve the accuracy and stability of path tracking under critical driving maneuvers, we propose a novel path tracking method for four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicles (4WID-EV). An adaptive prediction model is applied to deal with the strong nonlinearity and time-varying behaviors of tires under critical driving maneuvers. The instantaneous cornering stifffiesses of the prediction model is estimated by an online estimator which combines unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with recursive least square method with adaptive forgetting factor (adaptive FF-RLS). In addition, to handle the dynamics constraints under critical driving maneuvers, the model predictive control with multi-constraints (MMPC) is proposed to calculate the desired steering angle. The joint simulation results under two scenarios indicate that the proposed controller can minimize the path tracking deviations compared with the normal MPC controller, and maintain the stability of autonomous vehicle at high speeds."
8968386,A Cooperative Driving Strategy Based on Velocity Prediction for Connected Vehicles With Robust Path-Following Control,"The autonomous vehicles need to cooperate with the nearby vehicles to ensure driving safety, however, it is challenging to plan and follow the desired trajectory considering the nearby vehicles. This article proposes a cooperative driving strategy for the connected vehicles by integrating vehicle velocity prediction, motion planning, and robust fuzzy path-following control. The system uncertainties are considered to enhance the cooperation between the autonomous vehicle and the nearby vehicle. With the driving information obtained from the connected vehicles technique, the recurrent neural network is used to predict the nearby vehicle velocity. A motion planner is developed to provide the reference trajectory considering the velocity prediction errors. Then, a robust fuzzy path-following controller is designed to track the planned trajectory. The CarSim simulations are conducted to validate the proposed cooperative driving strategy. The simulation results show that the autonomous vehicle can avoid collisions with the nearby vehicle by applying the proposed driving strategy in the overtaking and the lane-changing scenarios."
9447805,A Dynamic Evolution Method for Autonomous Vehicle Groups in a Highway Scene,"Vehicle groups that are composed of autonomous vehicles can increase the perception range of vehicles, and their dynamic evolution can provide guidance for the operation of autonomous vehicles. Most existing studies on vehicle group formation neither propose a standard vehicle group model, nor consider vehicle mobility and dynamic topology of vehicle groups. Instead, they focus on detecting dynamic evolution without predicting it. This work proposes a dynamic evolution method for autonomous vehicle groups. It first defines five vehicle states and their transitions. Then, it proposes an autonomous vehicle group formation method based on vehicle states and formulates an autonomous vehicle group model. Next, it uses meta vehicle group sequences to manage vehicle groups at different times. Finally, it gives detection and prediction methods of vehicle group dynamic evolution. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed method can be used to establish interconnection among autonomous vehicle nodes, detect dynamic evolution characteristics inside a vehicle group precisely, and predict dynamic evolution trends of vehicle groups effectively."

9585517,Perceptual Enhancement for Autonomous Vehicles: Restoring Visually Degraded Images for Context Prediction via Adversarial Training,"Realizing autonomous vehicles is one of the ultimate dreams for humans. However, perceptual information collected by sensors in dynamic and complicated environments, in particular, vision information, may exhibit various types of degradation. This may lead to mispredictions of context followed by more severe consequences. Thus, it is necessary to improve degraded images before employing them for context prediction. To this end, we propose a generative adversarial network to restore images from common types of degradation. The proposed model features a novel architecture with an inverse and a reverse module to address additional attributes between image styles. With the supplementary information, the decoding for restoration can be more precise. In addition, we develop a loss function to stabilize the adversarial training with better training efficiency for the proposed model. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can achieve better restoration performance with high efficiency. It is highly reliable for assisting in context prediction in autonomous vehicles."
9716896,Multi-Objective Asymmetric Sliding Mode Control of Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"The platoon of connected autonomous vehicles plays an essential role in future intelligent transportation. It can improve traffic efficiency and release traffic congestion. However, there are lots of existing challenging problems of the control of connected autonomous vehicles, such as the negative impact caused by wireless communication and disturbance. To solve these challenges, a multi-objective asymmetric sliding mode control strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the asymmetric degree is introduced in the topological matrix. Then, a sliding mode controller is designed targeting platoon's tracking performance. Moreover, Lyapunov analysis are used via Riccati inequality to find the controller's gains and guarantee internal stability and Input-to-output string stability. Finally, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is utilized to find the Pareto optimal asymmetric degree regarding the overall performance of the platoon, including tracking index, fuel consumption, and acceleration standard deviation. Four different information flow topologies, including a random topology are studied. The results indicate that the proposed asymmetric sliding mode controller can ensure platoon's stability while improving its performance. The tracking ability is improved by 54.61% and 75.17%, fuel economy is improved by 0.78% and 6.34% under the Urban Road and Highway Case Study, respectively."

The presented framework consists of a motion planning generator and a cooperative tracking controller. For motion planning, a multi-constrained numerical optimization method is used to generate the obstacle avoidance motion planning for autonomous vehicles according to the individual needs of the passengers.

9523520,Study of Human Comfort in Autonomous Vehicles Using Wearable Sensors,"The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has depicted a promising future of a safer and more efficient transportation system. To better induce this revolution, massive efforts have been spent on the technical competence of AVs. However, the human comfort in AVs has been an under-discussed yet important topic to the user acceptance of AVs. For the detection of human comfort, existing studies focus more on the physical influential factors of comfort such as sitting posture, vibration, and noise. With the introduction of AVs, psychological factors also have gained greater influence on human comfort. Despite existing studies of exploring correlations between human comfort and some physiological signals in automated driving contexts, there is few study on how human comfort level in AVs can be detected with these physiological signals. In this paper, we developed effective human comfort study approaches in autonomous vehicles with wearable sensors. We also proposed a machine learning based approach with adaptive feature selection to detect human comfort levels based on the wearable sensing data. The experimental results illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in studying human comfort in AVs."
9646479,DeepSuite: A Test Suite Optimizer for Autonomous Vehicles,"Deep learning (DL) brings autonomous vehicles (AVs) close to reality. However, the witness of many safety issues has raised a big concern about the reliability of AVs. To solve this problem, much research has been done to test deep learning-driven AVs. Generally, once a test input is produced, a developer needs to manually check its expected output. However, there often exists massive unlabeled test data (e.g., raw context traces in the real world). It is impractical to manually label all test inputs. Despite some works on automatic generation of test oracles, they are either task-specific or constrained to synthetic inputs. In this paper, we present a general and extensible framework, Deepsuite, to mitigate the manual effort of generating test oracles. The intuition behind is that not all test inputs are equally worth labelling. With limited testing budget, it is desirable to label a test suite with high diversity and a reasonable size. Due to the large search space, to optimize such test suites is of great challenge. To address it, Deepsuite employs a three-phase optimization method (i.e., selection, crossover, and mutation) to iteratively select representative but non-redundant test suites. Such conflicting profit/cost objectives are attained through a genetic algorithm with a well-defined multi-objective fitness function. In the experiments, we first show that the diversity of tests can be revealed by test criteria. Then, experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of DeepSuite in generating test suites with competitive testing coverage and 68.42% smaller size, which greatly improves the data collection efficiency of testing DL-driven autonomous vehicles."
9248128,Distributed formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles without velocity measurement,"This paper addresses the distributed formation control problem of autonomous underwater vehicles moving in horizontal plane without velocity measurement. A novel output-feedback formation protocol is proposed based on leader-following strategy while assuming that only a subset of followers know the information of leader. First, a distributed observer is designed for each follower to estimate the information of the leader and extended state observers are designed to estimate the unmeasured velocities as well as to recover lumped uncertainties induced by parameter perturbations and external disturbances. Based on the observation results, the formation tracking laws are proposed in kinematic and dynamic level, while desired tracking performance and robustness are guaranteed. It is proved that estimation errors and formation tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero. Simulation results are finally presented to validate the effectiveness of proposed strategy."
9741458,Joint Optimization of Depth and Ego-Motion for Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles,"The three-dimensional (3D) perception of autonomous vehicles is crucial for localization and analysis of the driving environment, while it involves massive computing resources for deep learning, which can't be provided by vehicle-mounted devices. This requires the use of seamless, reliable, and efficient massive connections provided by the 6G network for computing in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework with 6G enabled transport system for joint optimization of depth and ego-motion estimation, which is an important task in 3D perception for autonomous driving. A novel loss based on feature map and quadtree is proposed, which uses feature value loss with quadtree coding instead of photometric loss to merge the feature information at the texture-less region. Besides, we also propose a novel multi-level V-shaped residual network to estimate the depths of the image, which combines the advantages of V-shaped network and residual network, and solves the problem of poor feature extraction results that may be caused by the simple fusion of low-level and high-level features. Lastly, to alleviate the influence of image noise on pose estimation, we propose a number of parallel sub-networks that use RGB image and its feature map as the input of the network. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of the depth map and the localization accuracy and achieves the state-of-the-art performance."
9650783,Bift: A Blockchain-Based Federated Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Machine learning (ML) algorithms are essential components in autonomous driving. In most existing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large amount of driving data collected from multiple vehicles are sent to a central server for unified training. However, data privacy and security have become crucial during the data sharing process. Federated learning for data security has arisen nowadays, it can improve the data privacy of distribute machine learning. However, the malicious attackers can still able to attack the training process. And due to the complete reliance on the central server, federated learning is very fragile. To address the above problem, we propose Bift: a fully decentralized machine learning system combined with federated learning and blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train machine learning models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named PoFL to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks."
9529091,A Decentralized and Coordinated Routing Algorithm for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Aiming for better mobility and more efficient utilization of transportation networks, emergent connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies, and the resulting communication capabilities can produce more coordinated and efficient routing behavior. Current routing strategies either rely on a centralized control system which can fail in scaling, or employ decentralized schemes that yield sub-optimal coordination and accordingly poor system performance. This paper presents a Decentralized Collaborative Time-dependent Shortest Path Algorithm (Dec-CTDSP) with which the CAVs optimize their routes according to the communicated mobility messages from the other CAVs within their connected cluster. These messages are assumed to carry information regarding the vehicles' location, speed, and preferred path to their destination. We analyzed the impacts of this optimization scheme under various levels of CAV market penetration and communication radius. The results of this study reveal (1) Up to 40% improvement in mean system travel time and speed; (2) Up to 45% increase in travel time and speed prediction reliability; (3) A strong correlation between mean system travel time and network usage distribution; and (4) significant improvements in network utilization as a result of Dec-CTDSP.

9480345,Distributed Fixed-Time Leader-Tracking Control for Heterogeneous Uncertain Autonomous Connected Vehicles Platoons,"Longitudinal control for platoons of connected autonomous vehicles is a hot research topic in the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITSs) domain. Most of the existing results solve the platooning problem asymptotically, without ensuring that the consensus could be achieved in a finite settling time. To this aim, in this work we address the problem of guaranteeing the leader-tracking for heterogeneous vehicles platoons in a fixed time despite the presence of external disturbances. To solve this problem, by exploiting the integral sliding mode (ISM) approach and the Lyapunov theory, we propose a distributed control strategy able to ensure the leader-tracking in a finite settling time which is independent from any vehicles initial conditions. The simulation analysis, carried out in two different driving scenarios, confirms the effectiveness of the theoretical derivation."

The results show some differences among the three countries: the United States respondents are the most receptive of autonomous driving, followed by Germany and Japan. Our results can prove useful for automobile companies and suppliers and help them supply adequate autonomous driving services and devices."
9106667,Interacting with Autonomous Platoons: Human Driver’s Adaptive Behaviors in Planned Lane Changes,"With an increasing reliance on autonomous driving technologies, mixed traffic is expected to emerge as a dominant mode in the traffic ecosystem of the coming future, which will drastically change how the human drivers of manual vehicles perceive and interact with autonomous vehicles. From the standpoint of human-automation interaction, a question arises whether it is humans or vehicles algorithms that should adapt themselves to the myriads of traffic situations. To address this question, the current paper recruited eleven participants to a medium-fidelity driving simulation study, and collected driving performance and gaze behaviors during the planned lane changes when they were expected to cut their ways through vehicle platoons of different time headways. The results showed a varying degree of adaptive behaviors and risk attitudes from participants in response to the different headways during the lane change. Due to this large individual variation in mixed traffic interaction, highly adaptive algorithm for autonomous platoon is much desired. In this regard, some behavioral markers for planned lane change was recommended in this paper."

Then the mathematical models for landmark-based navigation are established. Based on the established models, the observability analysis is performed and the result shows that the landmark-based navigation system is observable as long as the observed landmarks are not always on the sub-satellite point. The numerical simulation for a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite is performed, which indicate that the proposed navigation method is effective and feasible."
8937757,A High-Integrity and Low-Cost Navigation System for Autonomous Vehicles,"The introduction of autonomous vehicles can potentially lead to enhanced situational awareness and safety for road transport. However, the performance required for autonomous operations places stringent requirements on the vehicle navigation systems design. Relevant performance measures include not only the accuracy of the system but also its ability to detect sensor faults within a specified Time-to-Alert (TTA) and without generating an excessive number of false alarms. A new integrated navigation system architecture is proposed which utilizes Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), low-cost Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), visual odometry and Vehicle Dynamic Models (VDM). The system design is based on various navigation modes, each with independent failure mechanisms and fault-detection capabilities. A two-step data fusion approach is adopted to optimize the system accuracy and integrity performance. This includes a Knowledge-Based Module (KBM) performing a detailed sensor integrity analysis followed by a conventional Extended Kalman Filer (EKF). CAV navigation integrity requirement (i.e., alert limits and time-to-alert) are considered in the KBM where fault detection probabilities are calculated for each mode and translated to protection levels. A simulation case study is executed to verify the performance of each navigation mode in the presence of faults affecting the individual navigation sensors. Results confirm that the required CAV integrity performances are met, while the inclusion of visual odometry and VDM data provides significant performance enhancements both in terms of accuracy and integrity over existing INS/GNSS systems."

This chapter presents a study aimed at helping the driver while they are driving and for improving pedestrian safety. This study was carried out as part of a road safety project in Morocco and was financed by the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water, in collaboration with the National Center for Scientific and Technical Research. In order to reduce fatal accidents involving pedestrians, much research is being carried out regarding Advanced Driver Assistance System, specifically for the mitigation of pedestrian accidents: “Pedestrian Crash Avoidance Mitigation”. The first major contribution is the creation of the first Moroccan database for pedestrian directions, called SafeRoad. The results show that the SafeRoad database has a lower accuracy compared to that of Daimler. This difference in results may be due to the different environments in which both databases were collected."

9271859,An Integrated Framework of Decision Making and Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles Considering Social Behaviors,"This paper presents a novel integrated approach to deal with the decision making and motion planning for lane-change maneuvers of autonomous vehicle (AV) considering social behaviors of surrounding traffic occupants. Reflected by driving styles and intentions of surrounding vehicles, the social behaviors are taken into consideration during the modelling process. Then, the Stackelberg Game theory is applied to solve the decision-making, which is formulated as a non-cooperative game problem. Besides, potential field is adopted in the motion planning model, which uses different potential functions to describe surrounding vehicles with different behaviors and road constraints. Then, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is utilized to predict the state and trajectory of the autonomous vehicle. Finally, the decision-making and motion planning is then integrated into a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Three testing scenarios considering different social behaviors of surrounding vehicles are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed approach. Testing results show that the integrated approach is able to address different social interactions with other traffic participants, and make proper and safe decisions and planning for autonomous vehicles, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness."

We consider a possibility to use a sensor assembly of personal pocket device (PPD) for direct measurement and remote data processing for UAV positioning and navigation. Deep integration of PPD in human life and variety of PPDs available in market reduce price of UAV navigation system and make possible to process data remotely and independently from PPD model/ type.

9389486,A novel navigation method for autonomous underwater vehicle in the middle water column,"The navigation problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is one of the main reasons that restrict the development of all underwater platforms. In the middle water column where the distance from the seafloor exceeds the Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) bottom lock range, the methods of navigations are mainly relying on acoustics and inertial measurement units (IMUs). This paper proposes a novel navigation method in the middle water column. In this method the sea water is stratified into several reference layers in the vertical depth direction and each reference layer is assumed to have the same current information in a short time. Based on this assumption, the current model can be greatly simplified. With reobservation of these reference layers with the ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profile), the current velocity and vehicle velocity can be estimated by fusion of other low cost sensors such as attitude and depth sensors during the descent. The integration of vehicle velocity can be used for position estimation directly in case of emergency circumstances, and it can provide velocity aiding for the IMU or other methods to increase navigation accuracy. The method has been functional tested in a field experiment in the Thousand Island Lake. The results show that the navigation method is effective."
8753708,An Integrated Threat Assessment Algorithm for Decision-Making of Autonomous Driving Vehicles,"In order to decide a safe and reliable trajectory for autonomous driving vehicles, the threat of surrounding vehicles need to be assessed quantitatively and consider the potential risk. This paper proposes a novel integrated threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system. First, the motion of the surrounding vehicle is predicted probabilistic based on the interact multiple model (IMM) to consider the potential threat. Then, we build an integrated threat assessment function to assess the threat in each state quantitatively and objectively, which synthesizes the existing time-to-collision (TTC), time-headway (TH), and the original proposed time-to-front (TTF). Based on this, the decision-making system is established according to the Markov decision process (MDP) and the feedback value of each decision sequence is calculated by the integrated threat assessment function, thus the safest trajectory for the current moment can be determined by optimal search. Finally, the decision-making system is verified in the overtaking and cut-in scenario by Carsim and Simulink co-simulation. The results show that the proposed threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system can help autonomous vehicles decide a safe trajectory in real-time and maintain good maneuverability."

A technique of control is also presented to allow lane-change control design with vehicle speed planning. The CVP consists of longitudinal and lateral velocity profiles in time and planar geometric domains in the vehicle coordinates, respectively. This article also develops an autonomous-driving control framework with decentralized speed/lateral control using the CVP.

9114993,Two-Echelon Vehicle-Routing Problem: Optimization of Autonomous Delivery Vehicle-Assisted E-Grocery Distribution,"The last mile problem of E-grocery Distribution comprises one of the most costly and highest polluting components of the supply chain in which companies deliver goods to end customers. To reduce transport cost and fuel emissions, a new element of ground-based delivery services, autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs), is included in the E-grocery distribution system for improving delivery efficiency. Thus, the objective of this study is to optimize a two-echelon distribution network for efficient E-grocery delivery, where conventional vans serve the delivery in the first echelon and ADVs serve delivery in the second echelon. The problem is formulated as a two-echelon vehicle routing problem with mixed vehicles (2E-VRP-MV) with a nonlinear objective function, in which the total transport and emission costs are optimized. This optimization is based on the flow assignment at each echelon and to realize routing choice for both the van and ADV. A two-step clustering-based hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (C-GA-PSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. First, the end customers are clustered to the intermediate depots, named satellites, based on the minimized distance and maximized demand. To enhance the efficiency of resolving the 2E-VRP-MV-model, a hybrid GA-PSO algorithm is adopted to solve the vehicle routing problem. Computational results of up to 21, 32, 50, and 100 customers show the effectiveness of the methods developed here. At last, the impacts of the layout of the depot-customer and customer density on the total cost are analyzed. This study sheds light on the tactical planning of the multi-echelon sustainable E-grocery delivery network."

It is created from an improved convolutional neural network, which has two input layers to adapt to the processing of high-dimensional environments. Considering the maneuverability of underactuated AUV under current disturbance, especially, the issue of ocean current disturbance under unknown environments, a dynamic and composite reward function is developed to enable the AUV to reach the destination with obstacle avoidance.

9689959,Performance Analysis of Robust Cooperative Positioning based on GPS/UWB Integration for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"The accurate position is a key requirement for autonomous vehicles. Although Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are widely used in many applications, their performance is often disturbed, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, many studies consider multi-sensor integration and cooperative positioning (CP) approaches to provide additional degrees of freedom to address the shortcomings of GNSS. However, few studies adopted real-world datasets and internode ranging outliers within CP is left untouched, leading to unexpected challenges in practical applications. To address this, we propose a Robust Cooperative Positioning (RCP) scheme that augments the GPS with the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) system. A field experiment is conducted to generate a real-world dataset to evaluate the RCP scheme. Moreover, the analysis of the collected dataset enables us to optimise a simple but effective Robust Kalman Filter (RKF) to mitigate the influence of outlier measurements and improve the robustness of the proposed solution. Finally, a simulated dataset is derived from the real-world data to comprehensively study the performance of the proposed RCP method in urban canyon scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed solution can crucially improve positioning performance when the number of visible GPS satellite is limited and is robust against various adverse effects in such environments."
9529225,Robust Backstepping Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control for Autonomous Vehicle Path Following,"This paper focuses on the path following control problems for autonomous driving vehicles. Aiming at enhancing the robustness and attenuating the chattering phenomenon, a super-twisting sliding mode control algorithm (STA) is developed based on Lyapunov theory, where the proof of the stability of the control system is presented by applying the backstepping technique. Moreover, co-simulation between Matlab/Simulink and Carsim is carried out to verify the path following control performance. In this research, Stanley controller, conventional sliding mode control (SMC), and model predictive control (MPC) are used as the benchmark controllers for evaluating the proposed STA performance. Two driving scenarios are considered in the simulations, including normal driving and fierce driving. To comprehensively assess the control performance and control effort (i.e. magnitude of steering), an integrated and weighted performance evaluation index (IWPEI ) is novelly provided. Simulation results show that the IWPEI of the proposed STA can be reduced by 40.5%, 25.8%, 10.9% in the normal driving scenario; and 62.5%, 24%, 6.8% in the fierce driving scenario as compared with Stanley controller, conventional SMC, and MPC, respectively. The results also indicate that the proposed STA outperforms the conventional SMC in terms of the chattering attenuation, resulting in a smoother front steering wheel angle input and a smoother yaw rate performance. As compared with MPC, the advantage of the proposed STA lies in its much lower computational complexity. Furthermore, the robustness of the controllers is verified by changing the vehicle mass and tire parameters. The proposed STA can reduce the fluctuation of the IWPEI by 22.6%, 22.3%, and 5.9% compared with the benchmark approaches. These results imply that the consideration of system perturbations is very critical in the design of the super-twisting sliding mode controller which can improve the robustness of the autonomous vehicle path fol...

8734314,Path Planning Method Based on Artificial Potential Field and Reinforcement Learning for Intervention AUVs,"In order to realize an intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (I-AUV) to remove sea urchins at affordable cost, a path planning method is proposed. The method consists of two parts. First one is seafloor tracking to observe seafloor. The second one is catching sea urchins. In the first part, the path is produced based on limited environmental information available by low-cost sensors in unknown environment. An artificial potential field based on binary Bayes filter using measurements of a mechanical scanning imaging sonar is used. The method has high real-time performance. The method was verified in the experiment, in which an AUV succeeded in tracking vertical walls keeping the reference distance of 2 m. In the second part, the path is produced based on reinforcement learning in a simulated environment. In the simulation, the agent succeeded in finding a safe path to catch sea urchins in a complex situation."
9500652,AVGuard: A Forensic Investigation Framework for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on on-board sensors and computation capabilities to drive on the road with limited or no human intervention. However, autonomous driving decisions can go wrong for numerous reasons, leading to accidents on the road. The AVs lack a proper forensics investigation framework, which is essential for various reasons such as resolving insurance disputes, investigating attacks, compliance with autonomous driving safety guidelines, etc. To design robust and safe AVs, identifying the actual reason behind any incident involving the AV is crucial. Hence, it is essential to collect meaningful logs from different autonomous driving modules and store them in a secure and tamper-proof way. In this paper, we propose AVGuard, a forensic investigation framework that collects and stores the autonomous driving logs. The framework can generate and verify proofs to ensure the integrity of collected logs while preventing collusion attacks among multiple dishonest parties. The stored logs can be used later by investigators to identify the exact incident. Our proof-of-concept implementation shows that the framework can be integrated with autonomous driving modules efficiently without any significant overheads."
9066934,A Fault Detection and Diagnosis System for Autonomous Vehicles Based on Hybrid Approaches,"An accurate fault detection and diagnosis system is of great importance for autonomous vehicles to prevent the potential hazardous situations. In this paper, we propose a fault detection and diagnosis system based on hybrid approaches. First, to detect the state faults of the autonomous vehicle, One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is adopted to train the boundary curve which separates the safe domain and unsafe domain. Meanwhile, a Kalman filter observer is designed based on the linear kinematic vehicle bicycle model to predict the current position of the vehicle, and after obtaining the residuals between prediction and measurement, Jarque-Bera test is applied to check the normality of the residuals probability distribution to monitor whether the trajectory deviates. Furthermore, we design a fuzzy system to distinguish the types of the detected faults based on a modified neutral network, in which a membership function layer is added after the input layer. With the strong self-learning ability of neutral network, the initial membership function of the fuzzy system is updated through black box test and can indicate the probability of each fault type. Experiments on the real autonomous vehicle platform `Xinda' and performance comparison with other fault detectors validate the effectiveness of these methods and the usability of the fault detection and diagnosis system."
9652676,Estimation of Electric Vehicle Turning Radius Through Machine Learning for Roundabout Cornering,"This paper presents an alternative approach for estimating the turning radius using machine learning technique. While on-board sensors are unable to offer adequate information on vehicle states to the algorithm, vehicle states other than those directly detected by on-board sensors can be inferred using machine learning (ML) approaches based on the collected data. A compact electric vehicle model is used to obtain data and measurements of the vehicle states for different sets of road radius. The augmented basic measurements is fed to an Extra Tree Regression to predict the turning radius of the vehicle. The feasibility of the developed algorithm was tested and validated using performance metrics.

8637808,"Design, Analysis, and Experiments of Preview Path Tracking Control for Autonomous Vehicles","This paper presents a preview steering control algorithm and its closed-loop system analysis and experimental validation for accurate, smooth, and computationally inexpensive path tracking of automated vehicles. The path tracking issue is formulated as an optimal control problem with dynamic disturbance, i.e., the future road curvature. A discrete-time preview controller is then designed on the top of a linear augmented error system, in which the disturbances within a finite preview window are augmented as part of the state vector. The obtained optimal steering control law is in an analytic form and consists of two parts: 1) a feedback control responding to tracking errors and 2) a feedforward control dealing with the future road curvatures. The designed control's nature, capacity, computation load, and underlying mechanism are revealed by the analysis of system responses in the time domain and the frequency domain, theoretical steady-state error, and comparison with the model predictive control (MPC). The algorithm was implemented on an automated vehicle platform, a hybrid Lincoln MKZ. The experimental and simulation results are then presented to demonstrate the improved performance in tracking accuracy, steering smoothness, and computational efficiency compared to the MPC and the full-state feedback control."

8848853,Interactive Trajectory Prediction of Surrounding Road Users for Autonomous Driving Using Structural-LSTM Network,"Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding road users is critical to autonomous driving systems. In mixed traffic flows, road users with different kinds of behaviors and styles bring complexity to the environment, which requires considering interactions among road users when anticipating their future trajectories. This paper presents a long-term interactive trajectory prediction method for surrounding vehicles using a hierarchical multi-sequence learning network. In contrast to non-interactive method which assumes that road users are independent of each other, this method can automatically learn high-level dependencies among multiple interacting vehicles through the proposed structural-LSTM (long short-term memory) network. Specifically, structural-LSTM first assigns one LSTM for each interacting vehicle. Then these LSTMs share their cell states and hidden states with their spatial-neighboring LSTMs by a radial connection, and recurrently analyze the output state of itself as well as the other LSTMs in a deeper layer. Finally based on all output states, the network predicts trajectories for surrounding vehicles. The proposed method is evaluated on the NGSIM dataset, and its results show that satisfyingly accurate prediction performance of long-term trajectories of surrounding vehicles is accessible, e.g., longitudinal and lateral RMS error can be reduced to less than 1.93m and 0.31m over 5s time horizon, respectively."
8751968,MIT Advanced Vehicle Technology Study: Large-Scale Naturalistic Driving Study of Driver Behavior and Interaction With Automation,"Today, and possibly for a long time to come, the full driving task is too complex an activity to be fully formalized as a sensing-acting robotics system that can be explicitly solved through model-based and learning-based approaches in order to achieve full unconstrained vehicle autonomy. Localization, mapping, scene perception, vehicle control, trajectory optimization, and higher-level planning decisions associated with autonomous vehicle development remain full of open challenges. This is especially true for unconstrained, real-world operation where the margin of allowable error is extremely small and the number of edge-cases is extremely large. Until these problems are solved, human beings will remain an integral part of the driving task, monitoring the AI system as it performs anywhere from just over 0% to just under 100% of the driving. The governing objectives of the MIT Advanced Vehicle Technology (MIT-AVT) study are to 1) undertake large-scale real-world driving data collection that includes high-definition video to fuel the development of deep learning-based internal and external perception systems; 2) gain a holistic understanding of how human beings interact with vehicle automation technology by integrating video data with vehicle state data, driver characteristics, mental models, and self-reported experiences with technology; and 3) identify how technology and other factors related to automation adoption and use can be improved in ways that save lives. In pursuing these objectives, we have instrumented 23 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles, 2 Volvo S90 vehicles, 2 Range Rover Evoque, and 2 Cadillac CT6 vehicles for both long-term (over a year per driver) and medium-term (one month per driver) naturalistic driving data collection.

The performance of automatic steering system is affected by external disturbance, parameter perturbation, and real-time ability of control algorithm. First, to develop a high-performance automatic steering control strategy, a vehicle-road system model based on vehicle dynamics and kinematics is established. Then, the system state equation with direction-angle and lateral-position deviations is derived to describe the tracking accuracy. Finally, based on the sliding mode variable structure control method, an automatic steering control algorithm is proposed and verified.

8338390,A Robust Model-Predictive Guidance System for Autonomous Vehicles in Cluttered Environments,"This paper proposes a system for guidance of autonomous vehicles based on a generalized robust model-predictive control (R-MPC) technique. It offers two scenarios, in which R-MPC is used to provide optimized motion plans guaranteed to satisfy constraints and avoid obstacles in the presence of bounded uncertainty. The first scenario involves a military unmanned aerial vehicle flying over a target, while avoiding enemy defenses. The second scenario involves an assistive care robot safely navigating to waypoints throughout a cluttered home. In each case, obstacles are represented as a collection of linear inequality constraints that adapt to changes in the environment. Results show that when R-MPC is formulated using a series of positive-semidefinite relaxations on linear inequality constraints, safe optimum trajectories can be planned by solving a convex quadratic program. When formulated in terms of perturbations on feedback predictions, this solution is guaranteed to be robustly stable."
9419761,Personalized Trajectory Planning and Control of Lane-Change Maneuvers for Autonomous Driving,"With the aims of safe, smart and sustainable future mobility, a personalized approach of trajectory planning and control based on user preferences is developed for lane-change of autonomous vehicles in this paper. First, a safe area during the lane change process is identified by using constraint Delaunay triangulation. Then, an improved rapidly-exploring Random Trees (i-RRT) is developed with B-spline to generate the feasible trajectory cluster, which is subject to the safe area boundaries and the vehicle dynamics. To extract a personalized trajectory from this cluster, we firstly adopt the fuzzy linguistic preference relation (FLPR) method to identify users' preferences on driving, which can be reflected by their subjective objectives including driving safety, ride comfort and vehicle stability. Then, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal situation (TOPSIS) is utilized to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem formulated by considering the user preferences. The algorithms proposed above are integrated, and both simulation and experimental validation are conducted under lane-change scenarios of autonomous driving. Simulation and experiment results show that proposed approach is able to successfully realize personalized trajectory planning and lane-change control, satisfying users' various preferences and simultaneously ensure vehicle safety, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness."
8901098,Decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for 3D Formation of Multirotor Micro Aerial Vehicles with Relative Sensing and Estimation,"In recent years, extensive research is conducted on the coordination and cooperation strategies of multirotor Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) to perform high-level missions such as scientific exploration, search and rescue, intelligence gathering etc. [1], [2]. The main motivator for this interest is the fact that the deployment of multiple vehicles reduces the risk of mission failures and provides higher performance and flexibility through parallelism [3]. Among the main subproblems of cooperative control, formation control is usually an essential component and Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a promising tool to carry out this task deliberately. Since MPC is architecturally flexible and handles the performance and constraints systematically in parallel, it is drawing more attention nowadays [4]. Among MPC methods, especially Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is particularly suitable to control the robots whose fast dynamics are needed to be predicted by nonlinear models and constraints as in multirotor MAVs. Additionally, for large scale systems, Decentralized NMPC (D-NMPC) strategies are advantageous since they address the computational complexity by dividing the overall optimization problem into decoupled subproblems and by reducing communication requirements [4]. Furthermore, in order to deploy highly autonomous multi-rotor MAVs in non-trivial environments, several researchers focus on elaborating local and relative sensing in formation control and try to solve its limitations [5]."

Simulation experiments prove the proposed method can reduce system overshoot and enhance the anti-interference ability of the system with a certain degree of robustness."
8476576,A Localizability Constraint-Based Path Planning Method for Autonomous Vehicles,"During autonomous navigation, environmental information and map noises at different locations may have dissimilar influence on a vehicle's localization process. This implies that the vehicle's localizability, i.e., the ability to localize itself in an environment using laser range finder (LRF) readings, varies over a given map. It is essential to take this factor into consideration when planning a path to avoid large localization errors or placing the vehicle at risk of failure to perform localization. We propose a localizability constraint (LC)-based path planning method for autonomous vehicles which plans the navigation path according to LRF sensor model of the vehicle in an effort to maintain a satisfactory level of localizability throughout the path, as well as to reduce the overall localization error. Our method is not limited to any specific algorithm in the optimization stage. Paths planned with and without LC are compared, and the influence of the LRF sensor model on planning outcomes is discussed through simulations. By conducting comparative experiments on a “JiaoLong” intelligent wheelchair in both indoor and outdoor environments, we show that the proposed method effectively lowers the localization error along the planned paths."
8571191,A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Autonomous Decision Making of Intelligent Vehicles on Highways,"Autonomous decision making is a critical and difficult task for intelligent vehicles in dynamic transportation environments. In this paper, a reinforcement learning approach with value function approximation and feature learning is proposed for autonomous decision making of intelligent vehicles on highways. In the proposed approach, the sequential decision making problem for lane changing and overtaking is modeled as a Markov decision process with multiple goals, including safety, speediness, smoothness, etc. In order to learn optimized policies for autonomous decision-making, a multiobjective approximate policy iteration (MO-API) algorithm is presented. The features for value function approximation are learned in a data-driven way, where sparse kernel-based features or manifold-based features can be constructed based on data samples. Compared with previous RL algorithms such as multiobjective Q-learning, the MO-API approach uses data-driven feature representation for value and policy approximation so that better learning efficiency can be achieved. A highway simulation environment using a 14 degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model was established to generate training data and test the performance of different decision-making methods for intelligent vehicles on highways. The results illustrate the advantages of the proposed MO-API method under different traffic conditions. Furthermore, we also tested the learned decision policy on a real autonomous vehicle to implement overtaking decision and control under normal traffic on highways. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
8721089,How Will the Presence of Autonomous Vehicles Affect the Equilibrium State of Traffic Networks?,"It is known that connected and autonomous vehicles are capable of maintaining shorter headway and distances when they form platoons of vehicles. Thus, such technologies can potentially increase the road capacities of traffic networks. Consequently, it is envisioned that their deployment will also increase the overall network mobility. In this paper, we examine the validity of this expected impact, assuming that drivers select their routes selfishly, in traffic networks with mixed vehicle autonomy, that is, traffic networks with both regular and autonomous vehicles. We consider a nonatomic routing game on a network with inelastic (fixed) demands for a set of network origin destination (O/D) pairs, and study how replacing a fraction of regular vehicles by autonomous vehicles will affect the mobility of the network. Using well-known U.S. Bureau of Public Roads traffic delay models, we show that the resulting Wardrop equilibrium is not necessarily unique for networks with mixed autonomy. Then, we state the conditions under which the total network delay at equilibrium is guaranteed to not increase as the fraction of autonomous vehicles increases. However, we show that when these conditions do not hold, counterintuitive behaviors may occur-the total network delay can grow as the fraction of autonomous cars increases. In particular, we prove that for networks with a single O/D pair, if the road degrees of capacity asymmetry (i.e., the ratio between the road capacity when all vehicles are regular and the road capacity when all vehicles are autonomous) are homogeneous, the total delay is: 1) unique and 2) a nonincreasing continuous function of the fraction of autonomous vehicles in the network. We show that for heterogeneous degrees of capacity asymmetry, the total delay is not unique, and it can further grow as the fraction of autonomous vehicles increases. We demonstrate that similar behaviors may be observed in networks with multiple O/D pairs. We further bound such perfo...

9296563,Multi-Model-Based Local Path Planning Methodology for Autonomous Driving: An Integrated Framework,"Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) need to be able to respond quickly to changes in the dynamic traffic scenario. However, regardless of the changes occurring in traffic scenes, the current local path planning frameworks of ADSs are based on the fixed frequency re-planning path (i.e., running their planning algorithms repeatedly). This planning method makes it difficult to provide a reasonable traveling path, agility, and comfort for driverless vehicles in changing traffic scenarios. Therefore, this article performs an in-depth analysis of the problems of traditional planning frameworks which use a fixed frequency to replan the path and proposes a novel path planning framework that is universal based on multiple-models. The proposed framework divides the planning process into several layers, each of which has different functions. With this framework, the ADS can adaptively adjust the planning process according to the changes in traffic scenes and then provide different path planning algorithms to ensure its safety and flexibility in the process of driving. Moreover, the problems caused by the traditional planning framework can be solved. This framework has been applied to the autonomous vehicle ``Pioneer'', which won first place in the 2019 China Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge (IVFC). The effectiveness and rationality of the integrated framework of local path planning proposed in this article were verified by a large number of tests in real-world traffic scenarios."

Moreover, the use of a LIDAR sensor is extended, along with a stereo camera and also ultrasonic sensor to make it more precise. Then, a calibration system is made for the stereo camera, which will take help from the ultrasonic sensor. Not the only ultrasonic, camera, and LIDAR, and IMU and GPS sensor are used to know the angle of x, y, and z of our vehicle. Both IMU and GPS are helping in the perception and mostly in the RNDF Localization that will be used in the pathfinding, planning, and control. The global Dynamic-Window approach is applied for the path selection algorithm and combining it with the Autonomous System Approach. The speed selection algorithm will decide on the speed limit and the camera. Not only that but the implement the Inter-Vehicle Algorithm is implemented, which makes the vehicles can exchange information with the other vehicles in the radius of the vehicle. Which all of this together can make a safer driving environment, not only for cars but another vehicle as well. Hope this framework can be used for any other vehicle project and becoming the base of all autonomous vehicle."

9071763,Adversarial Impacts on Autonomous Decentralized Lightweight Swarms,"The decreased size and cost of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) has enabled the use of swarms of unmanned autonomous vehicles to accomplish a variety of tasks. By utilizing swarming behaviors, it is possible to efficiently accomplish coordinated tasks while minimizing per-drone computational requirements. Some drones rely on decentralized protocols that exhibit emergent behavior across the swarm. While fully decentralized algorithms remove obvious attack vectors their susceptibility to external influence is less understood. This work investigates the influences that can compromise the functionality of an autonomous swarm leading to hazardous situations and cascading vulnerabilities. When a swarm is tasked with missions involving the safety or health of humans, external influences could have serious consequences. The adversarial swarm in this work utilizes an attack vector embedded within the decentralized movement algorithm of a previously defined autonomous swarm designed to create a perimeter sentry swarm. Various simulations confirm the adversarial swarm's ability to capture significant portions (6-23%) of the perimeter."

Automated driving is one of those hot industries. With the development of autonomous vehicles, higher requirements such as intervention when an accident or system failure occurs mean more problems. Many shortcomings arose during emergencies. For example, the system cannot make a correct judgment in a short time and calculate the most suitable solution. This paper analyzes several algorithms for emergency situations at the current stage of autonomous vehicles from the perspective of computer vision. In addition, this paper finds suitable algorithms by collecting, collating and researching literature. Although these algorithms can solve the problems in most cases, there are still defects. For example, there are problems such as incomplete consideration and insufficient optimization. This paper also proposes possible solutions to the defects of each algorithm: The algorithm of edge recognition algorithm under extreme weather is added. Besides, the HMM model is used to optimize the pedestrian motion recognition algorithm. In addition, the standard of driver behavior recognition is also optimized. It is hoped that autonomous vehicles will have a more comprehensive emergency handling system in the future such as faster emergency response and more accurate decision."
8740897,Line-of-Sight Target Enclosing of an Underactuated Autonomous Surface Vehicle With Experiment Results,"This paper presents a design method for target enclosing of an underactuated autonomous surface vehicle to surround a maneuvering target with time-varying velocity, and both the target and the follower suffer from unknown ocean currents. Specifically, a target-enclosing controller is developed based on a line-of-sight (LOS) guidance and an ocean current estimator, where only the yaw rate is used to stabilize the circular motion around the target. Then, the proposed strategy is extended to the case where the target velocity is unavailable and the ocean currents time-varying. By using the relative range and angle information, an extended state observer is developed to estimate unknown relative velocities together with the ocean currents in real-time. Based on the estimated relative dynamics, a LOS, target-enclosing controller is developed without any velocity information of the target. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed via the Lyapunov theory. Both simulations and experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed LOS, target-enclosing controller for surrounding a maneuvering target."
8842676,Securing Autonomous and Unmanned Vehicles for Mission Assurance,"Unmanned vehicles with varying degrees of autonomy have the potential to deliver substantial operational value across an array of NATO missions, but with new possibilities come new security risks. Before these vehicles can be trusted to properly support a mission, such risks must be identified, assessed, and managed accordingly. However, as the range of the potential applications and capabilities of these vehicles is so vast, and the technology still not mature, it is important to lay a common foundation to derive consistent guidelines and achieve interoperable and effective security capabilities across NATO. This paper summarises preliminary results on common high-level security requirements based on a structured risk assessment of available missions and vehicles. This also includes the development of risk and security models tailored for unmanned and autonomous vehicles that can be refined and extended as new operational concepts and technological applications appear."

This simulator was developed to address a gap in an existing robotic marine vehicle simulation software by producing high-fidelity sensor data from a realistic operating environment and simulating ASV motion dynamics as a direct interface for hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The key functions required for the simulator to be an effective model of the QUT ASV included a high-fidelity camera, LiDAR (Velodyne HDL-32E), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and GPS sensor simulation, as well as buoyancy and physics simulation for vehicle motion and control performance in a spatiotemporally varying modeled sea state. Another key feature of the simulator was the provision to directly interface the Robotic Operating System (ROS) to publish and subscribe to sensor topics (in real time) and allow hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the ASV systems for algorithm development. The fidelity and performance of the simulator was benchmarked against the existing best available alternative simulator, V-Rep, with results shown to demonstrate that the autonomous marine surface vessel simulator achieved improved computational performance and sensor fidelity when simulating above surface marine environments."

9128697,Traffic Simulation of Connected and Autonomous Freight Vehicles to Increase Traffic Throughput via Road Tunnel Networks,"This paper simulates traffic at the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Tunnel, Kent, UK. Using a traffic simulation model, Connected and Autonomous Freight Vehicles (CAV-F) are simulated alongside conventional light goods vehicles, to determine the feasibility of increasing the traffic throughput at the tunnel. The results show that with the use of CAV-F, the overall traffic flow is increased by --33% from current flow of --5,000 vehicles/hr. With the reduction in the headway and standstill distance and increase in scope of intelligent connectivity and traffic speed limit, the average congestion and travel time are reduced even at a higher traffic concentration. By analysing the results, it has thus been possible to highlight the benefits to traffic management and road utilisation by introducing CAV-F into our road network, in the long term."

9544320,A Method for Designing and Analyzing Automotive Software Architecture: A Case Study for an Autonomous Electric Vehicle,"Software complexity is increased in automotive systems because many software functions are required for autonomous driving, electrified vehicles, and connected cars. In addition, autonomous driving requires centralized software that generally decreases evolvability with many connections. Thus, the automotive industry adopted the microservice architecture within the service-oriented architecture (SOA), which was already being used in distributed computing environments in the information and communication technology (ICT) industry. However, the software characteristics of an automotive system are different from those of an ICT system. Automotive software generally fulfills safety and real-time requirements that are not required in ICT software. Another challenge is integrating electric control units (ECUs) because software platforms supporting SOA require relatively high computational power and network bandwidth, which increases ECU cost. Thus, the deployment of software functions must be considered before integrating ECUs to find an optimal design solution for evolvability, dependability, real-time performance, cost, etc. However, many OEMs integrate ECUs based on deploying vehicular features without software architecture. It causes optimality problems during integrating ECUs. We propose component-based sensor-process-actuator architectural style for high-level architecture to handle quality attributes. Software architecture for an autonomous electrified vehicle will be presented with the proposed architectural style. The architecture is used to deploy software components and integrated ECUs with empirical quantitative analysis. Four design patterns for dependability with the architectural style will also be introduced."
9384235,An Intelligent Lane-Changing Behavior Prediction and Decision-Making Strategy for an Autonomous Vehicle,"In the future complex intelligent transportation environments, lane-changing behavior of surrounding vehicles is a significant factor affecting the driving safety. It is necessary to predict the lane-changing behaviors accurately. The driving environments and drivers are the main factors of lane-changing. To comprehensively consider their relationship, this article proposes a prediction method based on a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. First, to highly integrate driving environments with drivers, drivers’ cognitive processes of driving environments are simulated using FIS. Fuzzy rules are formulated based on drivers’ cognition, and then driving environments information can be transformed into lane-changing feasibility. Second, the obtained lane-changing feasibility and corresponding vehicle trajectory are designed as input variables of LSTM neural network to predict the lane-changing behavior. Third, based on the above prediction results, an intelligent decision-making strategy is designed for path planning of autonomous vehicle to ensure driving safety. The prediction method is trained and tested by the next generation simulation (NGSIM) dataset, which is made up of real vehicle trajectories. The accurate rate of the method is 92.40%. Moreover, the decision strategy is simulated and verified in hardware-in-the-loop system. Results show that the strategy can significantly improve the performance of driving in dealing with lane-changing behaviors."

They have installed information and support systems, which may involve several applications and gadgets. A foremost reason on such an initiative could be for an adequate prevention of highway crashes and fatal accidents. Literature shows most of these accidents happen when the vehicle fail to estimate the sharp turns with steering angle. In this work, the focus is on an adequate estimation of the steering angle to minimize these accidents. Firstly, dynamics of vehicle have been derived. Secondly, an Unscented Kalman smoother (UKS) has been built to estimate the nonlinear parameters. Numerical evaluations were made on a vehicle model. Results ensure a better performance and accuracy of the proposed scheme."
9656128,Finding and Tracking a Phytoplankton Patch by a Long-Range Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"Phytoplankton (microscopic algae) play an important role in marine ecology. Resulting from a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes, the distribution of phytoplankton is patchy, particularly in coastal marine ecosystems. Patches of high chlorophyll represent areas where enhanced primary productivity and biogeochemical cycling can occur. The scientific goal is to place observations within these biological hotspots to enable more extensive characterization of the environment and plankton populations. Aerial or satellite remote sensing can detect optical signal originating from phytoplankton within a limited depth range only near the ocean surface, and application of remote sensing is limited by atmospheric clarity. To observe the development of patchy phytoplankton communities in situ, we need the ability to locate and track individual patches. In this article, we present a method for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to autonomously find and climb on a positive horizontal gradient of chlorophyll to locate and track a phytoplankton patch. In two experiments in 2021, a Tethys-class long-range AUV autonomously located and tracked phytoplankton patches in southern Monterey Bay, CA, USA. The experiments demonstrated effectiveness of the method and pointed to the need for increased onboard adaptiveness in autonomous patch finding and tracking."
8743395,Nonlinear Hybrid Impedance Control for Steering Control of Rack-Mounted Electric Power Steering in Autonomous Vehicles,"In this paper, we present an innovative approach to steering control, based on torque overlay, for the smooth and efficient transfer of the steering control from an autonomous driving system to the driver, and to control the pinion angle of the rack-mounted electric power steering for lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. The novelty of our approach lies in the formulation of hybrid impedance control, which employs steering control for both lateral and impedance controls. The proposed method, nonlinear hybrid impedance controller, consists of desired impedance pinion angle generator and a super-twisting sliding mode controller for pinion angle tracking. The desired impedance transfer function of the driver's torque to the steering wheel angle reflects the driver's torque to the steering control. The desired impedance pinion angle is generated using the desired impedance transfer function and the desired pinion angle derived by the lateral controller. The sliding mode control method is designed, based on a super-twisting algorithm for the pinion angle, to track the desired impedance pinion angle. Consequently, without the driver's torque, the proposed method is activated as a pinion angle tracking controller for lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. Moreover, with the driver's torque, the proposed method is activated as an impedance controller."
8818321,Disturbance Observer-Based Fuzzy Adapted S-Surface Controller for Spatial Trajectory Tracking of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"A new adaptive robust control scheme combining the disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) with fuzzy adapted S-Surface control is proposed for trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicle. The main contribution of the proposed method is that control configuration does not require the bounds of uncertainty of the vehicle to be known and disturbances effect can be estimated and rejected. The proposed control law is mainly composed of three parts: a feed forward control along with disturbance estimator, S-Surface control and single input adaptive fuzzy proportional-integral (PI) compensator. The nominal feed forward controller specifies desired closed loop dynamics with extravagance from known preferred acceleration vector. Meanwhile, the disturbance observer and adaptive fuzzy PI control term to compensate the unknown effects that are disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. An additional term as S-Surface control assures fast convergence due to a nonlinear expression in to surface and also enhance stability of the underwater vehicle in oceanic environment. Moreover, the disturbance observer enhances the robustness performance of the adaptive fuzzy system for disturbances that cannot be modeled by fuzzy logic. The stability of closed loop controlled system is proven to be guaranteed according to Lyapunov theory. Finally, numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control method."
9708728,Increasing the Efficiency of Policy Learning for Autonomous Vehicles by Multi-Task Representation Learning,"Driving in a dynamic, multi-agent, and complex urban environment is a difficult task requiring a complex decision-making policy. The learning of such a policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire environment. Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle's environment as images have become a popular choice. Still, they are quite high-dimensional, limiting their use in data-hungry approaches such as reinforcement learning. In this article, we propose to learn a low-dimensional and rich latent representation of the environment by leveraging the knowledge of relevant semantic factors. To do this, we train an encoder-decoder deep neural network to predict multiple application-relevant factors such as the trajectories of other agents and the ego car. Furthermore, we propose a hazard signal based on other vehicles' future trajectories and the planned route which is used in conjunction with the learned latent representation as input to a down-stream policy. We demonstrate that using the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network results in a more informative representation than a standard single-head model. In particular, the proposed representation learning and the hazard signal help reinforcement learning to learn faster, with increased performance and less data than baseline methods."
9184708,Nonlinear stability analysis for an anticipation-memory car following model in the era of autonomous and connected vehicles,"Utilizing vehicles' previous transmitted motion information through information communication technologies (ICT) wirelessly an anticipation-memory (AM) car following model is derived to investigate the effects of anticipating driving behaviour on vehicles' position, velocity, acceleration. The changes of space headway, velocity differences, and memory of driving to the preceding vehicle are presented as a parameters of driving anticipation in autonomous and connected vehicles (ACV) environment. The linear stability is carried out to study the qualitative properties of the AM model. The linear and nonlinear analysis support our newly developed model to illustrate the anticipation driving parameter based on previous motion information as feedback of driving in V2V environment which can effectively enhance the traffic flow stability, and the capacity of roads. All results depict that the AM model can potentially decrease the velocity fluctuations in a traffic flow system comparing to previous existing models."

One important task on autonomous driving vehicles is to correctly recognize different traffic signs. However, the traffic signs in the wild can be in various conditions, e.g., occluded, deteriorated, or vandalized, and not all of them are recognizable. In this work, we propose a novel system that leverages the perception system on autonomous vehicle to identify occluded road signs in real time. Based on transfer learning, we propose the occluded sign classification network (OSCN) that is able to achieve a precision of 96.34% on a real-world dataset."

8998359,Eco-Approach With Traffic Prediction and Experimental Validation for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"This work proposes a fuel efficient vehicle speed control strategy for a connected and autonomous vehicle to pass the intersection (the eco-approach application). A control framework is developed to integrate traffic prediction (enabled by connectivity) and speed optimization. The traffic prediction is based on traffic flow model and can be applied to mixedtraffic scenarios where both connected and non-connected vehicles are on the road. Real-time information from connected vehicles and signal lights provides `partial' measurement of the traffic states. The unknown traffic states are estimated using an observer (Unscented Kalman Filter). Uncertainties in the traffic prediction are systematically considered during the vehicle speed optimization to improve the robustness of the optimal control. Effects of powertrain states (the transmission gear ratio) on fuel consumption are considered as well. The vehicle speed optimization problem is real-time implementable using an efficient nonlinear programming solver. The optimal speed control strategy is evaluated in both a simulated traffic scenario and a real-world traffic scenario. In the simulated traffic scenario, fuel benefits vary from 5.3% to 9.4% as the penetration rate of connectivity increases. This is satisfactory compared to 11.7% fuel benefits with perfect traffic prediction. In the realworld traffic scenario, experimental results show that 6.9% fuel benefits can be achieved with two connected preceding vehicles and 11.2% fuel benefits can be obtained with perfect prediction. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the traffic prediction and the optimal vehicle speed control strategy."
8883388,On exploring the potentialities of autonomous vehicles in urban spatial planning,"Sustainability is nowadays an overarching concept for transport policy and planning around the world. Focusing on urban areas, the problem of congestion, combined with the need to reduce emissions into the atmosphere and increase road safety, has led national and European administrations to develop initiatives to support the so-called ""soft mobility"" (i.e., the mobility of pedestrians, cyclists). On the other hand, the introduction of autonomous vehicles will lead to significant changes in the interaction between traffic flow and infrastructure. Given this premise, the aim of this paper consists of modelling the interaction between urban space and autonomous vehicles mobility to explore possible benefits deriving by their market penetration. In detail, the paper presents a network design problem able to optimally identify which links of the road network can be considered superfluous in an autonomous vehicle scenario and, therefore, can be eliminated, to reuse them for the soft mobility. A case study is presented to show the proposed network design approach."

Thus connected vehicle technologies can potentially remedy data collection limitations of existing urban intersection managements, enhancing the performances of intersection controls such as reducing vehicle delay, reducing vehicle number of stops and improving energy efficiency. This paper reviews optimization-based signal controls for different penetrations of connected vehicles and conventional vehicles environments, autonomous intersection management specific to completely 100% AVs road states, as well as signal-trajectory joint control for different adoptions of conventional vehicles, CVs and AVs mixture environments. Real time data processing, signal timing optimizations, vehicle trajectory motion planning and evaluation frameworks are summarized to highlight the advantages and limitations of respective intersection control paradigms. It is important to recognize that realistic scenarios in comparative assessments for proposed methods need to be achieved in future works. The effectiveness of different approaches is challenging to be compared without complete evaluation frameworks, and sensitivity analysis and hypothesis tests involving variety penetration rates and flow demands should be performed in order to test the stability of methods in different scenarios."

Most of the traditional FTA approaches are based on simulation and often require extensive computing capabilities. This paper proposes a formal FTA approach that can investigate the probability of failure of autonomous systems.

However, the challenge is that the performance of underwater acoustic networks is much lower than that of overwater networks. Existing clustering algorithms cannot adapt to AMS well. Besides, existing routing protocols have not considered using the advantages of the overwater networks performance to improve the transmission performance of the underwater acoustic networks. In this paper, we propose a LEACH-based cross media clustering algorithm (LEACH-CM) and a vector-based cross media routing protocol (VBCM), both of them are applicable to the AMS environment. LEACH-CM can ensure the success rate of data transmission in a high-density node environment. VBCM can effectively select a link with a lower delay based on the estimated link delay. We also verify the effectiveness of LEACH-CM and VBCM through NS3 network simulation."

8648365,A Novel Lane Change Decision-Making Model of Autonomous Vehicle Based on Support Vector Machine,"Autonomous driving is a crucial issue of the automobile industry, and research on lane change is its significant part. Previous works on the autonomous vehicle lane change mainly focused on lane change path planning and path tracking, but autonomous vehicle lane change decision making is rarely mentioned. Therefore, this paper establishes an autonomous lane change decision-making model based on benefit, safety, and tolerance by analyzing the factors of the autonomous vehicle lane change. Then, because of the multi-parameter and non-linearity of the autonomous lane change decision-making process, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with the Bayesian parameters optimization is adopted to solve this problem. Finally, we compare a lane change model based on rules with the proposed SVM model in the test set, and results illustrate that the SVM model performs better than the rule-based lane change model. Moreover, the real car experiment is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the decision model."
9354512,Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Subject to Deception Attacks via a Learning-Based Event-Triggered Mechanism,"This article investigates the problem of event-triggered secure path tracking control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under deception attacks. To relieve the burden of the shareable vehicle communication network and to improve the tracking performance in the presence of deception attacks, a learning-based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed. Different from existing ETMs, the triggering threshold of the proposed mechanism can be dynamically adjusted with conditions of the latest vehicle state. Each vehicle in this study is deemed as an agent, under which a novel control strategy is developed for these autonomous agents with deception attacks. With the assistance of Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the stability and stabilization of the overall system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results."
8886037,Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving within Cooperative Communication System,"The ability to perceive and understand surrounding road-users behaviors is crucial for self-driving vehicles to correctly plan reliable reactions. Computer vision that relies mostly on machine learning techniques enables autonomous vehicles to perform several required tasks such as pedestrian detection. Furthermore, within a fully autonomous driving environment, driverless vehicle has to communicate and share perceived data with its neighboring vehicles for more safe navigation. In this context, our paper proposes a warning notification diffusion solution related to real-time pedestrian presence detection, through an inter-vehicle communication system. To achieve this purpose, pedestrian and vehicle recognition is required. Thus, we implemented intended detectors. We used Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor with the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for the pedestrian detector, and Haar feature-based cascade classifier to reach vehicle detection. The performance evaluation of our solution leads to fairly good detection accuracy around 90% for pedestrian and 88% for vehicle."
9267900,Lagrangian modeling and simulation of the free surface-affected dynamics of underwater vehicles,"The paper deals with the development of a novel simulator for underwater vehicles that takes into account the interaction between the submerged body and the free water surface. By using a Lagrangian approach, the potential flow theory is combined with the 6-DoF equations of motions, in order to derive a mathematical model of the system dynamics to be solved in time-domain. A numerical model is then specifically developed and an extensive simulation campaign is carried out, leading to the Submerged Bodies Simulator (SubBoS). The results highlight an extension of the prediction validity with respect to the state-of-art modeling, typically based on stringent hypotheses on body motion (e.g. small displacements, pure surge motion)."
9523580,RFAP: A Revocable Fine-Grained Access Control Mechanism for Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (AVP) is conceived as a promising solution to enhance the traffic capacity and reduce the energy consumption in the intelligent transportation system. Nevertheless, AVP without security guarantees are prone to various attacks, which probably lead to life-threatening accidents. Motivated by solving this issue, an outsourced attribute-based access control mechanism with direct revocation for AVP (RFAP) is introduced in this paper. Among them, attribute-based encryption is utilized to implement fine-grained access control during the encryption process. Furthermore, RFAP can not only realize the immediate revocation of platoon member who is about to leave the platoon without affecting others, but also achieve secure outsourced decryption with the help of edge computing units for minimizing the computational overhead of decryption on the vehicle side. Security analysis and simulation results indicate that our RFAP mechanism is practical in aspects of security and efficiency."
9729789,Integrity Monitoring of GNSS/INS Based Positioning Systems for Autonomous Vehicles: State-of-the-Art and Open Challenges,"Positioning and navigation are critical functions of automated driving functions, which help autonomous vehicles determine their absolute and relative positions in the environment that they operate. Integrity Monitoring (IM) systems, which are intended to assess the reliability and trustworthiness of the information provided by the navigation systems, are crucial for ensuring the safety of automated driving functions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing IM frameworks for safety-critical navigation applications and expands on the state-of-the-art of the most recent development of such systems for connected automated vehicles. We mainly focus on IM methods for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). However, we also cover IM for map assisted and wireless signal augmented navigation systems, which are promising for high-performance navigation applications, such as automated driving functions. For each main category of solutions, key aspects such as the characteristics of measurement errors and faults related to various data sources are discussed to provide deeper insights into designing of reliable IM systems. Also, some of the major open research challenges to the best knowledge of the authors have been identified and discussed."
8917152,Training Engineers in Autonomous Driving Technologies using Autoware,"Autonomous vehicles are currently being tested and deployed under the control of a small number of companies and research institutions, but eventually level 4 and level 5 vehicles will become accessible to the end consumer. This means that autonomous driving technologies must be well understood, not only by researchers and highly specialized engineers at large manufacturers, but also by managers and salespeople at start-ups and small mobility companies, and the general public. Grasping the essentials of such technologies is key to understand technology limitations, to reduce overconfidence and negligence, to and prevent accidents.In this paper we present our national and international efforts over the past few years in educating engineers from diverse industrial sectors in autonomous driving technologies.

By obtaining the relative state information of neighboring vehicles, two event-triggered fault-tolerant controllers are designed for the two cases of the leader vehicle speed. Then the vehicle platoon system is transformed into error system, and the event-triggered control strategy is designed, in an effort to further save resources. Moreover, by the related theory of Lyapunov, it is shown that the error system is bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
9661967,Research on Overtaking Path Planning of Autonomous Vehicles,"With the advancement of technology, advanced driver assistance systems are becoming more and more mature, and autonomous driving has gradually become the future trend. In the technical field of self-driving cars, the optimal path planning for overtaking is an important key technology for self-driving cars to drive in open fields. In this study, simulation software is used to simulate the dynamics of the vehicle, assuming the distance, coordinates, steering angle, and various parameters are set to find the best path for overtaking. This research uses simulation software as a platform, establishes a radar model in the simulation software, and uses Kalman filter to achieve vehicle simulation tracking and detection. Through radar measurement, tracking the environment around the vehicle, the research results show that the actual vehicle simulation result is very close to the Kalman filter radar simulation and an appropriate overtaking path is obtained."
8744521,Next-Generation Interchange Control Based on Centralized Management of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"With the rapid advancement of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) in terms of testing and usage, the implementation of the autonomous interchange in the real world has become more realistic than before. Since the beginning of the last decade, the concept of autonomous intersection has been developed with slightly different techniques. This paper introduces a next-generation interchange control algorithm (NIC) that deals with service interchange terminals for the CAV with the ability to adjust the dimensions and geometric designs. It proposes six different geometric designs that have been modeled in a simulation software package (VISSIM) to employ the NIC algorithm. The system depicted a real-world scenario of an interchange with a slight modification on the geometric design to provide smoother entry to the interchange terminal. The analysis of the proposed designs in terms of throughput, capacity, delay, and volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio indicated different performance measurements based on the analyzed traffic movements. Tight turn with one left dedicated turn provided the highest performance, while wide turn with two left shared turns indicated the lowest performance. Both NIC designs demonstrated significantly higher throughputs and significantly lower delays compared to a current traffic signal system. By applying the NIC with the existence of the CAV, the operation of highway interchange can be significantly improved."
9430761,Performance Evaluation of Station-Based Autonomous On-Demand Car-Sharing Systems,"Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems hold potential promise for addressing urban mobility challenges. Their key principle is to utilize fleets of shared self-driving vehicles to respond to customer demand on flexible routes in real-time. This research investigates station-based AMoD car-sharing systems and uses scenario analyses to identify plausible future paths for their deployment. A traffic simulation model which implements real-time rebalancing of idle vehicles is developed to evaluate their performance under uncertain travel demands. Unlike other literature which assumed homogeneous demand and resulted in low increases in vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT), this study relied on realistic heterogeneous demand and showed a significant increase in VKT. A case study for Melbourne demonstrated the impacts and showed that while AMoD can meet the demand for travel using only 16% of the current vehicle fleet, they would produce 77% increase in VKT. This would significantly increase congestion in any real-world scenario and goes against the hype of AMoD being the answer to congestion problems."
9338642,Predictive Compensation-Based Handling Stability Control Systems for Autonomous Vehicles under Transient Crosswind,"The strong transient crosswind has huge impact on the driving state of the autonomous vehicles, which requires the control system with good handling stability. Here, a predictive compensation-based handling stability control system (PCHSCS) is developed. The PCHSCS includes three parts: a steering controller, a speed controller, and a predictor. The steering controller is adopted to control the course for resisting the lateral acceleration caused by the crosswind. The speed controller is utilized to maintain the vehicle speed, decreasing the undesired longitudinal acceleration. The predictor is applied to predict the control error and the coupling interference. The predicted information, as compensation, is combined and fed to the speed controller and the steering controller. Simulation proves the PCHSCS can improve the vehicle handling stability under strong transient crosswind conditions."
9099085,Ride Comfort Optimization via Speed Planning and Preview Semi-Active Suspension Control for Autonomous Vehicles on Uneven Roads,"By simultaneously utilizing preview and global road information, a comfort optimization strategy which combines vehicle speed planning and preview semi-active suspension control is designed for autonomous vehicles. Considering that the impact of vehicle speed at the suspension vibration source is always a barrier for preview suspension control, a processing method for the road data is novelly proposed. Then, to utilize the processed data and to handle the nonlinearity of semi-active actuators, a hybrid horizon-varying (HV) model predictive control (MPC) method is given. The method can adapt to speed variation and meanwhile take the most of the road data within a fixed preview length. Further, based on the global information and considering multiple road irregularities in a driving path, a speed planning problem is established in the spatial domain and a dynamic programming based solution is provided. The final speed trajectory can compromise the driving time, vertical vibration and longitudinal acceleration. Various simulation results have been employed to verify the superiority of the hybrid HV-MPC method and the significance of speed and suspension coordination for comfort improvement."
9636591,Gridlock-free Autonomous Parking Lots for Autonomous Vehicles,"Many cities suffer from a shortage of parking spaces. Research in high density parking (HDP) focuses on how to increase the capacity of parking lots by allowing vehicles to block each other but temporarily give way to other vehicles by driving autonomously upon request. Previous works on HDP did not consider mixing different parking strategies and ignored the possibility of gridlock when multiple vehicles move simultaneously. In this paper, we describe the design of autonomous parking lots, which allows the deployment of different parking strategies in different regions in a parking lot. We present algorithms for checking whether adding a vehicle to an autonomous parking lot can lead to gridlock. Our simulation shows that autonomous parking lots can hold 60% more vehicles given the same amount of space."
9204843,Robust Nonlinear Control Using Barrier Lyapunov Function Under Lateral Offset Error Constraint for Lateral Control of Autonomous Vehicles,"In this study, we propose a robust nonlinear control method using the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) under the lateral offset error constraint for lateral control of autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, for the application of the BLF-based control method to lateral control, we propose a second-order lateral dynamics scheme based on the look-ahead distance of the vehicle. In the second-order lateral dynamics, the system functions with unknown parameters, and the external disturbances can be lumped into a disturbance term. The proposed method consists of an extended state observer (ESO) and a nonlinear controller. The ESO is designed to estimate the full state variable and disturbance, including the system modeling and external disturbance. The nonlinear controller is developed using the BLF to compensate for the disturbances and to guarantee the constraint for the lateral offset error. Consequently, the proposed method satisfies the output constraint in the presence of disturbances and modeling uncertainties as well as improves the lateral control performance using only the lateral offset error at the look-ahead distance. The lateral control performance of the proposed method is validated using CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink."
8845757,Driver Inattention Detection in the Context of Next-Generation Autonomous Vehicles Design: A Survey,"Driver inattention is among major contributing factors to traffic accidents. There have been and continue to be efforts by governing bodies, car manufacturers, and researchers to prevent driver inattention or, failing that, to mitigate its effects. Many vehicles nowadays come equipped with driver monitoring systems that can alert the driver to, or compensate for, inattention. Moreover, the research community continues to explore and investigate more robust approaches to deal with inattention. Meanwhile, vehicle automation, to various degrees, is becoming more prevalent, with the human's role in the driving task changing depending on the level of autonomy. This necessitates that inattention detection, moving forward, be studied and designed in view of automation and in the context of a specific level of vehicle autonomy. Driver inattention and vehicle automation interact in a complex way, and that needs to be taken into account in the design of future vehicles. We explore this interaction in this paper in light of research findings, and survey inattention detection systems and attempt to contextualize them within popular frameworks for next-generation autonomous vehicles."

Currently, no method has been implemented in real-time. Thus, this study utilized the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm to detect objects in real-time around the autonomous electric vehicle. The objects were limited to humans, motorcycles, and cars. The results showed that the most compatible YOLO model for the system was the Tiny YOLOv4 model which was built with the darknet framework. The simulation experiment showed that detection accuracy was 80% and was able to transmit information in a form of data location of the object to the microcontroller. A success rate of 100% was obtained from 10 tests. Hence, it showed that the YOLO was able to detect objects and provided input to the steering control system. Meanwhile, the depth information method was used to measure the distance of the object to the vehicle in real-time with an accuracy of 60%. Real-time testing was conducted to test whether the autonomous electric vehicle can avoid objects in front of it by providing input from the detection results of the Tiny- YOLOv4 model object. The success rate of the system in real-time experiments was 100%."
9219224,"Low Cost, Open-Source Platform to Enable Full-Sized Automated Vehicle Research","An open-source vehicle automation methodology, and platform for road vehicles (cars, and trucks) is presented. The platform hardware, and software, based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), are detailed. Two strategies are discussed for enabling the remote control of a vehicle (in this case, an electric 2013 Ford Focus). The first approach used digital filtering of Controller Area Network (CAN) messages. In the case of the test vehicle, this approach allowed for the control of acceleration from a tap-point on the CAN bus, and the OBD-II port. The second approach, based on the emulation of the analog output(s) of a vehicle's accelerator pedal, brake pedal, and steering torque sensors, is more generally applicable and, in the test vehicle, allowed for the full control vehicle acceleration, braking, and steering. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, and platform for vehicle automation research, a very basic low-level velocity, and steering controllers are developed. Additionally a high level path following algorithm was developed. Finally, the system is validated experimentally."

The task assigned to the UAV was to reach the goal position in the shortest amount of time without colliding with any obstacles. Reinforcement learning was performed in a virtual environment created using Gazebo, a virtual environment simulator, to reduce the learning time and cost. Curriculum learning, which consists of two stages was performed for more efficient learning. As a result of learning with two reward models, the maximum goal rates achieved were 71.2% and 88.0%."
9106687,Secure Data Collection Using Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"In recent years, drones have become a practical solution for data collection in both academic and commercial fields. The use of drones allows users to collect data without disrupting the environment and keep safe from dangerous areas such as: military operations and surveillance in locations where maneuverability is difficult. The different data collected via unmanned aerial vehicles include field work GPS coordinates, environmental quality measurements, photographs/video and much more. The data collected by unmanned aerial vehicles may contain sensitive information, leading to an increased value on the security of that data. Without proper security services, information may be used in unforeseen, or even malicious ways, such as planting false information or leaking particularly sensitive data. In this paper we introduce a secure data collection method from wireless sensor nodes using autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. We built a sensor node with multiple sensors designed to collect data for rainfall, temperature, humidity, ultra violet index, and soil moisture. Along with another sensor node with sensors used to collect data from water, we created a wireless sensor network where the sensor data was collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle. The sensor nodes collected environmental data through several sensors which are securely stored in the sensor node itself. The collected data was then transferred securely to a central node mounted on a DJI F450 Flamewheel quad-copter, which was loaded with a predetermined flight path via Mission Planner to perform the autonomous flight. Aside from previous environmental focus, technical improvements were made such as adding a solar battery to the sensor node and implementing energy efficiency in the nodes’ systems while the drone collected data autonomously during a predetermined flight path. This project served as a proof-of-concept that communication with a wireless sensor node has the capability to be deployed for data co...

9442090,Autonomous path planning strategy for water-air amphibious vehicle based on improved A* algorithm,"In order to solve the problem of autonomous path planning for water-air amphibious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a path planning method combining search strategy and improved A* algorithm has been proposed. In view of factors that affect the performance of amphibious vehicle, the cost function containing various heuristic information has been redefined. The classical A* algorithm has been improved and optimized by changing the corresponding cost weights to adjust the function of heuristic information in path planning. At the same time, the judgment of whether there are obstacles between adjacent nodes is added in the traversal process of the algorithm. The simulation result shows that with different cost weights, appropriate amphibious route can be generated through our improved algorithm. Under different constraints, the three-dimensional (3D) route can meet the needs of unmanned water-air amphibious vehicle."

The vehicle kinematical model is transferred to a chain form, and the measurement of vehicle poses is assumed to be affected by noises. An observer is designed to estimate the states, and the estimated states are used as the input to the controller. To design the observer and controller simultaneously, an H ∞ performance index is adopted such that measurement noises are attenuated. Finally, the design problem is converted into a set of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), and a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper."
9389426,T⋆-Lite: A Fast Time-Risk Optimal Motion Planning Algorithm for Multi-Speed Autonomous Vehicles,"In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, called T-Lite, that enables fast time-risk optimal motion planning for variable-speed autonomous vehicles. The T-Lite algorithm is a significantly faster version of the previously developed T algorithm. T-Lite uses the novel time-risk cost function of T; however, instead of a grid-based approach, it uses an asymptotically optimal sampling-based motion planner. Furthermore, it utilizes the recently developed Generalized Multi-speed Dubins Motion-model (GMDM) for sample-to-sample kinodynamic motion planning. The sample-based approach and GMDM significantly reduce the computational burden of T while providing reasonable solution quality. The sample points are drawn from a four-dimensional configuration space consisting of two position coordinates plus vehicle heading and speed. Specifically, T- Lite enables the motion planner to select the vehicle speed and direction based on its proximity to the obstacle to generate faster and safer paths. In this paper, T-Lite is developed using the RRT* motion planner, but adaptation to other motion planners is straightforward and depends on the needs of the planner."
8880379,Autonomous Vehicles Delivery Systems Classification: Introducing a TSP With a Moving Depot,"The vast growth in the e-commerce market has increased the attention to resolving the problem of conveying goods from distribution hubs to final destinations (customers) in the supply chain. The process known as the Last Mile Delivery (LMD) problem has significant challenges such as reducing operational cost or ecological impact and increasing supply chain performance. The inclusion of new technologies such as drones, robots, and the internet of things help tackle these challenges by developing new distribution systems to improve from traditional deliveries methods (delivery person, postal/delivery boxes). However, the use of these technologies brings new operational challenges. For instance, in a combined truck-drone delivery system, the truck serves as a depot from where we load the product to the drone for final delivery to the customers. The depot is now moving unlike in a traditional Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) for which we always assume a fixed depot. This research paper deals with the impact of using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) on the logistics of the LMD. We first present a technological review of the use of AVs in logistics and use it to introduce a classification of the delivery systems based on the parcel/product handover at the time of the last handling before delivery to customers. We describe three categories of handovers, namely, machine-to-person, machine-to-machine, and person-to-machine. We present a new class of vehicle routing problems with a moving depot and formulate two variants of a Discrete Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with a Moving Depot (TSP-MD). We solve the problem using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software and discuss some of the problem characteristics."
9082194,Merging and Diverging Impact on Mixed Traffic of Regular and Autonomous Vehicles,"In the context of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), this paper aims to examine the impacts of CAVs on mixed regular-automated traffic flow with the increase of the market penetration rate, in consideration of on-ramp merging and off-ramp diverging of vehicles. Lane changes are a major part of lateral motions, affecting surrounding vehicles locally and traffic flow collectively. On the basis of reinforcement learning technique, a cooperative lane-changing strategy was first developed to enable farsighted lane-changing behavior by CAVs in favor of traffic efficiency. The 3-lane highway stretch with one on-ramp and one off-ramp was applied in this study. With extensive simulations, the results suggest that the inclusion of CAVs considerably improves traffic flow, mean speed, and traffic capacity. Meanwhile, the existence of on/off-ramps has substantial impacts on the lane-changing processes. This work can shed some light on an aspect of the mixed traffic network dynamics for future mobility."

The paper presents the control design approach, and shows how to recursively construct an outer loop candidate trajectory and an inner iterative LMPC controller that converges to an optimal strategy over both model-driven and data-driven variables. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control logic."
9564777,A Highway Toll Lane Framework that Unites Autonomous Vehicles and High-occupancy Vehicles,"We consider the scenario where human-driven/autonomous vehicles with low/high occupancy are sharing a segment of highway and autonomous vehicles are capable of increasing the traffic throughput by preserving a shorter headway than human-driven vehicles. We propose a toll lane framework where a lane on the highway is reserved freely for autonomous vehicles with high occupancy, which have the greatest capability to increase the social mobility, and the other three classes of vehicles can choose to use the toll lane with a toll or use the other regular lanes freely. All vehicles are assumed to be only interested in minimizing their own travel costs. We explore the resulting lane choice equilibria under the framework and establish desirable properties of the equilibria, which implicitly compare high-occupancy vehicles with autonomous vehicles in terms of their capabilities to increase the social mobility. We further use numerical examples in the optimal toll design, the occupancy threshold design and the policy design problems to clarify the various potential applications of this toll lane framework that unites high-occupancy vehicles and autonomous vehicles. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that systematically studies a toll lane framework that unites autonomous vehicles and high-occupancy vehicles on the roads."

This system can be used in applications of many different areas such as space exploration, defense, search & rescue, and commercial delivery. Mostly minimalist mechanical designs that may provide fulfilling certain tasks are pursued in these applications. In this study we focus on developing two main parts of the system through simulations. The airdrop of the Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to achieve a landing that can guarantee no damage on both the vehicle and the payload and an acceptable range of targeting onto the impact point is studied. Also, upon landing, the control system that can lead the vehicle to have an autonomous drive over an open terrain is designed. The simulation results confirm that the tasks associated with both stages can be conducted in convenience."
9268380,Model Predictive Path Planning Based on Artificial Potential Field and Its Application to Autonomous Lane Change,"In this paper, we propose a vehicle lane change system using model predictive path planning (MPPP) based on the artificial potential field (APF) for speeding vehicles. It is shown that APF has high performance in real-time obstacle avoidance. However, it remains unpractical for self-driving cars because the point model used for the APF ignores the lateral vehicle dynamics for the lane-keeping system. To resolve the problem, this paper introduces a novel curve-fitting method combined with the APF applied to plan a drivable path for autonomous vehicles in the lane change action. The proposed system was validated through MATLAB/Simulink with the empirical kinematic model. The simulation results indicate that the model predictive path planning algorithm is highly effective in high-speed lane change scenarios to avoid dynamic obstacle vehicles."
9672554,Towards the Formal Semantics of Scenario Tests for Autonomous Vehicles,"Testing self-driving components in autonomous vehicles is a challenging task. Such components need to interact with a complex and continuously changing environment, making traditional software testing approaches ineffective or impractical. Scenario-based testing approaches aim to define various traffic situations to support this testing of autonomous components by providing sensor inputs for them while monitoring the output of the actuators. However, we need a formal description of traffic scenarios to measure some coverage metrics or synthesize traffic scenarios. This paper proposes mathematically precise behavior formalization to achieve this by using graph transformation rules. We show that our formalization can cover existing scenario specification implementation, such as Scenic."
8705036,A User Study of Semi-Autonomous and Autonomous Highway Driving: An Interactive Simulation Study,"The aim of this study is to explore user acceptance of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles on a highway through the use of an interactive simulator. Participants were asked to experience driving modes with three different levels of autonomy and complete questionnaires with items selected from traditional and automotive-specific technology acceptance models. The three levels of automation included manual driving (no-automation as a baseline condition), semi-autonomous driving where drivers were able to indicate lane change decisions, and fully autonomous driving. Results indicate that within the limited experience of the interactive simulation, users grew to like the automated system as much as manual control during later portions of the study. Overall, this work suggests that the driver will quickly grow to like automated driving features and may rapidly become less anxious about the loss of control experienced."
9312646,Vehicle-Life Interaction in Fog-Enabled Smart Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Traffic accidents have become a major issue for researchers, academia, government and vehicle manufacturers over the last few years. Many accidents and emergency situations frequently occur on the road. Unfortunately, accidents lead to health injuries, destruction of some infrastructure, bad traffic flow, and more importantly these events cause deaths of hundreds of thousands of people due to not getting treatment in time. Thus, we need to develop an efficient and smart emergency system to ensure the timely arrival of an ambulance service to the place of the accident in order to provide timely medical help to those injured. In addition, we also need to communicate promptly with other entities such as hospitals so that they can make appropriate arrangements and provide timely medical information to emergency personnel on the scene including alerting those related to the injured person(s). In this paper, we have developed an intelligent protocol that uses connected and autonomous vehicles' scenarios in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) so that prompt emergency services can be provided to reduce the death rate caused. The proposed protocol smartly connects with all the relevant entitles during the emergency while maintaining a smooth traffic flow for the arrival of the ambulance service. Moreover, our protocol also mitigates the broadcasting of messages circulating over the network for delay sensitive tasks. The evaluation results, based on the performance metrics such as channel collision, average packet delay, packet loss, and routing-overhead demonstrate that our proposed protocol outperforms previously proposed protocols such as Emergency Message Dissemination for Vehicular (EMDV), Contention Based Broadcasting (CBB), and Particle Swarm Optimization Contention-based Broadcast (PCBB) protocols. Finally, we discuss several issues and challenges that need to be addressed in the network in order to achieve more a reliable, efficient, connected, and autonomous veh...

8962532,Intelligent Risk-Based Under-Ice Altitude Control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are effective platforms for mapping and monitoring under the sea ice. However, under-ice operations impose demanding requirements to the system, as it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, harsh environmental conditions and reduced capabilities of the navigational sensors. This paper proposes a method for intelligent risk-based under-ice altitude control for AUVs. Firstly, an altitude guidance law for following a contour of an ice surface via pitch control using measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL) is proposed. Furthermore, a Bayesian network for probabilistic reasoning over the current state of risk during the operation is developed. This network is then extended to a decision network for autonomous risk-based selection and reselection of the setpoint for the altitude controller, balancing the trade-off between the reward of the setpoint and the risk involved. This will improve the system safety and reliability. Results from a simulation study are presented in order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method."

9283828,Mission Assurance for Autonomous Undersea Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles are all but inevitable, and assurance that they will behave safely with respect to passengers, as well as bystanders incidentally exposed to them, is moving forward, albeit slowly. The state of the art often involves stopping the vehicle, perhaps after diverting it to a nearby safe place. While this is good news, it does not fully realize the benefits of autonomy. Autonomous vehicles are built for a purpose; call it a mission. Being able to perform the mission, or part of it, while experiencing faults (or cyber-attack) should be a factor in determining the vehicle's suitability for the mission. This paper explores the state of the art in achieving autonomous mission assurance in the context of autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs). It identifies gaps in the literature and proposes a novel plan to address certain gaps."

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end car-following framework that, based on high dimensional RGB-D features only, it ensures autonomous driving by following the actions of a leader car while taking into account other environmental factors (e.g. pedestrians, sidewalk crashing, etc.) To this end, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, precisely an improved Deep Q-Network algorithm, is designed to avoid crashes with the leader car and its detection loss while effectively driving on road. The model is trained and tested using the CARLA simulator in different environments. Our preliminary tests show promising results for enhancing the driving capabilities of autonomous vehicles in many situations such as highways, one-way roads, and no-overtaking roads."

When the relevant conditions are met, the vehicle executes the lane-changing action, otherwise it continues to maintain the car following state. In this paper, the lane-changing trajectory is generated based on the general model of the fifth degree polynomial, and the relatively optimal lane-changing trajectory is selected by calculating the value of the loss function. Finally, it is verified and analyzed through the MATLAB simulation environment. The results show that the method proposed in this paper has achieved a significant improvement in the safety and stability of the lane changing action."

Thus, Indonesia has the potential to develop marine tourism. In order to attract tourists to enjoy the sea view, it is necessary to provide a safe transportation with a small risk. One of the vehicles that can be used to support the marine tourism is an unmanned ship or Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV). ASV can move without any crew and it can be controlled from distance. This study uses a Touristant ASV with a length of 4.12 meters, a diameter of 1.625 m and a height of 1.027 meters. The contribution of this paper is the estimation of a Touristant ASV trajectory via its nonlinear model under some noises by using Square Root Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnSRKF) method.

9565853,A Multimodal Perception-Driven Self Evolving Autonomous Ground Vehicle,"Increasingly complex automated driving functions, specifically those associated with free space detection (FSD), are delegated to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). If the dataset used to train the network lacks diversity, modality, or sufficient quantities, the driver policy that controls the vehicle may induce safety risks. Although most autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) perform well in structured surroundings, the need for human intervention significantly rises when presented with unstructured niche environments. To this end, we developed an AGV for seamless indoor and outdoor navigation to collect realistic multimodal data streams. We demonstrate one application of the AGV when applied to a self-evolving FSD framework that leverages online active machine-learning (ML) paradigms and sensor data fusion. In essence, the self-evolving AGV queries image data against a reliable data stream, ultrasound, before fusing the sensor data to improve robustness. We compare the proposed framework to one of the most prominent free space segmentation methods, DeepLabV3+ [1]. DeepLabV3+ [1] is a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model composed of a CNN and an autodecoder. In consonance with the results, the proposed framework outperforms DeepLabV3+ [1]. The performance of the proposed framework is attributed to its ability to self-learn free space. This combination of online and active ML removes the need for large datasets typically required by a CNN. Moreover, this technique provides case-specific free space classifications based on the information gathered from the scenario at hand."

In this study, virtual targets are designed to cope with oncoming vehicles in the blind zone at the intersection for safety. The true field of view (FOV) of cognitive sensors and the virtual target states are constructed based on the sensor specification and intersection road information from a high-definition (HD) map. The future states and intention of sensor-detected targets are inferred and predicted with an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter. The local IMM filters are employed with an intelligent driver model (IDM). Based on predicted target states, two driving modes-""cross"" and ""stop""-under three different intersection stages-""approach,"" ""intersection in,"" and ""intersection out""-are determined. The model predictive control (MPC) is formulated to determine the control inputs of acceleration with human driving characteristics-based constraints. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulation to indicate the effectiveness of the virtual target.

9294692,Nonlinear Curvature Modeling for MPC of Autonomous Vehicles,"This paper investigates how to compensate for curvature response mismatch in lateral Model Predictive Control (MPC) of an autonomous vehicle. The standard kinematic bicycle model does not describe accurately the vehicle yaw-rate dynamics, leading to inaccurate motion prediction when used in MPC. Therefore, the standard model is extended with a nonlinear function that maps the curvature response of the vehicle to a given request. Experimental data shows that a two Gaussian functions approximation gives an accurate description of this mapping. Both simulation and experimental results show that the corresponding modified model significantly improves the control performance when using Reference Aware MPC for autonomous driving of a Scania heavy-duty construction truck."

9559998,A Survey on Motion Prediction of Pedestrians and Vehicles for Autonomous Driving,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) industry has evolved rapidly during the past decade. Research and development in each sub-module (perception, state estimation, motion planning etc.) of AVs has seen a boost, both on the hardware (variety of new sensors) and the software sides (state-of-the-art algorithms). With recent advancements in achieving real-time performance using onboard computational hardware on an ego vehicle, one of the major challenges that AV industry faces today is modelling behaviour and predicting future intentions of road users. To make a self-driving car reason and execute the safest motion plan, it should be able to understand its interactions with other road users. Modelling such behaviour is not trivial and involves various factors e.g. demographics, number of traffic participants, environmental conditions, traffic rules, contextual cues etc. This comprehensive review summarizes the related literature. Specifically, we identify and classify motion prediction literature for two road user classes i.e. pedestrians and vehicles. The taxonomy proposed in this review gives a unified generic overview of the pedestrian and vehicle motion prediction literature and is built on three dimensions i.e. motion modelling approach, model output type, and situational awareness from the perspective of an AV."
9564486,Learning-Based Vehicle Dynamics Residual Correction Model for Autonomous Driving Simulation,"An accurate vehicle dynamics model serves as a virtual car in simulation. It reflects realistic vehicle behavior under control command sequences to assist with autonomous driving algorithm development. We present a learning-based modeling method to generate a high-accuracy vehicle dynamics model, i.e., the residual correction vehicle dynamics model. Given an existing vehicle dynamics model as a dynamics base model, a residual predictor uses a multi-loss Gaussian regression process to predict the dynamics residuals of the base model from the encoded history of base model predictions and control commands. The accuracy of vehicle dynamics model is improved in heading, speed as well as trajectory. By design a multi-loss Gaussian regression process, the model predicted vehicle dynamics states has less difference compared to the ground truth. An online inference algorithm is proposed to bridge the differences between offline training and online inference. Using the proposed modeling method, we generate a highly accurate dynamics model of an autonomous driving vehicle. Our proposed model improves trajectory accuracy, in terms of mean average trajectory error, by 80.93% and 52.12% compared with the rule-based base model and learning-based base model respectively."

A time-varying reference is adopted, the assumption that the trajectory of the leader is linearly parameterized with some known functions is relaxed, and the control inputs are smooth. To design distributed control scheme for each vehicle, a local compensatory variable is generated based on information collected from its neighbors.

This paper takes the application of visual SLAM in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) positioning as background. Unlike atmospheric imaging, underwater medium has issues with low contrast and color distortion. Here an underwater image enhancement method is brought forward to settle this problem. In this method, the image was converted from red-green-blue (RGB) color space into hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space, and the irradiation image was achieved after the guided filer was conducted on value component. The reflection image was obtained according to Retinex theory, and the image was converted back to RGB space. Finally, a gamma correction was applied to strength the image contrast. In the experiment, the images were exploited to perform SLAM. The results indicated that the enhanced images perform better than the original images in feature points extraction and visual SLAM."
8996256,Analysis of Autonomous Vehicle Platoon with Disturbance Based on PLEXE,"The automation and coordination of vehicle has provided novel development opportunities for both the improvement of traffic efficiency and the efficiency and safety of vehicles within the platoon so that the research of related technology had becoming more and more popular. In this paper, we evaluate five traditional vehicle platoon auto-driving control algorithms in the sinusoidal scenario with disturbance. The simulation is realized in the PLEXE, which is an extension of the widespread vehicle network simulator Veins that allows the visually realistic simulation of platooning systems(i.e., automated car-following) and the analysis of mixed scenarios. For disturbance model in sinusoidal scenario, Gaussian noise is leveraged, which is a common disturbance of all kinds of system. Simulations' results indicate that, when the leader in the platoon driving with sinusoidal velocity with disturbance, Flatbed algorithm proposed by A. Ali, G. Garcia, and P. Martinet has higher stability and Anti-interference ability than the other four control algorithms. In addition, even under violent interference, this control law can maintain string stability (significant for platoon automation)and consistency of the platoon operations, such as consistent velocity and constant inter-vehicle gaps."
9088147,Joint Optimization of Delay-Tolerant Autonomous Electric Vehicles Charge Scheduling and Station Battery Degradation,"With the increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) and the development of emerging transportation network services, autonomous EVs (AEVs) may play an important role in the future of transportation. AEVs can automatically plan their route, park in the charging station, and support the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. However, V2G services may influence user dissatisfaction due to the task delays. There is a tradeoff between the optimization of electricity cost and user dissatisfaction. In this article, we formulate the problem to minimize the electricity cost of AEVs and the degradation cost of the charging station batteries with the constraint of V2G services and user dissatisfaction, which is a nonconvex problem and is difficult to solve. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, we design a suboptimal charging algorithm with some constraints (SCAC) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique to find a tradeoff between the total cost and user dissatisfaction. This algorithm cannot find the optimal solution but can give a selection criterion. Furthermore, in order to get a global charging schedule, we use the criterion from the SCAC algorithm as a priori knowledge to design the charging scheduling reinforcement-learning-based (CSRL) algorithm, which is more efficient than the reinforcement learning (RL) method without any particular criterion. We do simulations by using day-ahead price and practical profiles of AEVs to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The numerical results show that the CSRL algorithm has a better performance 5.12% than the SCAC algorithm and both algorithms are 12.66% and 17.14% better than the benchmark algorithm which is the shortest path (SP)-based algorithm. The CSRL algorithm has more efficiency ε(1 - Pr(Λ(t) = 0)) than the SCAC algorithm, where Pr(Λ(t) = 0) is a selection criterion calculated from the SCAC algorithm."
8868430,Vehicle Detection in the Aerial Infrared Images via an Improved Yolov3 Network,"Owing to the great adaptability to the weak light, the infrared camera equipped on the unmanned aerial vehicle is more and more adopted to capture the aerial images. Therefore, how to fully utilize the aerial infrared images for the vehicle detection has attracted widespread attentions. However, due to the low-resolution, low contrast, and few texture features of the infrared image, it is really difficult to implement the vehicle detection in the aerial infrared images. In our work, an efficient and accurate vehicle detection algorithm in aerial infrared images is proposed via an improved yolov3 network. To increase the detection efficiency, we construct a new structure of the improved yolov3 network with only 16 layers. Besides, we expand the anchor boxes to four scales to improve the detection accuracy of the small vehicles. Meanwhile, for the limitation of the infrared vehicle samples, the transfer learning is introduced to train the improved yolov3 network. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the VIVID and NPU data sets. Experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate that the proposed algorithm generates satisfactory and competitive vehicle detection results."

9294636,Scalable Autonomous Vehicle Safety Validation through Dynamic Programming and Scene Decomposition,"An open question in autonomous driving is how best to use simulation to validate the safety of autonomous vehicles. Existing techniques rely on simulated rollouts, which can be inefficient for finding rare failure events, while other techniques are designed to only discover a single failure. In this work, we present a new safety validation approach that attempts to estimate the distribution over failures of an autonomous policy using approximate dynamic programming. Knowledge of this distribution allows for the efficient discovery of many failure examples. To address the problem of scalability, we decompose complex driving scenarios into subproblems consisting of only the ego vehicle and one other vehicle. These subproblems can be solved with approximate dynamic programming and their solutions are recombined to approximate the solution to the full scenario. We apply our approach to a simple two-vehicle scenario to demonstrate the technique as well as a more complex five-vehicle scenario to demonstrate scalability. In both experiments, we observed an increase in the number of failures discovered compared to baseline approaches."

9551424,Dynamic Multi-Goal Motion Planning with Range Constraints for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Following Surface Vehicles,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are often required to reach multiple goal locations while staying within the communication range of a surface vehicle. The goals, which could be dispersed throughout the environment, are dynamically discovered by the surface vehicle as it moves along a predefined trajectory. As the goals are discovered, they are communicated to the AUV. This paper develops an efficient multi-layered planner that generates collision-free and dynamically-feasible trajectories that enable the AUV to reach as many goals as possible while always staying within the communication range of the surface vehicle. The planner relies on a roadmap to capture the connectivity of the environment in order to facilitate navigation. The high-level layer is based on discrete search to find paths over the roadmap that increase the sum of the rewards to the known goals while maintaining the range constraints. The low-level layer relies on sampling-based motion planning to expand a tree of feasible motions along paths computed by the discrete layer. These layers interact with each other to update the planned motions as new goals are dynamically discovered. Experiments using 3D environments, second-order AUV models, and an increasing number of goals, demonstrate the efficiency of the planner to solve dynamic multi-goal motion-planning problems with range constraints."
9310676,Algebraic General Trajectory Formula for Semitrailer Truck Vehicles,"Generating the drive path for autonomous vehicles represents a significant challenge and requires the vehicle trajectory to be accurately predicted. This study proposes an algebraic analytical method for deriving the general trajectory formula (GTF) of a semitrailer truck. The GTF provides the means to accurately predict the trajectory of any point on the semitrailer truck and is a function of seven parameters: four parameters relating to the semitrailer truck dimensions and three parameters relating to the truck turning conditions. The validity of the proposed GTF is demonstrated by means of an illustrative example. The results confirm that the GTF provides a simple, effective, and accurate method for performing the trajectory prediction of semitrailer truck motion. Note to Practitioners —The inspiration of this article comes from the problem of the semitrailer truck vehicles’ difference in the trajectories of the front and rear inner wheels as a vehicle turns, which is defined as the “difference of radius between inner wheels (DRIW).” It should be noted that, in order to determine the DRIW, the trajectory of the rear inner wheel (TRIW) must first be predicted, which is quite complicated. Existing predictions are mostly based on real vehicle testing or curve fitting. However, this study proposes an algebraic general trajectory formula (GTF) for semitrailer trucks based on seven parameters relating to the truck dimensions and truck turning conditions, respectively. The proposed GTF is computationally straightforward and is capable of predicting the trajectory of any point of the truck in real time under almost all realistic turning conditions. Preliminary motion simulation for the TRIW suggests that the GTF is correct, and this approach is feasible. However, the proposed method is only suitable for the truck with a single semitrailer. In future research, we will address the GTF of the truck with multiple semitrailers, and the results will be available for more type...

9560150,Longitudinal Control of Autonomous Vehicles Consisting of Power-train with Non-Linear Characteristics,"The autonomous vehicle studies recently have been accelerated to ensure more secure, efficient, and comfortable transportation. Non-linearity in the power-train makes longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles difficult at low speeds. Additionally, rapid acceleration and deceleration (due to the behavior of the surrounding vehicles) increase complexity in control of such systems. In this study, we designed a novel longitudinal controller including the reverse plant model of the vehicle to overcome these problems. The complete controller is designed using parameters known to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) with vehicle CAN bus signals. The longitudinal controller consists of two parts: The outer controller which determines the target speed according to lead vehicle's speed and the inner controller which determines the accelerator pedal percentage and brake requests. The inner controller includes PI followed by the reverse plant model with a virtual load sensor. This model enables control of a vehicle with non-linear power-train. The designed controller performance was tested on a city bus with a diesel engine and automatic transmission. Vehicle test results proved, that the designed controller is capable of controlling an autonomous vehicle with nonlinear power-train dynamics with onboard computational capacity even at low speeds."

8666962,An Adaptive Flare Scheme for Autonomous Landing of a Fixed-Wing UAV,"Despite significant improvements in autonomous flight control systems, the automatic landing of a UAV still possess significant technical challenges, especially during the flare mode, which is usually considered as a crucial part of landing. Flare starts right after the glide slope phase at about a few tenths of feet above ground and lasts till touchdown. Traditionally, in flare a predefined fixed profile of altitude descent is followed, which is usually an exponential function. However, a downside of this scheme is that the altitude at which flare is initiated is preset. This requires the UAV to reach this altitude at the end of the glide slope before flare is commenced. In case of any uncertainties or disturbances, if the UAV reaches the end of the glide slope phase at a slightly higher altitude, starting of flare mode is delayed, which may lead to go-around as the only viable option, especially on shorter runways. This paper presents an adaptive flare scheme to address the shortcomings of the traditional flare scheme. The proposed scheme is designed to be adaptive towards bounded variations in flight parameters such as velocity, altitude and flight path angle etc., at the beginning of the flare. Efficacy of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by the results based on simulations incorporating bounded variations in flight parameters."
8793838,Simulated Annealing-optimized Trajectory Planning within Non-Collision Nominal Intervals for Highway Autonomous Driving,"This article considers the problem of near-optimal trajectory generation for autonomous vehicles on highways. The goal is to select a predictive reference trajectory in the free evolution space, while avoiding both generating a pre-calculated set of candidate trajectories and decoupling path and velocity optimizations. Moreover, this trajectory aims at optimizing a decision process based on multi-criteria functions, which are not straightforward to design and can have a blackbox formulation. The main idea of this article is to use the decision evaluation function in the trajectory generator with a Simulated Annealing (SA) approach. The parameters of a sigmoid trajectory are optimized within Non-Collision Nominal Intervals (NCNI), which are defined as collision-free intervals under nominal conditions using a velocity-space representation."

This paper studies joint scheduling of computation and communication resources in the collaborative networking of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV s) and platooning vehicles in mobile edge computing (MEC) framework to maximize the energy efficiency. Considering the movement characteristics of vehicles, we integrate mobility, communication, computation, and energy consumption to establish a collective optimization problem. Since this multivariate coupled model is non-convex, we further propose a joint optimization method (JOM) algorithm based on the convex approximation theory, particularly quadratic programming. Experimental results verify that this algorithm converges quickly within a dozen iterations and proves to be superior to several other benchmark schemes."
8919385,A Solution for Building Motion Tracking System with Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicles,"With linearization solution for the model of wheels and vehicle according to model predictive control (MPC), in which vehicle models are linearized by a sets of steering angles with the assumption that these steering angles can help the vehicle to move to the last destination in a steady state with the model predictive control. In addition, the model's control input uses the force factor of the front wheel and the equivalent cornering wheel stiffness linearizes that of the rear wheel.

9663540,Universally Safe Swerve Maneuvers for Autonomous Driving,"This paper characterizes safe following distances for on-road driving when vehicles can avoid collisions by either braking or by swerving into an adjacent lane. In particular, we focus on safety as defined in the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) framework. We extend RSS by introducing swerve maneuvers as a valid response in addition to the already present brake maneuver. These swerve maneuvers use the more realistic kinematic bicycle model rather than the double integrator model of RSS. When vehicles are able to swerve or brake, it is shown that their required safe following distance at higher speeds is less than that required through braking alone. In addition, when all vehicles follow this new distance, they are provably safe. The use of the kinematic bicycle model is then validated by comparing these swerve maneuvers to that of a dynamic single-track model. The analysis in this paper can be used to inform both offline safety validation as well as safe control and planning."
9695349,An Innovative Interaction Approach in IMM Filtering for Vehicle Motion Models with Unequal States Dimension,"Robust and adaptive vehicle state estimation and tracking algorithms have become a very important part within the autonomous driving field. The family of interacting multiple model (IMM) filters has shown to provide very effective and accurate state estimation in systems whose behavior patterns change significantly over time. The main reason for the improved performance of IMM filters compared to single model approaches is the mode mixing, which constantly aligns the different models. This paper proposes an innovative way for the mode mixing, when the state-vectors of the models are of different size. The proposed mixing approach consists of two parts: firstly mixing the common states and secondly weighting between original and mixed states based on the model probabilities. Results from artificial simulations and real world measurement setups are shown to demonstrate the validity of the approach. Compared to previously suggested solutions, the proposed approach is more general and the overall complexity of the mode mixing step is reduced, which is the main contribution of the presented paper."
8712351,A Retargetable Fault Injection Framework for Safety Validation of Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles use Electronic Control Units running complex software to improve passenger comfort and safety. To test safety of in-vehicle electronics, the ISO 26262 standard on functional safety recommends using fault injection during component and system-level design. A Fault Injection Framework (FIF) induces hard-to-trigger hardware and software faults at runtime, enabling analysis of fault propagation effects. The growing number and complexity of diverse interacting components in vehicles demands a versatile FIF at the vehicle level. In this paper, we present a novel retargetable FIF based on debugger interfaces available on many target systems. We validated our FIF in three Hardware-In-the-Loop setups for autonomous driving based on the NXP BlueBox prototyping platform. To trigger a fault injection process, we developed an interactive user interface based on Robot Operating System, which also visualized vehicle system health. Our retargetable debugger-based fault injection mechanism confirmed safety properties and identified safety shortcomings of various automotive systems."
9304727,Integration of C-ITS in Autonomous Driving,"Cooperative, Connected and Autonomous (CCAD) is clearly the next step in the development of autonomous vehicles, solving much of the technological limitations that the autonomous vehicles suffer today. This development of the CCAD can be considered as an extension of Cooperative Systems (C-ITS) to the field of autonomous vehicles. However, the C-ITS were basically developed as means to provide warnings and recommendations to drivers, in order to improve their level of safety and efficiency based on the information provided by the V2X communications systems. Therefore, an adaptation is necessary, both cooperative systems and autonomous vehicles so that they can use the available awareness information. In this paper we present the results of the European project AUTOCITS, where a deployment of cooperative systems focused on Traffic Management Centers (TMC) has been carried out. The information provided by these TMCs is sent to the vehicles that circulate on the deployed roads through V2X, generating warnings on variable information panels in the case of unconnected vehicles, directly to drivers in the case of connected vehicles and to the vehicle itself in the case of autonomous and connected vehicles. Specifically, in this paper is presented the response of an autonomous vehicle to the speed reduction due to adverse weather conditions warnings generated from the TMC of the Spanish Traffic Agency (DGT)."
9032376,Tracking Control of an Articulated Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle in 6DOF Using Generalized Super-twisting: Theory and Experiments,"The articulated intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (AIAUV) is an underwater swimming manipulator with intervention capabilities. Station-keeping and trajectory tracking are essential for the AIAUV to be able to move in confined spaces and to perform intervention tasks. In this article, we propose using a generalized super-twisting algorithm (GSTA), which is an extension of the regular super-twisting algorithm, for the trajectory tracking of the position and orientation of the base of the AIAUV in six degrees of freedom (6DOF). We also propose using a higher-order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) for estimating the linear and angular velocities when velocity measurements are unavailable. Furthermore, we show the ultimate boundedness of the tracking errors for a control law using the GSTA and for a control law that combines the GSTA with an HOSMO. We also prove that the GSTA gives global uniform finite-time stability. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed control laws with comprehensive simulation and experimental results."

9672160,Spatio-Temporal Scene-Graph Embedding for Autonomous Vehicle Collision Prediction,"In autonomous vehicles (AVs), early warning systems rely on collision prediction to ensure occupant safety. However, state-of-the-art methods using deep convolutional networks either fail at modeling collisions or are too expensive/slow, making them less suitable for deployment on AV edge hardware. To address these limitations, we propose SG2VEC, a spatio-temporal scene-graph embedding methodology that uses Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict future collisions via visual scene perception. We demonstrate that SG2VEC predicts collisions 8.11% more accurately and 39.07% earlier than the state-of-the-art method on synthesized datasets, and 29.47% more accurately on a challenging realworld collision dataset. We also show that SG2VEC is better than the state-of-the-art at transferring knowledge from synthetic datasets to real-world driving datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that SG2VEC performs inference 9.3x faster with an 88.0% smaller model, 32.4% less power, and 92.8% less energy than the state-of-the-art method on the industry-standard Nvidia DRIVE PX 2 platform, making it more suitable for implementation on the edge."

9658225,Horizon-wise Model Predictive Control with Application to Autonomous Driving Vehicle,"In the paper, we present an innovative approach, horizon-wise model predictive control (H-MPC), to solve the model predictive control (MPC) problem of a linear time-varying (LTV) system. In H-MPC, we regard the time-varying parameters as time-invariant within the prediction horizon. To solve the MPC problem of the time-varying system, the decision variable is decomposed into two terms: one for linear time-invariant (LTI) optimization and the other for compensating LTV uncertainties with an introduction to a uniform compensation condition. The proposed H-MPC solves the time-varying problem by removing the uncertainty due to the future parameter variations within the horizon and by updating the time-invariant MPC each sampling time. To validate the usefulness of the proposed H-MPC, it is applied to lane tracking control for an autonomous driving vehicle. From a comparative study, it was confirmed that the proposed H-MPC has a competitive performance compared to LTV-MPC despite its much simpler structure."

9564458,Proactive Longitudinal Control of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles with Lane-Change Assistance for Human-Driven Vehicles,"Vehicle automation and connectivity enable the cooperative platooning control of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which can enhance traffic safety and alleviate traffic oscillations. However, CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will coexist on roads prior to the pure CAV environment, creating a mixed-flow traffic environment. Mixed-flow traffic introduces challenges for CAV operations in terms of lane-change maneuvers of HDVs in adjacent lanes, which can generate oscillations, jeopardizing the performance of platooning control. Hence, there is a need to explore the interactions between the CAV and the HDV in the lane-change process, and analyze how CAVs can proactively respond to HDV lane change to dampen the generated disturbances. This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based proactive longitudinal control strategy for the CAV to assist the HDV lane change, and minimize the adverse impact on the smooth operation of the mixed platoon. Results from numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Further, the generalizability of the proposed control strategy for different HDV driver types is demonstrated."

Specifically, roads without current infrastructure constraints of traffic lights, stop signals at intersections or vehicle lanes. This study investigates controller automation for vehicles that must navigate and coordinate with each other on such autonomous vehicle only roads. We comparatively evaluate fitness-function (objective) versus behavior-based (novelty search) versus hybridized objective-novelty evolutionary search for synthesizing autonomous vehicle coordinated driving behavior. The goal of such evolved coordinated driving behavior is to maximize effective (safe) and efficient (expedient) autonomous vehicle traffic throughput for given roads. Results indicate that while novelty and hybrid search evolved effective and efficient driving behaviors, these behaviors did not generalize to new roads as well as driving behaviors evolved with objective-based search."
9304791,Connected and Autonomous Vehicles cooperate with the pedestrian in industrial sites based on trajectory optimization and vehicle signalization system,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) is the development trend in the field of transportation systems. Recent studies show that the resources sharing between pedestrians and CAV is a big challenge. Considering traffic safety and efficiency at that sharing point not only requires a collision avoidance system but also more communicative behaviors of the CAV. More precisely, pedestrian needs to understand the intention of the incoming CAV whether it will cross first or not according to its speed profile. This paper uses the optimal trajectory control to provide CAV with a communicative behavior. A scenario where CAV and pedestrian cooperate together to cross a conflict zone is studied. A communicative CAV behavior is designed through an objective function. Hamiltonian analysis is used to derive the optimal control for the CAV. Based on Oculus virtual reality platform, the proposed approach is tested and the behavior of cars and pedestrians are studied. The tests show that this approach provides CAVs with a kind of automatic courtesy."

Departing from traditional complex systems, it promises to address the steering, throttle, and braking predictions with a single neural network. However, it requires significant amounts of diverse training data, high-end cameras and expensive computation units. In this paper we describe an end-to-end learning platform for autonomous driving, built with emphasis on minimizing requirements, both in terms of software and hardware. We accomplish autonomous navigation on a closed track with a single low-cost camera and a typical laptop. We describe each step, from data pre-processing to actuation, evaluate trade-offs, and motivate decisions. Our analysis concludes that standard performance metrics are incomplete; thus we expand our analysis to heuristic behavioral evaluation by visualizing the backpropagation process, broadening our understanding of the deep neural network."
9380511,Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Mining Trucks Considering Terrain Constraints,"There are many constraints to be considered to plan a safe and feasible trajectory for autonomous mining trucks due to the rough terrain in open-pit mines. It is difficult to handle these constraints uniformly within a trajectory planning framework. To overcome this limitation, a novel trajectory planning framework is proposed in this paper. Different from many existing studies which characterized the spatial positions of vehicles at the sampling time points as decision variables, we characterize the time points at the sampling spatial positions as decision variables to conveniently address the terrain constraints. Based on such a formulation, we further consider the kinematic constraints, engine power constraints and time window constraints. Various objectives (e.g., transport efficiency, fuel economy) can be considered in this trajectory planning framework, and the formulated trajectory planning problems can be efficiently solved. Finally, several case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework."
8999633,RACE: Reinforced Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Collision Avoidance,"With the rapid development of autonomous driving, collision avoidance has attracted attention from both academia and industry. Many collision avoidance strategies have emerged in recent years, but the dynamic and complex nature of driving environment poses a challenge to develop robust collision avoidance algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a decentralized framework named RACE: Reinforced Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Collision AvoidancE. Leveraging a hierarchical architecture we develop an algorithm named Co-DDPG to efficiently train autonomous vehicles. Through a security abiding channel, the autonomous vehicles distribute their driving policies. We use the relative distances obtained by the opponent sensors to build the VANET instead of locations, which ensures the vehicle's location privacy. With a leader-follower architecture and parameter distribution, RACE accelerates the learning of optimal policies and efficiently utilizes the remaining resources. We implement the RACE framework in the widely used TORCS simulator and conduct various experiments to measure the performance of RACE. Evaluations show that RACE quickly learns optimal driving policies and effectively avoids collisions. Moreover, RACE also scales smoothly with varying number of participating vehicles. We further compared RACE with existing autonomous driving systems and show that RACE outperforms them by experiencing 65% less collisions in the training process and exhibits improved performance under varying vehicle density."

A management system is created to get the status from the AVs and separate the monitoring requirement to the observers optimally. When the requirements might be intensive, the management system can also adjust the movements of the AVs actively to distribute the monitoring time, which can make the observers monitor more vehicles. We implement and verify the management system in an autonomous driving simulator - CARLA for the limited number of AVs and observers. Based on the data acquired from the driving simulator, we also create a numerical simulator and tested our method with the pairs of a large number of AVs and observers. The result of both simulators shows that our method can reduce the utilization degree of observers and make them monitor more AVs."

Autonomous vehicles depend on sensors for measuring conditions of roads and for making decisions while driving, and safety depends on the consistency of these sensors. Autonomous vehicles are robotic systems that are not only capable of regulating their motion in response to the sensory data they have obtained, but are also capable of behaving intelligently (or flexibly) in their environment.

Their structural limits of all degrees of freedom are considered. The method is suggested that does not allow unpredictable reaching any degree of freedom the limit and going of its tool out of the boundaries of the working area. This is done by giving the manipulator an additional (redundant) degree of freedom by moving the autonomous underwater vehicle along the object of work. The trajectories of the manipulator can be defined in advance or be generated directly in the process of operations. The developed method allows automatically keeping the smooth movements of tools by the exception of undesirable (unexpected) reverses of actuators without emergencies and reducing quality of the works.

In the guidance loop, a kinematic control law of the desired surge speed and pitch rate is derived based on a backstepping technique and a line-of-sight guidance principle. In the control loop, an extended state observer is developed to estimate the extended state composed of unknown internal dynamics and external disturbances. Then, a disturbance rejection control law is constructed using the extended state observer. To bridge the guidance loop and the control loop, a reference governor is proposed for computing optimal guidance signals within the velocity and input constraints.

8772139,Trajectory Planning and Safety Assessment of Autonomous Vehicles Based on Motion Prediction and Model Predictive Control,"Security problem is a fundamental issue for autonomous vehicles. Trajectory planning is a significant component of autonomous vehicle system, which directly influences the automated traffic safety. In this paper, the motion prediction of other traffic participants is considered. We use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probabilistic occupancy of the object and give a map from probability statistics to actual scenarios. The non-time-based reference trajectory can be obtained by using high-definition map and lane detection. Then model predictive control is utilized to optimize the reference trajectory according to the current state of autonomous vehicle. Different prediction horizons and coordinate transformation are adopted to optimize the planning. By doing so, the constraint conditions can be easily involved and the result is more intuitive. The probabilistic occupancy of other traffic participants are computed offline and then the obtained results are used in real-time application. Therefore, the real-time computational burden is reduced. The crash probability is put forward to verify the feasibility of real-time trajectory in safety assessment module. Two typical scenarios are analyzed: lane change on the straight road and turning at the intersection. The simulation results illustrate the efficiency of our method."

9342809,Real-Time Geometric Representation of Lane-Change Decision for Autonomous Vehicles Using Dynamic Optimization Algorithm,"This paper develops a lane-change geometric representation that can be used in an on-road vehicle. The design of the proposed system uses the data collected from active a host vehicle and measures the relative speed between host vehicle and obstacle vehicles in real-time. The available distance to the target lanes measures the separated distance between the host and obstacle vehicles in real-time. These data are generated automatically using a dynamic environment and updated using time and object dynamics laws. The main algorithm uses the data to test the availability of using lane-change while checking if there is a slight break applied not to waste the testing time of the testing, then the smart searching algorithm applies to find the most suitable solution to change the lane safely as fast as possible. The desired system has been achieved with accepted real-time results that exceed the standard driver response time. Also, full accepted safety results allow the vehicle to get out of the lane with particular speed and steering angles to avoid collisions and avoid crashes in the host vehicle."
9645802,Powering Prediction of an Autonomous Campus Shuttle using CFD,"Universities and colleges worldwide are being equipped with campus shuttles due to their large campus size. These generally are 6-to-8-seater vehicles to transport students around the campus. Academic spaces around the world are built as safe places for the academia of the institution.

The onboard sensors are used to segment the road region and register the topometric map in order to fuse the high-level navigation goals with a variational path planner in the vehicle frame. This enables the system to plan trajectories that correctly navigate road intersections without the use of an external localization system such as GPS or a detailed prior map. Since the topometric maps already exist for the vast majority of roads, this solution greatly increases the geographical scope for autonomous mobility solutions. We implement MapLite on a full-scale autonomous vehicle and exhaustively test it on over 15 km of road including over 100 autonomous intersection traversals. We further extend these results through simulated testing to validate the system on complex road junction topologies such as traffic circles."

To reduce the computational consumption, particles only keep the current estimated position of the vehicle, while all historical states of the vehicle are stored in the mean trajectory map. Using this set-up, only the weights of the particles which closed to the mean trajectory map are calculated with newly collected bathymetric data. A hierarchical clustering procedure is also discussed to identify invalid loop closures. The performance of the proposed method is validated using both the simulated data and the field data collected from sea trails.

8794007,Hierarchical Game-Theoretic Planning for Autonomous Vehicles,"The actions of an autonomous vehicle on the road affect and are affected by those of other drivers, whether overtaking, negotiating a merge, or avoiding an accident. This mutual dependence, best captured by dynamic game theory, creates a strong coupling between the vehicle's planning and its predictions of other drivers' behavior, and constitutes an open problem with direct implications on the safety and viability of autonomous driving technology. Unfortunately, dynamic games are too computationally demanding to meet the real-time constraints of autonomous driving in its continuous state and action space. In this paper, we introduce a novel game-theoretic trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous driving, that enables real-time performance by hierarchically decomposing the underlying dynamic game into a long-horizon “strategic” game with simplified dynamics and full information structure, and a short-horizon “tactical” game with full dynamics and a simplified information structure. The value of the strategic game is used to guide the tactical planning, implicitly extending the planning horizon, pushing the local trajectory optimization closer to global solutions, and, most importantly, quantitatively accounting for the autonomous vehicle and the human driver's ability and incentives to influence each other. In addition, our approach admits non-deterministic models of human decision-making, rather than relying on perfectly rational predictions. Our results showcase richer, safer, and more effective autonomous behavior in comparison to existing techniques."
9298205,Steering Control for Autonomous Vehicle using Model Predictive Controller,"In this paper, an effective solution for the steering control system which is indeed an important part to build the autonomous vehicle is presented. A Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is designed to control the steering angle. Vehicle is controlled by varied counting of the steering angles according to the obstacle's position in the lane. The system has obstacle swerving abilities which is supplemented by a LIDAR detector. The proposed setup analyses the space surrounding the vehicle's lane and tracks moving obstacles. The foremost maneuver is to initiate the motive force to quickly move the vehicle to an adjacent lane, drive past the obstacle and move to the initial lane. Other feature incorporated is the Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system used to detect when the vehicle deviates from the lane and accordingly adjusts the steering angle mechanically. This performance of the controller is evaluated using MATLAB simulations and is implemented on vehicle prototype."
9419535,Effect of Size of Preceding Vehicle on Behavior of Following Vehicle,"In this study, we demonstrated that the size of a preceding vehicle affects the behavior of the following driver. Intelligent assistance systems, including autonomous driving, have been considered in the prevention of traffic accidents. If forecasting future actions of surrounding vehicles is possible, driving safety can be significantly improved. Therefore, our research group developed a prediction system. Previous studies reported on the effect of the size of the preceding vehicle on the driving behaviors of the following vehicle. However, the effect on the lane changes of the following vehicle has not yet been discussed. This paper analyzes the effect of the size of the preceding vehicle, particularly focusing on lane changes. It is demonstrated that drivers frequently change lanes when a large vehicle is ahead compared with when a normal-sized vehicle is ahead. In addition, the model of lane-change detection considering the size of the preceding vehicle was constructed using actual traffic data. Based on a comparison with a conventional model, our approach proved to be capable of improving early detection performance."

On-road free space and vehicle dynamics are detected for learning features to generate suitable trajectories. The trajectory generation is further integrated with a state-space decision making system. Our proposed method is validated on a real autonomous vehicle in the presence of illegal on-street parking with an on-road test. Result shows that the planning framework gives a safe trajectory to avoid objects for considered illegal on-street parking with a guarantee that a collision will not occur."
9368284,Verification of Autonomous Vehicles: Scenario Generation based on Real World Accidents,"With the advent of technologies that allow for selfdriving and autonomous vehicles, it is of the utmost importance to ensure the safety of occupants, pedestrians, and other motorists. Investigating when, why, and how these vehicles fail is integral to preventing future recurrences of these kinds of incidents. By gathering these accidents, their associated data, and simulating them, it is possible to identify the major reasons for the accident as well as allowing for the testing and verification of autonomous vehicles (AVs), before they encounter the real world. This knowledge can then be further refined for the purposes of establishing a set of standards for AV safety and capabilities. This paper proposes a novel system for crash scenario generation which works based on actual AV crashes. In addition, there does not yet exist a cloud based database for housing AV crashes, locations, and descriptions. Furthermore, there also does not exist an automated system that creates simulated testing scenarios based on real AV crashes. Our proposed algorithm checks the AV crash location and designs virtual roads from map data about the crash location, retrieved from Open Street Maps. Then it is planned to use natural language processing (NLP) to generate the crash scenario based on the crash description. The virtual scenario, which includes real features of roads - such as curvature, number of lanes, and speed limits - will be used to test AVs. Another portion of the proposed system will allow for important features to be extracted automatically from these crashes, which will be used for improving the road designs capable of addressing AV's needs."
9570132,Path Tracking Control for Underactuated Vehicles With Matched-Mismatched Uncertainties: An Uncertainty Decomposition Based Constraint-Following Approach,"This paper presents a robust path tracking control method by utilizing the ideology of constraint-following approach for uncertain underactuated autonomous vehicles. The uncertainties are bounded with an unknown boundary. They do not all fall within the range space of the input matrix. Based on kinematic relations between the desired path and vehicle, the path tracking task is transformed into an equality constraint of the vehicle lateral dynamics states. The control goal is to make the underactuated vehicle follow the constraint, thus realizing the desired tracking performance. The constraint-following robust control (CFRC) is designed in two steps. First, a servo control design for the nominal system is devised without considering uncertainty and initial constraint deviation. Second, the uncertainty is meticulously decomposed into matched and mismatched portions based on the geometric structural characteristics of the constraint dynamics system. As a result, since the mismatched uncertainty is orthogonal to the constraint-following geometric space, it ``disappears'' in the stability analysis. The matched uncertainty is estimated by a self-adjusting leakage type adaptive law. On this basis, a robust control is designed based on the estimated matched uncertainty. Through Lyapunov minimax analysis, the proposed control method guarantees the approximate constraint-following performance. Finally, the TruckSim-Simulink co-simulations and real vehicle experiments are presented. The results show that the proposed control can robustly realize excellent tracking performance in the presence of time-vary uncertainties."
8867088,Autonomous Mobile Acoustic Monitoring System Simulation and Implementation,"Due to the potential of the offshore wind energy in the Taiwan Strait, the development of the offshore wind farm is cost-effective. However, the expected develop area for potential offshore wind farms has overlapped with the habitat of the Sousa chinensis (also called Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin or Chinese White Dolphin). Therefore, to know if there are dolphins in the construction area is the most important. This paper provides a process for checking if there are dolphins in the specific area and using an unmanned surface vehicle to track the source and find the area they are. This process has four main topics, including real-time dolphin whistle detection, underwater acoustic source direction calculate, source tracking behavior (STB) and real-time shoreside monitoring system of the surface vehicle. The whole system was developed using the open source middleware MOOS-IvP and testing in the embedded system (NVIDIA Jetson TX1). The whole system was implemented and successfully tested in the field experiment using artificial dolphin sound."
9428596,Lane-Change Intention Inference Based on RNN for Autonomous Driving on Highways,"Recently, inferring lane change intention has received considerable attention. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic contexts, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of long-term prediction tasks and lack the ability of capturing nonlinear temporal dependencies. This paper proposes an intention inference model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to tackle time series prediction problems. Considering dynamic interaction among surrounding vehicles, our model takes the sequence motion information of surrounding vehicles as inputs and calculates the congestion of different lanes, integrated with vehicle states of the object vehicle. To illustrate the availability of the proposed RNN intention inference model, a motion planning controller considering intention was developed. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) was established to planning a safe, sub-optimal path for autonomous driving vehicle under collision avoidance constraints. The experiments on the proposed model were conducted, based on two RNN structure Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Generalized Recurrent Unit (GRU), by Tensorflow with NGSIM data. The motion planning controller is modeled and simulated by Carsim with Simulink for some typical scenarios. Subsequently, experimental results demonstrate that RNN achieves best performance, inferring intention with 96% accuracy, compared with other approaches."
8533357,Building an Autonomous Lane Keeping Simulator Using Real-World Data and End-to-End Learning,"Autonomous lane keeping is an important safety feature for intelligent vehicles. This paper presents a lane keeping simulator that is built with image projections of recorded data in conjunction with vehicle dynamics estimation. An end-to-end learning method using convolutional neural network (CNN) takes front-view camera data as input and produces the proper steering wheel angle to keep the vehicle in lane. A novel method of data augmentation is proposed using vehicle dynamic model and vehicle trajectory tracking, which can create additional training data as if a vehicle drives off-lane in any displacement and orientation. Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN model trained with the simulator can achieve higher accuracy for autonomous lane keeping and much lower failure rate. The simulator can serve as a platform for both training and evaluation of vision based autonomous driving algorithms. The experimental dataset is made available at <;uri>http://computing.wpi.edu/dataset.html<;/uri>."

Manually controlling MAVs in such scenarios requires experienced pilots and is error-prone, especially in stressful situations of real emergencies. The conditions of disaster scenarios are also challenging for autonomous MAV systems. The environment is usually not known in advance and GNSS might not always be available. We present a system for autonomous MAV flights in unknown environments which does not rely on global positioning systems. The method is evaluated in multiple search and rescue scenarios and allows for safe autonomous flights, even when transitioning between indoor and outdoor areas."
9649838,Path Tracking Control for Four-Wheel-Steering Autonomous Vehicles based on Adaptive Sliding Mode Control with Control Allocation,"This paper presents a path tracking control algorithm for four-wheel steering autonomous vehicles. The proposed controller utilized the direct yaw moment control approach for path tracking of the autonomous vehicle. The path tracking algorithm consists of three parts, desired yaw-rate decision, adaptive sliding mode control, and control allocation. The desired yaw rate has been determined based on the geometric relationship between a reference path and vehicle position. A required yaw-moment to tracking the desired yaw-rate has been decided by using an adaptive sliding mode control approach to compensate for the linear tire model assumption. Since the four-wheel steering vehicle is an overactuated system, the optimization-based control allocation has been introduced to determine the front and rear-wheel steering inputs, respectively, considering a control effort, actuator limit, ride comfort, and body slip. The simulation study has been conducted to compare the path tracking performance of the base controller using front steering and the proposed algorithm. It has been shown from the simulations that the path tracking performance has been improved in a driving situation with a high curvature and a steep road slope."
8962167,Characterizing User Responses to Failures in Aerial Autonomous Systems,"Users are often the last barrier in the detection and correction of abnormal behavior in autonomous systems, so understanding what can be expected from users in various contexts is crucial to the performance of such systems. This letter presents the first study characterizing a user ability to timely report and correct autonomous system failures in the context of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAVs). The study aims to explore the complex tradespace which designers will encounter when developing effective transitions of control in sUAVs. We have analyzed these tradeoffs in terms of accuracy and response time while manipulating several key contextual elements including subtlety of failure, transitions of control, introduction of noise in autonomous paths, and amount of user training. Results indicate that: 1) increased accuracy is achieved under longer deadlines without large delays in responses, 2) increased noise, user training, and user responsibility for correction lead to increased reporting times, but only increased user responsibility increased accuracy, 3) users, particularly those with additional training, wanted to remain engaged in failure correction even when such interactions were not requested, 4) asking users to fix failures that they did not report resulted in increased response times and reduced accuracy."
8734788,Computational Fluid Dynamics Prediction of the Dynamic Behavior of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Prediction of the dynamic behavior of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is the basis for developing the control system and optimizing the hydrodynamic shape of AUVs. A fast and efficient prediction method of dynamic behavior of AUVs was developed with the secondary programming of a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code of FLUENT. In the proposed CFD method, mass properties of the AUV and thrust of the propeller were coupled to the 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic equations of AUV in the form of user defined functions. A subregional unstructured mixed meshing strategy combining static meshes and dynamic meshes was proposed to improve the computational efficiency and to realize the 6-DOF movement of AUV. The proposed CFD prediction method can predict not only the dynamic behavior of the AUV, but also its surrounding flow field. Dynamic behavior of a seafloor mapping AUV in straight running and turn running were predicted using the developed CFD strategy. Comparison between the prediction results from the CFD method and those from the sea trials proved the proposed method to be accurate and effective. Some measures were put forward to improve motion performance of the vehicle according to the prediction results."
9304767,A Geometric Approach to On-road Motion Planning for Long and Multi-Body Heavy-Duty Vehicles,"Driving heavy-duty vehicles, such as buses and tractor-trailer vehicles, is a difficult task in comparison to passenger cars. Most research on motion planning for autonomous vehicles has focused on passenger vehicles, and many unique challenges associated with heavy-duty vehicles remain open. However, recent works have started to tackle the particular difficulties related to on-road motion planning for buses and tractor-trailer vehicles using numerical optimization approaches. In this work, we propose a framework to design an optimization objective to be used in motion planners. Based on geometric derivations, the method finds the optimal trade-off between the conflicting objectives of centering different axles of the vehicle in the lane. For the buses, we consider the front and rear axles trade-off, whereas for articulated vehicles, we consider the tractor and trailer rear axles trade-off. Our results show that the proposed design strategy produces planned paths that considerably improve the behavior of heavy-duty vehicles by keeping the whole vehicle body in the center of the lane."
8734737,Towards Next-Generation Vehicles Featuring the Vehicle Intelligence,"Safe driving and minimizing the number of casualties are the main motivations of researchers and car companies for decades. They also care very much on saving fuel consumption and high comfort-level trips. With the help of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) applications, safer, more comfortable, and greener trips are very likely at the present time. However, today humankind is very close to make a very old dream, namely, driverless vehicles, to come true. In this paper, we address the concept of next-generation vehicles, their requirements, challenges, advantages, and problems. Regarding Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), levels (1-5), we first define the crucial contexts for next-generation vehicles. We then discuss existing ADAS, their abilities, and available platforms which they run on from past to present. Next, we introduce a novel vehicle intelligence (VI) architecture consisting of ADAS modules and VI services which would pave the way for fully autonomous vehicles regarding not only driving issue, but also human-centric new demands such as entertainment and comfort level of the journey. The proposed conceptual design is built on sensors, vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs), and big data. Afterward, we describe how current ADAS applications would transform on the way toward SAE Level 5 cars. We finally discuss the open issues for next-generation vehicles."
9681339,Safety-Critical Control With Nonaffine Control Inputs Via a Relaxed Control Barrier Function for an Autonomous Vehicle,"When designing a controller for the autonomous vehicle system, safety and trajectory tracking performance are two major concerns. This letter proposes a novel control design for an autonomous vehicle system with nonaffine control inputs that can track the desired trajectories while considering the safety constraint. First, the vehicle dynamics is modeled using the differential flatness approach. The dynamic inversion method is then employed for the trajectory tracking of a nonaffine-in control system, and a control barrier function (CBF) approach is utilized to enforce the safety constraint. The trajectory tracking control is handled as a least-squares optimization problem, while the CBF is considered as a constraint. By relaxing the CBF constraint to the cost function, the novel control design is derived via a dynamic inversion. The safety and the stability of the closed-loop system are analyzed using a singular perturbation method. The proposed method is validated using numerical simulation and the high-fidelity car simulator under realistic driving scenarios."
9678841,Metamorphic Testing on Multi-module UAV Systems,"Recent years have seen a rapid development of machine learning based multi-module unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. To address the oracle problem in autonomous systems, numerous studies have been conducted to use metamorphic testing to automatically generate test scenes for various modules, e.g., those in self-driving cars. However, as most of the studies are based on unit testing including end-to-end model-based testing, a similar testing approach may not be equally effective for UAV systems where multiple modules are working closely together. Therefore, in this paper, instead of unit testing, we propose a novel metamorphic system testing framework for UAV, named MSTU, to detect the defects in multi-module UAV systems. A preliminary evaluation plan to apply MSTU on an emerging autonomous multi-module UAV system is also presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed testing framework."
9145864,A Vehicle Simulation Model and Automated Driving Features Validation for Low-Speed High Automation Applications,"The low-speed high automation (LSHA) is foreseen as a development path for new types of mobility, improving road safety and addressing transit problems in urban infrastructures. As these automation approaches are still in the development phase, methods to improve their design and validation are required. The use of vehicle simulation models allows reducing significantly the time deployment on real test tracks, which would not consider all the scenarios or complexity related to automated driving features. However, to ensure safety and accuracy while evaluating the proper operation of LSHA features, adequate validation methodologies are mandatory. In this study a two-step validation methodology is proposed: Firstly, an open-loop test set attempts to tune the required vehicle simulation models using experimental data considering also the dynamics of the actuation devices required for vehicle automation. Secondly, a closed-loop test strives to validate the selected automated driving functionality based on test plans, also improving the vehicle dynamics response. To illustrate the methodology, a study case is proposed using an automated Renault Twizy. In the first step, the brake pedal and steering wheel actuators’ behavior is modeled, as well as its longitudinal dynamics and turning capacity. Then, in a second step, an LSHA functionality for Traffic Jam Assist based on a Model Predictive Control approach is evaluated and validated. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is capable not only to tune vehicle simulation models for automated driving development purposes but also to validate LSHA functionalities."
9564102,An Empirical Testing of Autonomous Vehicle Simulator System for Urban Driving,"Safety is one of the main challenges that prohibit autonomous vehicles (AV), requiring them to be well tested ahead of being allowed on the road. In comparison with road tests, simulators allow us to validate the AV conveniently and affordably. However, it remains unclear how to best use the AV-based simulator system for testing effectively. Our paper presents an empirical testing of AV simulator system that combines the SVL simulator and the Apollo platform. We propose 576 test cases which are inspired by four naturalistic driving situations with pedestrians and surrounding cars. We found that the SVL can imitate realistic safe and collision situations; and at the same time, Apollo can drive the car quite safely. On the other hand, we noted that the system failed to detect pedestrians or vehicles on the road in three out of four classes, accounting for 10.0% total number of scenarios tested. We further applied metamorphic testing to identify inconsistencies in the system with additional 486 test cases. We then discussed some insights into the scenarios that may cause hazardous situations in real life. In summary, this paper provides a new empirical evidence to strengthen the assertion that the simulator-based system can be an indispensable tool for a comprehensive testing of the AV."

9341132,Output-Only Fault Detection and Mitigation of Networks of Autonomous Vehicles,"An autonomous vehicle platoon is a network of autonomous vehicles that communicate together to move in a desired way. One of the greatest threats to the operation of an autonomous vehicle platoon is the failure of either a physical component of a vehicle or a communication link between two vehicles. This failure affects the safety and stability of the autonomous vehicle platoon. Transmissibility-based health monitoring uses available sensor measurements for fault detection under unknown excitation and unknown dynamics of the network. After a fault is detected, a sliding mode controller is used to mitigate the fault. Different fault scenarios are considered including vehicle internal disturbances, cyber attacks, and communication delays. We apply the proposed approach to a bond graph model of the platoon and an experimental setup consisting of three autonomous robots."
9612691,Experimental Dynamics Identification of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle and Modified Model Reference Adaptive Controller Design,"This paper investigates experimental diving dynamic model identification of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). An effective identification method based on tracking differentiator and augmented recursive least square (TD-ARLS) estimator is introduced to identify unknown model parameters. Depending on the identified model, a modified Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) law is proposed to obtain optimal control performance. The identified model is adopted as the reference model to design the modified MRAC for the AUV’s diving dynamics. The lake trials of Explorer 1000 AUV and simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
9304641,Optimization-based incentivization and control scheme for autonomous traffic,"We consider the problem of incentivization and optimal control of autonomous vehicles for improving traffic congestion. In our scenario, autonomous vehicles must be incentivized in order to participate in traffic improvement. Using the theory and methods of optimal transport, we propose a constrained optimization framework over dynamics governed by partial differential equations, so that we can optimally select a portion of vehicles to be incentivized and controlled. The goal of the optimization is to obtain a uniform distribution of vehicles over the spatial domain. To achieve this, we consider two types of penalties on vehicle density, one is the
L
2
cost and the other is a multiscale-norm cost, commonly used in fluid-mixing problems. To solve this nonconvex optimization problem, we introduce a novel algorithm, which iterates between solving a convex optimization problem and propagating the flow of uncontrolled vehicles according to the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. We perform numerical simulations, which suggest that the optimization of the
L
2
cost is ineffective while optimization of the multiscale norm is effective. The results also suggest the use of a dedicated lane for this type of control in practice."
8917387,End-to-end Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Longitudinal Control Using Advantage Actor Critic with Temporal Context,"Reinforcement learning has been used widely for autonomous longitudinal control algorithms. However, many existing algorithms suffer from sample inefficiency in reinforcement learning as well as the jerky driving behaviour of the learned systems. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm and a training framework to address these two disadvantages of previous algorithms proposed in this field. The proposed system uses an Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) learning system with recurrent layers to introduce temporal context within the network. This allows the learned system to evaluate continuous control actions based on previous states and actions in addition to current states. Moreover, slow training of the algorithm caused by its sample inefficiency is addressed by utilising another neural network to approximate the vehicle dynamics. Using a neural network as a proxy for the simulator has significant benefit to training as it reduces the requirement for reinforcement learning to query the simulation (which is a major bottleneck) in learning and as both reinforcement learning network and proxy network can be deployed on the same GPU, learning speed is considerably improved. Simulation results from testing in IPG CarMaker show the effectiveness of our recurrent A2C algorithm, compared to an A2C without recurrent layers."

9221222,Autonomous Vehicles: Building a Test-bed Prototype at a Controlled Environment,"Rapid improvements in technology are making autonomous vehicles feasible. Researchers and industry are looking for different methods to implement the concept of smart cities. Autonomous Vehicles provide a unifying framework for several research topics (e.g., navigation, localization and Global Positioning System (GPS) positioning, security, and privacy). Despite significant progress, we believe that fully autonomous vehicles will be deployed initially in constrained environments (e.g., closed-loop areas, gated retirement communities).In this paper, we describe the development of a prototype autonomous golf-cart that can be used as a test-bed for a range of research projects. We explain the details of the conversion from a traditional golf-cart to an autonomously driven one. Our target application is a system of autonomously driven golf-carts for use within a retirement community. We show our testing results, and how Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be used to extend the WiFi coverage for log reporting and to request the golf-cart. Finally, we discuss the challenges and highlight improvements that can be performed on the system."
8905169,Detecting Water Reflection Symmetries in Point Clouds for Camera Position Calibration in Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"The development of autonomous vehicles has seen considerable advances over the past decade. However, specific challenges remain in the area of autonomous waterborne navigation. Two key aspects in autonomous surface vehicles are sensor calibration and segmentation of water surface. Cameras and other sensors in a car or drone can be installed accurately in a specific position and orientation. In a large vessel, this is not always possible, as sensors might be installed around the vessel or on masts. Taking advantage of the medium in which these vehicles operate, the water plane can be used as a reference for different sensors to calibrate their orientation. This allows more accurate localization of obstacles of objects. State-of-the-art deep learning techniques have been successfully applied for water surface segmentation in open sea. However, in other environments such as small rivers or lakes with still waters, a different approach might enable more accurate water surface estimation. We propose a method to estimate the water plane based on the detection of local symmetry planes that naturally occur when objects are reflected in the water. By using a point cloud generated with a stereo camera, we are able to accurately estimate the water level and, at the same time, calibrate the camera position and improve the localization of obstacles. We assume that an approximate position and orientation of the camera is known with respect to the sea level. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method with data obtained in the Aura river, Finland, with our prototype vessel facing both the riverside and the center of the river."
9118374,A comparative study of Lane Change Assistance Protocols at Road Network,"Driving over road networks is an everyday challenge that several research studies have been proposed to make it more safe and convenient. One of the main issues need to be efficiently and accurately handled is lane change scenarios. Drivers need to change their driving lane to take an exit on a road or to open the way for faster or emergency vehicle on that lane. Changing lane over highway road scenarios is a more serious challenge than changing it on downtown areas. This is due to the relatively high speed moving vehicles there. Vehicles in blind spots and wrong estimations of the distances between vehicles are the main two challenges that en-face drivers while changing their driving lanes. These cases may cause fatal accidents and lead to several damage consequences. This paper aims to investigate and compare the different previous proposed protocols that have been used to control safe lane changing for autonomous vehicles. Moreover, it reviews the intelligent driving assistance protocols that help drivers to safely change their lanes in several scenarios."
9240065,Lateral Control of an Autonomous and Connected Following Vehicle With Limited Preview Information,"Lateral control of an autonomous and connected vehicle (ACV), especially in emergency situations, is important from the safety viewpoint. In these situations, the trajectory to be followed by an ACV must either be planned in real-time (e.g., for a possible evasion maneuver if the obstacle to be avoided is detected) or be communicated from its preceding vehicle. Typically, the trajectory information is available to the following ACV in the form of GPS time samples. From the viewpoint of lateral control, the lateral velocity information is not readily available and the feedback structure must reflect this reality. In this paper, we develop a methodology to synthesize a lateral control algorithm for a following ACV in a two-vehicle platoon in two steps: 1) From the limited preview information of the trajectory to be tracked via samples of GPS way points, we estimate the radius of curvature of the trajectory using “least-square” estimation and 2) develop a fixed-structure feedback control scheme for following the predecessor by synthesizing the set of stabilizing gains corresponding to lateral position error, heading error and heading rate error. Numerical simulation and experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes."
9348575,An LS-SVM control method for path following of autonomous ground vehicles,"In this paper, we investigate the Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) control for path following problem of autonomous ground vehicles (AGV). Firstly, the steering angle input and the lateral offset output of the path following system model which is the two degree of freedom (DOF) vehicle model with integrated vision model are collected to form the training data of the LS-SVM model. Then, the LS- SVM model for the path following of vehicle is trained from the collected data and the controller is solved from the LS-SVM model. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is validated by the performance of the closed-loop path following system in Matlab/Simulink."
8715467,Path Following Control of Autonomous Ground Vehicle Based on Nonsingular Terminal Sliding Mode and Active Disturbance Rejection Control,"Due to the strong nonlinearity, coupling characteristics, external disturbance, and complex driving conditions, it is difficult to establish an accurate mathematical model for the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV). This requires the AGV path following controller to have strong robustness. In this paper, a robust AGV path following control strategy that is based on nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is presented. First, the complex path following problem is simplified to a simple yaw angle tracking problem by constructing a desired yaw angle function that satisfies that the displacement deviation of AGV converges to zero when the actual yaw angle approaches the desired yaw angle. Second, an NTSM-ADRC controller is designed for the system, which uses the extended state observer to estimate and compensate the unmodeled dynamics and unknown external perturbations of the system in real time. In order to improve response characteristics of the controller, the nonlinear error feedback control law is designed by combining the NTSM and exponential approximation law. In contrast to the existing work, the improved controller can use the simple two-degree-of-freedom linear vehicle dynamic model to provide good performance in a range of driving conditions. Finally, the CarSim-Simulink simulation results of typical conditions show that the proposed control strategy can make the AGV follow the reference path quickly and accurately while ensuring the stability of the vehicle and has strong robustness."
8976170,Deep Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Path Following of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) plays an increasingly important role in ocean exploration. Existing AUVs are usually not fully autonomous and generally limited to pre-planning or pre-programming tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning have been introduced into the AUV design and research to improve its autonomy. However, these methods are still difficult to apply directly to the actual AUV system because of the sparse rewards and low learning efficiency. In this paper, we proposed a deep interactive reinforcement learning method for path following of AUV by combining the advantages of deep reinforcement learning and interactive RL. In addition, since the human trainer cannot provide human rewards for AUV when it is running in the ocean and AUV needs to adapt to a changing environment, we further propose a deep reinforcement learning method that learns from both human rewards and environmental rewards at the same time. We test our methods in two path following tasks-straight line and sinusoids curve following of AUV by simulating in the Gazebo platform. Our experimental results show that with our proposed deep interactive RL method, AUV can converge faster than a DQN learner from only environmental reward. Moreover, AUV learning with our deep RL from both human and environmental rewards can also achieve a similar or even better performance than that with deep interactive RL and can adapt to the actual environment by further learning from environmental rewards."
9575292,Surrounding Vehicle Trajectory Prediction and Dynamic Speed Planning for Autonomous Vehicle in Cut-in Scenarios,"Motion planning and vehicle prediction play an important role for autonomous vehicle, which aims to guarantee the driving safety under cut-in scenarios. This paper presents a hybrid prediction model for computing the future trajectory of the surrounding vehicles and a dynamic speed planner based on model predictive control to avoid collisions. Firstly, the hybrid prediction model combines the physics-based model and behavior-based model through Mamdani fuzzy logic. The predicted physic trajectory is computed using the constant yaw rate and velocity vehicle model. In addition, the prediction of driving intention is accomplished by using information of the difference between current motion and driving lanes. Furthermore, the predicted behavior trajectory is selected from the candidate quintic polynomial trajectory cluster through the designed cost function. Then, Gaussian propagation is applied at the fusion trajectory to compute the uncertainty distribution. Secondly, the dynamic speed planner based on model predictive control provides the optimal control command for the collision avoidance maneuver, which considers the future trajectory distribution of surrounding vehicles. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation in different cut-in scenarios."
9220830,MPC-Based Energy Management Strategy for an Autonomous Hybrid Electric Vehicle,"Despite the current intense research on each of the subjects of electrification and autonomous driving, potential advantages as a result of the interaction of these two mainstreams in automotive have not been effectively studied yet. Autonomous vehicles generate an unprecedented amount of real-time data due to excessive use of perception sensors and processing units. In this article, we present a novel approach for improving the fuel economy of an autonomous hybrid electric vehicle by taking advantage of this qrydata. We introduce the term of autonomous-specific energy management strategy (ASEMS) and we present an example of such a strategy using model predictive control (MPC). Specifically, we show how a more fuel-optimal energy management strategy (EMS) can be achieved for the power-split powertrain of an autonomous hybrid electric vehicle using the motion planning data. We use an optimization-based motion planning approach and feed the resulting velocity profile up to the prediction horizon to the MPC-based EMS. The presented approach shows 2% to 12.81% less fuel consumption for the two extreme cases of 100 and 1000 meters as the prediction horizons, compared to a rule-based EMS. The presented EMS fuel-optimality for the 1000 meters is only 6.91% sub-optimal compared to the globally optimal results of dynamic programming."
9123685,An Overview of Recent Advances in Coordinated Control of Multiple Autonomous Surface Vehicles,"Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are marine vessels capable of performing various marine operations without a crew in a variety of cluttered and hostile water/ocean environments. For complex missions, there are increasing needs for deploying a fleet of ASVs instead of a single one to complete difficult tasks. Cooperative operations with a fleet of ASVs offer great advantages with enhanced capability and efficacy. Despite various application potentials, coordinated motion control of ASVs pose great challenges due to the multiplicity of ASVs, complexity of intravehicle interactions and fleet formation with collision avoidance requirements, and scarcity of communication bandwidths in sea environments. Coordinated control of multiple ASVs has received considerable attention in the last decade. This article provides an overview of recent advances in coordinated control of multiple ASVs. First, some challenging issues and scenarios in motion control of ASVs are presented. Next, coordinated control architecture and methods of multiple ASVs are briefly discussed. Then, recent results on trajectory-guided, path-guided, and target-guided coordinated control of multiple ASVs are reviewed in detail. Finally, several theoretical and technical issues are suggested to direct future investigations including network-based coordination, event-triggered coordination, collision-free coordination, optimization-based coordination, data-driven coordination of ASVs, and task-region-oriented coordination of multiple ASVs and autonomous underwater vehicles."
9625017,Autonomous Driving Security: State of the Art and Challenges,"The autonomous driving industry has mushroomed over the past decade. Although autonomous driving has undoubtedly become one of the most promising technologies of this century, its development faces multiple challenges, of which security is the major concern. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of autonomous driving security. At first, the attack surface of autonomous driving is presented. After an analysis of the operation of autonomous driving in terms of key components and technologies, the security of autonomous driving is elaborated in four dimensions: sensors, operating system, control system, and vehicle-to-everything communication. Sensor security is examined from five components which are mainly responsible for self-positioning and environmental perception. The analysis of operating system security, the second dimension, is concentrated on the robot operating system. Concerning the control system security, controller area network is approached mainly from vulnerabilities and protection measures. The fourth dimension, vehicle-to-everything communication security, is probed from four categories of attacks: authenticity/identification, availability, data integrity, and confidentiality with corresponding solutions. Moreover, the drawbacks of existing methods adopted in the four dimensions are also provided. Finally, a conceptual multi-layer defense framework is proposed to secure the information flow from external communication to the physical autonomous vehicle."
9346000,Interpretable End-to-End Urban Autonomous Driving With Latent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Unlike popular modularized framework, end-to-end autonomous driving seeks to solve the perception, decision and control problems in an integrated way, which can be more adapting to new scenarios and easier to generalize at scale. However, existing end-to-end approaches are often lack of interpretability, and can only deal with simple driving tasks like lane keeping. In this article, we propose an interpretable deep reinforcement learning method for end-to-end autonomous driving, which is able to handle complex urban scenarios. A sequential latent environment model is introduced and learned jointly with the reinforcement learning process. With this latent model, a semantic birdeye mask can be generated, which is enforced to connect with certain intermediate properties in today's modularized framework for the purpose of explaining the behaviors of learned policy. The latent space also significantly reduces the sample complexity of reinforcement learning. Comparison tests in a realistic driving simulator show that the performance of our method in urban scenarios with crowded surrounding vehicles dominates many baselines including DQN, DDPG, TD3 and SAC. Moreover, through masked outputs, the learned model is able to provide a better explanation of how the car reasons about the driving environment."
9294180,Longitudinal Control Algorithm for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles to Avoid Accident with Vulnerable Road Users,"The cooperative perception among connected autonomous vehicles extends the field-of-view of the individual cars and adds significantly to their sensing and collision avoidance capabilities. This feature is particularly useful and essential in avoiding collisions with pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other objects or cars which are obscured in the typical field-of-view of an ego vehicle. This paper proposes a simple to implement but effective longitudinal control algorithm to avoid collisions in a dynamic environment for cooperative autonomous vehicles. The algorithm is applied to ego and lead vehicles to control longitudinal dynamics with appropriate braking based on safety distance modeling. Simulations using dynamic models for both vehicles and pedestrians on a hazardous traffic scenario are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm. The proposed method is also capable of warning and avoiding collisions for several other critical situations that may appear in autonomous driving. The results demonstrate a promising solution for cooperative collision avoidance, which can be further expanded to more complex scenarios."
9304608,Integrated Path-tracking and Control Allocation Controller for Autonomous Electric Vehicle under Limit Handling Condition,"In current literature, a number of studies have separately considered path-tracking (PT) control and control allocation (CA) method, but few of studies have integrated them together. This study proposes an integrated PT and CA method for autonomous electric vehicle with independent steering and driving actuators in the limit handling scenario. The high-level feedback PT controller can determine the desired total tire forces and yaw moment, and is designed to guarantee yaw angle error and lateral deviation converge to zero simultaneously. The low-level CA method is formulated as a compact quadratic programming (QP) optimization formulation to optimally allocate individual control actuator. This CA method is designed for a prototype experiment electric vehicle with particularly steering and driving actuator arrangement. The proposed integrated PT controller is validate through numerical simulation based on a high-fidelity CarMaker model on highspeed limit handling scenario."
9405321,Rely-Guarantee Reasoning about Messaging System for Autonomous Vehicles,"Messaging system as a communicating infrastructure is a safety-critical component of autonomous vehicles. For the purpose of safety certification of Level 4 autonomous driving systems, its necessary to provide a formally verified specification of messaging systems. This paper presents a realistic case study using the PiCore rely-guarantee framework to formally verify the DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) of UISEE autonomous driving systems. We first create an axiom model of messaging systems by extending PiCore, which is reusable for concrete applications. The model supports dynamic configuration of message buffers as well as the automatic generation of the rely and guarantee conditions for compositional reasoning. It is instantiated when developing the formal specification of DGPS. Then, we use the rely-guarantee proof system of PiCore to verify the functional correctness and invariant of DGPS. The specification and its proof provide a strong evidence for the ongoing safety certification of DGPS."
8816259,Variable Structure Control for the Roll Stabilization of the AUV During the Diving Process with a Constant Speed,"This paper presents a variable structure controller for the autonomous underwater vehicle at low speed to reduce the roll during the diving process. Considering the diving of the autonomous underwater vehicle diving with a low speed near surface, the vehicle will experience roll because of the disturbance from waves. Intense roll motion will not only seriously affect the normal operation of underwater vehicles, but also increase navigational resistance. According to the conventional work mode of the fin stabilizer, it is difficult for the underwater vehicle to generate sufficient lift to resist the wave influence at a low speed. So a variable structure controller is proposed to reduce the roll by using the horizontal rudder of AUV on the basis of the underwater vehicle roll model. The simulation results show that the presented method can reduce the roll of the AUV effectively."
9583858,Driving Tasks Transfer Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Decision-Making of Autonomous Vehicles in Unsignalized Intersection,"Knowledge transfer is a promising concept to achieve real-time decision-making for autonomous vehicles. This paper constructs a transfer deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework to transform the driving tasks in the intersection environments. The driving missions at the unsignalized intersection are cast into a left turn, right turn, and running straight for automated vehicles. The goal of the autonomous ego vehicle (AEV) is to drive through the intersection situation efficiently and safely. This objective promotes the studied vehicle to increase its speed and avoid crashing other vehicles. The decision-making policy learned from one driving task is transferred through three transfer rules in another driving mission and evaluated. Simulation results reveal that the decision-making strategies related to similar tasks are transferable and have a high success rate. It indicates that the presented control framework could reduce time consumption and realize online implementation. Therefore, the transfer RL concept is helpful for establishing the real-time decision-making policy for autonomous vehicles."
9190040,Decision-Making Strategy on Highway for Autonomous Vehicles Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Autonomous driving is a promising technology to reduce traffic accidents and improve driving efficiency. In this work, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled decision-making policy is constructed for autonomous vehicles to address the overtaking behaviors on the highway. First, a highway driving environment is founded, wherein the ego vehicle aims to pass through the surrounding vehicles with an efficient and safe maneuver. A hierarchical control framework is presented to control these vehicles, which indicates the upper-level manages the driving decisions, and the lower-level cares about the supervision of vehicle speed and acceleration. Then, the particular DRL method named dueling deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm is applied to derive the highway decision-making strategy. The exhaustive calculative procedures of deep Q-network and DDQN algorithms are discussed and compared. Finally, a series of estimation simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed highway decision-making policy. The advantages of the proposed framework in convergence rate and control performance are illuminated. Simulation results reveal that the DDQN-based overtaking policy could accomplish highway driving tasks efficiently and safely."
9171247,A Survey on Deep Learning for Steering Angle Prediction in Autonomous Vehicles,"Steering angle prediction is critical in the control of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and has attracted the attention of researchers, manufacturers, and insurance companies in the automotive industry. Different Deep Learning (DL) architectures have been applied to predict the steering angle of AVs in various scenarios. A survey on steering angle prediction based on deep learning algorithms can help expert researchers identify those areas that require development. Also, novice researchers can use the survey as a starting point. In this article, we present a broad study on the recent advances made in DL architectures that covers the steering angle prediction of AVs. A new comprehensive taxonomy of the application of DL in steering angle prediction of AVs is created. The survey presents a concise research summary synthesis, and analysis. It is found that most researchers depend on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over other DL architectures in predicting the steering angle of autonomous driving vehicles. Also identified are open research problems. The prominent challenge facing DL-based steering angle prediction of AVs is lack of sufficient real-world datasets, which means that researchers largely depend on data generated from simulated environments. Lastly, alternative viewpoints to solve the identified open research challenges are proposed, pointing towards promising future research directions."
8884676,A Novel Local Motion Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Based on Resistance Network and Model Predictive Control,"This paper presents a novel local motion planning framework in a hierarchical manner for autonomous vehicles to follow a trajectory and agilely avoid obstacles. In the upper layer, a new path-planning method based on the resistance network is applied to plan behaviors (e.g. lane keeping or changing), where the human-like factors can be included to simulate different driver styles, such as the aggressive, moderate, and conservative. The planned results (i.e. the lane-change command and the local planned path) will guide the lower-layer planner to decide the local motion. In the lower layer, for the sake of simplicity and alleviation of the computational burden, two separate model predictive controllers (MPC) based on a point-mass kinematic model are utilized for both longitudinal and lateral motion planning. Finally, a super-twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) based motion tracker is designed to show the feasibility of the proposed decoupled planning method and decide the desired control actions of autonomous vehicles. Several scenarios are defined to comprehensively test and demonstrate the effectiveness and the real-time applicability of the new motion-planning framework. The results show that the proposed method performs very well in the planning and tracking process and takes less than 25 ms for the whole planning process, which can be easily implemented in real-world applications."
9537625,A Hierarchical Anti-Disturbance Path Tracking Control Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles Under Complex Driving Conditions,"Path tracking is one of the most crucial issues of autonomous vehicles, but uncertain factors including road roughness and wind gusts could cause lateral deviation and even divergence of the control system. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical anti-disturbance tracking architecture based on the steer-by-wire (SBW) system to improve tracking accuracy and dynamic stability for autonomous vehicles. The proposed architecture is robust strongly against different types of disturbances in the path tracking process by means of hierarchical decoupling. Firstly, in the upper-layer path tracking module, a robust model predictive control (MPC) method with a feedback correction term calculates the expected front-wheel steering angle. Secondly, in the lower-layer SBW module, a nonlinear high gain rack force observer is proposed to compensate for the generalized rack force disturbance. Then, an improved non-singular fast terminal sliding mode auxiliary control law based on the super-twisting algorithm is presented to attenuate the norm-bounded rack disturbance effectively. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed control architecture can improve the path tracking accuracy and has strong interference resistance and robustness against both modeled and unmodeled disturbances."
8682143,Advanced Vehicle State Monitoring: Evaluating Moving Horizon Estimators and Unscented Kalman Filter,"Active safety systems must be used to manipulate the dynamics of autonomous vehicles to ensure safety. To this end, accurate vehicle information, such as the longitudinal and lateral velocities, is crucial. Measuring these states, however, can be expensive, and the measurements can be polluted by noise. The available solutions often resort to Bayesian filters, such as the Kalman filter, but can be vulnerable and erroneous when the underlying assumptions do not hold. With its clear merits in handling nonlinearities and uncertainties, moving horizon estimation (MHE) can potentially solve the problem and is thus studied for vehicle state estimation. This paper designs an unscented Kalman filter, standard MHE, modified MHE, and recursive least squares MHE to estimate critical vehicle states, respectively. All the estimators are formulated based upon a highly nonlinear vehicle model that is shown to be locally observable. The convergence rate, accuracy, and robustness of the four estimation algorithms are comprehensively characterized and compared under three different driving maneuvres. For MHE-based algorithms, the effects of horizon length and optimization techniques on the computational efficiency and accuracy are also investigated."

The contribution of this work consists in the development, implementation, and validation of two following modes: 1) Exact following: accurate compliance with the reference path. 2) Flexible following: tolerate deviation from the reference path in order to avoid obstacles. The proposed method can easily be integrated into existing frameworks for autonomous vehicles. Therefore our approach is flexible enough to be applied to a large variety of different vehicles. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach an experimental validation is carried out on two autonomous vehicles with major differences in kinematics, weight, and size: A cross-country wheelchair and an off-road truck. Both exact and flexible following have been successfully demonstrated in unstructured outdoor environments."
9455682,Accurate trajectory tracking control of unknown autonomous underwater vehicles: A data-driven predictive approach,"The adaptive tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under the conditions of unavailable kinetic dynamics is considered via developing a new data-driven adaptive predictive control (DAPC) method. By deploying the non-parametric DLT, a new data-based predictive model is first designed such that the unknown kinetic dynamics and nonlinearities in AUV system are efficiently handled. Then, a data-based predictive control law is further devised, and thereby the dynamics of the entire closed-loop AUV system can be appropriately regulated. Finally, numerical simulations pertaining to an underwater vehicle is given to validate the efficiency of the devised method."
9551179,Intelligent Intersection Coordination and Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Vehicles,"Since multiple roads merge at intersections, proper coordination for vehicles is of great importance for modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we try to smartly integrate the infrastructure and vehicle-based planners, to achieve feasible and efficient solutions. In detail, the vehicle reference trajectories can be firstly achieved by the high-level infrastructure-based coordination, which can be formulated as standard quadratic programming (QP) and mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. Due to the possible occurrence of obstacles such as pedestrians, the vehicles are also required to perform low-level ego trajectory optimization based on local observations, which are essentially dynamic programming (DP) and QP problems. Numerical results show that the proposed framework can effectively solve many opening problems in vehicle coordination, such as obstacle avoidance and deadlocks among vehicles."
9423525,Scene-Graph Augmented Data-Driven Risk Assessment of Autonomous Vehicle Decisions,"There is considerable evidence that evaluating the subjective risk level of driving decisions can improve the safety of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) in both typical and complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach that uses scene-graphs as intermediate representations for modeling the subjective risk of driving maneuvers. Our approach includes a Multi-Relation Graph Convolution Network, a Long-Short Term Memory Network, and attention layers. To train our model, we formulate subjective risk assessment as a supervised scene classification problem. We evaluate our model on both synthetic lane-changing datasets and real-driving datasets with various driving maneuvers. We show that our approach achieves a higher classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art approach on both large (96.4% vs. 91.2%) and small (91.8% vs. 71.2%) lane-changing synthesized datasets, illustrating that our approach can learn effectively even from small datasets. We also show that our model trained on a lane-changing synthesized dataset achieves an average accuracy of 87.8% when tested on a real-driving lane-changing dataset. In comparison, the state-of-the-art model trained on the same synthesized dataset only achieved 70.3% accuracy when tested on the real-driving dataset, showing that our approach can transfer knowledge more effectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that the addition of spatial and temporal attention layers improves our model's performance and explainability. Finally, our results illustrate that our model can assess the risk of various driving maneuvers more accurately than the state-of-the-art model (86.5% vs. 58.4%, respectively)."
9232398,C-RAN Enabled Seamless Mobility Mechanism in Autonomous Driving,"Connected autonomous driving has already been a new paradigm of driving for safety, efficiency and mobility. Connected autonomous driving can overcome the perceptual limitations of single vehicle, which has a high demand for high speed and seamless network connection. With the superiority of C-RAN, autonomous driving network can effectively support a vast number of vehicles communications and flexible multi-RRH cooperative transmission to improve throughput. However, due to the high mobility of vehicle, the problem of long latency or even link break caused by frequent hard handover still exists. In this context, based on cooperative transmission and the idea of multiple connections, we studied seamless mobility mechanism in C-RAN enabled autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a user-centric dynamic cooperative cluster updating scheme with the purpose of guaranteeing the seamless of the vehicle during handover process due to mobility. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively solve the interruption latency or link interruption problem caused by handover. And compared with the non-cooperative case, the proposed scheme is superior in throughput gain."
9564635,Control the Autonomous! - User Interfaces for Monitoring and Dispatching Autonomous Vehicles,"The ongoing development of autonomous vehicles offers many opportunities in the field of local public transport, but also makes the monitoring of autonomously driving buses by a control center necessary. It should be noted that there are many different manufacturers of autonomous vehicles. Each manufacturer develops its own individual systems, for example to monitor and control its own manufactured vehicles respective products. Operators and users or dispatchers of vehicles are interested in general tools, such as institutions for public transportation. This paper deals with the development and design of a control interface that enables an operator to monitor moving buses, to handle occurring malfunctions and to answer communication requests from passengers. It doesn't matter which manufacturer systems are present. The analysis of user groups in the form of described personas and the investigation of possible scenarios made it possible to draw conclusions regarding the required functions of such an interface. The resulting concept is subsequently presented decisions made during the development are substantiated. However, bus drivers are critical for conveying passengers with a sense of security and for information sharing. In this paper we also aim to make more steps towards answering the difficult question of how the social role of the vehicle driver can be replaced by user interfaces and a connection between passengers and operators."
9458968,Applying Deep Learning to Autonomous Vehicles: A Survey,"Autonomous vehicles will revolutionize the future automotive industry by reducing or eliminating human errors and increasing vehicle safety. The design of autonomous vehicles will bring together many modern technologies such as control, computer vision, path planning, sensor fusion and fault diagnosis. Although traditional algorithms can be used to implement these technologies, in the last decade, deep learning has been proposed to challenge traditional algorithms and excels in many applications and research areas. Deep learning has shown its significant use in the design and operation of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we will review the application of deep learning in five major research areas of autonomous vehicles i.e. path planning, control, computer vision, sensor fusion and fault diagnosis. Recent advances of the deep learning in autonomous vehicles will be reviewed and discussed."
9428653,An Ellipsoidal Set-Membership Approach to Distributed Joint State and Sensor Fault Estimation of Autonomous Ground Vehicles,"This paper is concerned with the problem of distributed joint state and sensor fault estimation for autonomous ground vehicles subject to unknown-but-bounded (UBB) external disturbance and measurement noise. In order to improve the estimation reliability and performance in cases of poor data collection and potential communication interruption, a multi-sensor network configuration is presented to cooperatively measure the vehicular yaw rate, and further compute local state and fault estimates. Toward this aim, an augmented descriptor vehicle model is first established, where the unknown sensor fault is modeled as an auxiliary state of the system model. Then, a new distributed ellipsoidal set-membership estimation approach is developed so as to construct an optimized bounding ellipsoidal set which guarantees to contain the vehicle's true state and the sensor fault at each time step despite the existence of UBB disturbance and measurement noises. Furthermore, a convex optimization algorithm is put forward such that the gain matrix of each distributed estimator can be recursively obtained. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
8867003,Adaptive Control System for Autonomous Vehicle Path Following,"Autonomy in vehicles is a rapidly expanding technology that is of interest in many major car companies. Autonomous driving enables safer journeys by removing human error in driving, as well as reducing driving time and fuel consumption by optimizing the engine and brake actuation. While certain autonomous functions in cars have been in use for over a decade, such as lane keeping and automatic parking these features are subject to specific scenarios. A fully automated vehicle needs to take into account the unpredictable and complex environments that cars drive in. The idea of a self-driving car in a city environment needs specific requirements such as reliable path following, accurate sensor data and safe drive. The scope of this paper is to create a simple path following solution which enables an autonomous car to accurately traverse along any given path."
9621769,Vehicle Behavior Measurement based-on RTK-GNSS for Driver’s Risk Feeling Estimation,"In order to approach the epoch of the autonomous vehicle, the driver’s risk feeling in the situation under these support technologies have to measure in the actual vehicle. These measured data can be used to improve systems and construct more safe road environment. Therefore, in this paper, a vehicle behavior measurement system (VBMS) in actual vehicles is developed. VBMS is constructed to vehicle platoon which are a leading vehicle and a following vehicle, and can obtain the velocity of vehicle, the global position, various data of Controller Area Network (CAN Data) and videos of the ahead view."
8318894,Adaptive Autonomous Underwater Vehicles: An Assessment of Their Effectiveness for Oceanographic Applications,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are practical tools for ocean observation. However, they tend to operate in an automatic rather than autonomous way. This reflects the attitudes and behaviors that individuals and organizations share when adopting new technology in this industry. This paper clarifies the factors that are preventing one important aspect of autonomy-adaptive mission planning (AMP)-from transitioning from research to commercial and bespoke AUVs. A total of 25 experts comprising AUV developers and users, with combined 237 years of experience, provided their views in a structured survey covering several different hypotheses. There is insufficient evidence to determine clearly a single reason for failure to adopt AMPs, but a primary cause is the paucity of demonstration trials. This view is irrespective of participants' years of experience. Managers, engineers, and technologists agree on the two most likely causes for failure to adopt AMPs. However, the differences between the assessments provided by researchers and these three professional groups are statistically significant, with p value <;0.005. For researchers, complexity is one of the two most important inhibitory factors. We present recommendations to support the integration of AMP into AUVs substantiated by recent examples where government, industry, and researchers have developed and tested AMPs."
9133747,Revealing pedestrian behaviors to support the decision-making of autonomous vehicles,"Before the widespread use of autonomous vehicles, it is needed to reveal the travelers' intentions and behavior patterns; with the conclusions gained appropriate response can be provided by the vehicle in a conflict situation. This paper focuses on vehicle-pedestrian conflict points. The aim was to elaborate a method to prevent pedestrians from being hit by an autonomous vehicle. Typical pedestrian movements have been identified by an on-site measurement and a questionnaire survey. Pedestrian crossing patterns were categorized based on the onsite measurement, whereas general habits and feelings behind a crossing were identified by the questionnaire survey. We found that the typical approach angle of a crossing point is 90 degrees. Moreover, the movements approaching a crossing point are strongly influenced by the environment (e.g. location of public transportation stop). Additionally, crossing behavior is strongly influenced by gender. The results support the prediction of pedestrians' position, which can be used in the software development of autonomous vehicles."
9172804,Autonomous Search for Underground Mine Rescue Using Aerial Robots,"In this paper we present a comprehensive solution for autonomous underground mine rescue using aerial robots. In particular, a new class of Micro Aerial Vehicles are equipped with the ability to localize and map in subterranean settings, explore unknown mine environments on their own, and perform detection and localization of objects of interest for the purposes of mine rescue (i.e., “human survivors” and associated objects such as “backpacks”, “smartphones” or “tools”). For the purposes of GPS-denied localization and mapping in the visually-degraded underground environments (e.g., a smoke-filled mine during an accident) the solution relies on the fusion of LiDAR data with thermal vision frames and inertial cues. Autonomous exploration is enabled through a graph-based search algorithm and an online volumetric representation of the environment. Object search is then enabled through a deep learning-based classifier, while the associated location is queried using the online reconstructed map. The complete software framework runs onboard the aerial robots utilizing the integrated embedded processing resources. The overall system is extensively evaluated in real-life deployments in underground mines."
9024122,A Formation Autonomous Navigation System for Unmanned Surface Vehicles With Distributed Control Strategy,"By deploying unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), the efficiency and reliability of mission execution can be improved. This paper is concerned with the problem of formation autonomous navigation system (FANS) for USVs. The decision layer of the system is composed of path planning subsystem and navigation control subsystem to realize fast and effective autonomous navigation system. The FANS is constructed by leader-follower structure and distributed control strategy, which make the individuals in the formation have certain autonomy. The dynamic domain tunable fast marching square algorithm proposed in the path planning subsystem can not only adjust the safety and length of the path planned, but also continuously re-plan the path according to the motion information of the USV formation and target-vessels. Navigation control subsystem based on finite control set model predictive control can quickly and safely guide and control formation in local sea environment. The simulation tests are carried out in static and dynamic harbor environments respectively, which verifies the ability of the FANS to achieve stable formation tracking and autonomous safe navigation."
8675462,MME-EKF-Based Path-Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Considering Input Saturation,"This paper investigates the path-tracking control issue for autonomous ground vehicles with the integral sliding mode control (ISMC) considering the transient performance improvement. The path-tracking control is converted into the yaw stabilization problem, where the sideslip-angle compensation is adopted to reduce the steady-state errors, and then the yaw-rate reference is generated for the path-tracking purpose. The lateral velocity and roll angle are estimated with the measurement of the yaw rate and roll rate. Three contributions have been made in this paper: first, to enhance the estimation accuracy for the vehicle states in the presence of the parametric uncertainties caused by the lateral and roll dynamics, a robust extended Kalman filter is proposed based on the minimum model error algorithm; second, an improved adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) considering the approximation error adaptation is developed to compensate for the uncertainties caused by the vertical motion; third, the RBFNN and composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) based ISMC is developed to achieve the yaw stabilization and enhance the transient tracking performance considering the input saturation of the front steering angle. The overall stability is proved with Lyapunov function. Finally, the superiority of the developed control strategy is verified by comparing with the traditional CNF with high-fidelity CarSim-MATLAB simulations."
9033734,Performance of Open Autonomous Vehicle Platforms: Autoware and Apollo,"Fatalities due to human reckless driving and technological advancements makes all automobile companies to work towards autonomous vehicles. Making autonomous car platforms from scratch would be difficult therefore some middleware framework like Robot Operating System (ROS) which consists of pre-built software libraries can be used for self-driving. This paper throws light upon the main existing ROS based open software platforms, Autoware and Apollo and their algorithms required for scene understanding, path planning, and vehicle control."
8943978,Improvements to Terrain Aided Navigation Accuracy in Deep-Sea Space by High Precision Particle Filter initialization,"AUV (autonomous underwater vehicles) are required to have long-term and high-precision positioning capability relative to seabed targets in most deep-sea exploration tasks. However, acoustic positioning error is positively correlated with its operating range and inertial navigation has inevitable accumulated time errors, neither of which provide precise AUV positions. TAN (terrain aided navigation) directly calculates the AUV position to the seabed terrain coordinate system by tracking the seabed topographic characteristics, which can guide the AUV to seabed target accurately. However, the initial TAN positioning error will increase with the AUV operation depth, which causes a large PF (particle filter) initialization error and particle coverage interval, and will affect the convergence and stability of TAN. To solve this problem, we first propose a TAP (terrain aided position) confidence interval model. We then use the confidence interval to constrain the initial particles to a smaller range. Finally, the validity of the algorithm is verified by playback simulation with ship-borne multi-beam sonar sensor measured data. The results show that the TAP confidence interval can reduce the coverage of the initial particle, and can improve the convergence speed and filtering accuracy of the TAN."
9348553,A Cache Strategy for Intelligent Transportation System to Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Traffic congestion is a major problem in metropolitan areas, which inevitably leads to substantial social and economic impacts. In the Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) context, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) addresses routing techniques for building an efficient transportation system in an urban environment. In order to improve traffic management, CAVs use real-time traffic data to disseminate faster routes for vehicles. Meanwhile, Cloud Computing is used to manage the traffic congestion situation, but it is not a suitable option for low-latency requirements of autonomous vehicles. Fog-based approaches dealing with traffic congestion found in the literature do not consider the use of caching for a routing scheme. Therefore, we propose a reliable caching mechanism for autonomous vehicle path planning based on Fog Computing, which is called ReCall. ReCall caches real-time traffic information from different regions to dynamically perform route recommendations. The results have shown that ReCall is able to reduce travel time and emissions."
9347802,Game Theory-Based Control Strategy For Trajectory Following of Four-Wheel Independently Actuated Autonomous Vehicles,"Trajectory Following Control (TFC) and lateral stability control are always significant for Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs). However, sometimes it is quite a challenge to achieve excellent tracking performance with less stability loss. In this paper, a novel two-agent non-cooperative game framework is built to explore the coordination approach of the integrated TFC and Direct Yaw Control (DYC) issue. Then the game theory-based control strategies are proposed and two information patterns are investigated. In the open-loop case, the Nash equilibrium of each control cycle is determined by solving discrete-time Riccati equations. When it comes to the closed-loop pattern, the game complexity increases because each player can revise his own game strategy according to the other players’ strategy evolution, and thus the dynamic programming method based on the Bellman's principle is applied to derive the control strategies. Besides, a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) method is adopted to facilitate the process of discretizing the state-space model in every control cycle. Finally, simulation tests based on Carsim-Simulink joint platform and experimental tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
8700619,Multimodel Approach to Personalized Autonomous Adaptive Cruise Control,"Autonomous vehicles are gaining increased attention but surveys have shown that a large percentage of people are wary of adopting the new technology. One possible explanation for the hesitancy is that the occupant would not be comfortable with the driving style as a result of the control models and their parameters as set by the manufacture. Comfort level is subjective in nature and therefore varies between individuals. To combat this issue, autonomous vehicles must be able to adapt to the driving style preference of the user. If we assume drivers are more comfortable with their own driving style, we can choose to have the vehicle learn and incorporate the driver's style into the control models. However, there is still no widely accepted “best” model. One model may prove to better represent a particular driver than other models though a driver may choose unsafe driving conditions, the replication of which should not take precedence over the safety of the occupant. In this paper, we propose a multimodel approach to find the best driver model for describing an individual's longitudinal driving style on highway. A method for extracting the indicators of an individual's driving style is proposed first. Then, a multimodel-based evaluation method is described in detail. Chandler, Herman, & Montroll, General Motors Nonlinear, Tampère, Addison & Low, Optimal Velocity Model, and Neural Network models are trained and compared in this paper. The model with the best performance in replicating driving style is further coupled with a model predictive controller to include safety constraints for safer driving. Finally, the proposed multimodel approach is tested with driving data collected from five different drivers. The test results show that our multimodel-based approach is showing advantage over a single model approach in imitating an individual's longitudinal driving style."
8836761,Target Area Surveillance Optimization with Swarms of Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles,"Reconnaissance mission success within deep enemy territory or surveillance of a targeted remote area requiring fast and reliable data collection is many times a daunting task. The characteristics of particular missions dictate the area coverage, objects of interest, timing constraints, and last but not the least, the type of deployed system and its capabilities. The advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) over the past decade enhanced surveillance/reconnaissance/monitoring maneuvers for both military missions and civilian rescue operations. More recently, the UAV design and development has evolved also towards miniaturizing the actual aerial system and cooperation among a swarm of micro aerial vehicles (MAV). This work focuses on the optimization of a MAV swarm deployment in hostile territory. The reconnaissance mission success is given by the percentage of data collection within timing, distributed data storage, collision avoidance, and swarm MAV mission integrity constraints. A proof of concept simulation was built to evaluate the correctness of the swarm MAV model deployment and serves as the starting point for a larger deployment model simulation."
9620938,Analysis of Coexistence between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Wireless Devices below 1GHz,"As many unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) are applied in various industries and services, concerns about the illegal use of UAVs are highly increasing. UAVs can be easily used for crime due to their ability of remote control and low probability of revealing the pilot's identity. Previously, detecting and removal have been major measures to counter illegal UAVs. However, in order to construct an effective defense system against illegal activities by UAVs, remote identification of the unique ID assigned to each UAV is necessity. Thus, frequency allocation is required in advance. In this paper, candidate frequencies below 1GHz for remote identification of UAVs are selected through investigation of technical regulations. In addition, coexistence between UAVs and existing wireless devices at the selected candidate frequencies are analyzed. Based on the minimum coupling loss, the separation distances between UAVs and the wireless devices are estimated."
9633825,Strawberry Plant's Health Detection for Organic Farming Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Demand for agricultural produce has drastically increased in recent years. Meeting these demands require expansion of agricultural area and organic farming. Lack of monitoring arises in such expansive areas. Which can lead to overlooking infected plants. Failing in spotting these infected plants can lead to irreversible damage to the plant and this leading to yield loss. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's)are actively being used to tackle large scale agricultural problems. In this paper, we are equipping UAV's with system that not only identifies the healthy strawberry plants and infected strawberry plants but also indicates the possible disease the strawberry plants might have. With this proposed methodology, farmer can efficiently locate and handle the treatment of the infected strawberry plants"
8805717,Impact of Autonomous Vehicles in Cities: User Perception,"Autonomous driving is a very important topic aiming on changing mobility in smart cities. A lot of research has been dedicated to development of vehicles without drivers and quite many tests and real world demonstrations have been reported especially in the last years. The first expectations were very optimistic. Researchers as well as general public expected high positive influence in the congestions, travel time and other mobility aspects. However, the latest research questions these purely positive expectations and suggest that autonomous driving might have positive or negative effect based on city policies in place.In order to gain a better understanding about the current expectations of general public about the impact of autonomous driving, a survey has been conducted as part of a European project MAVEN. This paper provides a short description of the survey design and then summarizes the main findings and results of this survey. The results can get us a better way to understand the feeling of citizens about autonomous vehicles and the transition to full automated cities.The results confirmed the general trends and at the same time gave us more insight into the special questions related to MAVEN use cases. These findings will be further validated in simulation experiments."
9478933,Safe Reinforcement Learning With Stability Guarantee for Motion Planning of Autonomous Vehicles,"Reinforcement learning with safety constraints is promising for autonomous vehicles, of which various failures may result in disastrous losses. In general, a safe policy is trained by constrained optimization algorithms, in which the average constraint return as a function of states and actions should be lower than a predefined bound. However, most existing safe learning-based algorithms capture states via multiple high-precision sensors, which complicates the hardware systems and is power-consuming. This article is focused on safe motion planning with the stability guarantee for autonomous vehicles with limited size and power. To this end, the risk-identification method and the Lyapunov function are integrated with the well-known soft actor–critic (SAC) algorithm. By borrowing the concept of Lyapunov functions in the control theory, the learned policy can theoretically guarantee that the state trajectory always stays in a safe area. A novel risk-sensitive learning-based algorithm with the stability guarantee is proposed to train policies for the motion planning of autonomous vehicles. The learned policy is implemented on a differential drive vehicle in a simulation environment. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a higher success rate than the SAC."
9265501,Applications of Successive Convexification in Autonomous Vehicle Planning and Control,"In this paper, we present the application of successive convexification methods to autonomous driving problems borrowed from recent aerospace literature. We formulate two optimization problems within the successive convexification framework. Using arc-length parametrization in the vehicle kinematic model, we solve the speed planning and model predictive control problems with a range of constraints and obstacle configurations. In addition, we show a simple application of logical state-trigger constraints in a continuous formulation of the optimization by including an evasion maneuver in the simulations section."
8672592,Collision Avoidance for Underactuated Marine Vehicles Using the Constant Avoidance Angle Algorithm,"Avoiding collisions is a crucial ability for unmanned vehicles. In this paper, we present the constant avoidance angle algorithm, a reactive method for collision avoidance. It can be used to avoid both static and moving obstacles by making the vehicle keep an avoidance angle between itself and the obstacle edge. Unlike many other algorithms, it requires neither knowledge of the complete obstacle shape nor that the vehicle follows a desired speed trajectory. Instead, safe vehicle headings are provided at the current vehicle speed. Thus, the speed can be used as an input to the algorithm, which provides flexibility and makes the approach suitable for a wide range of vehicles, including vehicles with a limited speed envelope or high acceleration cost. We demonstrate this by applying the algorithm to a marine vehicle described by a full kinematic and dynamic model in three degrees of freedom. We specifically consider vehicles with underactuated sway dynamics, where the vehicle velocity contains a component that cannot be directly controlled. Such dynamics can be highly detrimental to the performance of collision avoidance algorithms and need to be included in the design and analysis of control systems for such vehicles. In this paper, we compensate for the underactuation by including these dynamics in the underlying analysis and control design. We provide a mathematical analysis of sparse obstacle scenarios, where we derive conditions under which safe avoidance is guaranteed, even for underactuated vehicles. We furthermore show how the modular nature of the algorithm enables it to be combined both with a target reaching and a path following guidance law. Finally, we validate the results both through numerical simulations and through full-scale experiments aboard the R/V Gunnerus."
9058714,Achieving Resiliency and Behavior Assurance in Autonomous Navigation: An Industry Perspective,"In this article, we present an industry perspective on key drivers for autonomous navigation, with a particular focus on resiliency and behavior assurance. We provide a brief survey of current deployed mobile autonomous systems and their capabilities (with a primary focus on the air domain but including other domains-underwater, ground, space, and surface-as well). We discuss techniques that are currently used for achieving resiliency and assurance in autonomous navigation, pointing out some of the shortcomings of these techniques. We describe techniques under development in the industry that aims to overcome these shortcomings by combining emerging approaches to resilient behavior with assured autonomous behavior constructs to yield reliable and mission-effective systems necessary to operate successfully in dynamic and adversarial environments. We briefly discuss ongoing efforts to develop multidomain standards that are designed to be applicable across these disparate vehicle domains."
8952619,Millimeter-Wave Communication for a Last-Mile Autonomous Transport Vehicle,"Low-speed autonomous transport of passengers and goods is expected to have a strong, positive impact on the reliability and ease of travelling. Various advanced functions of the involved vehicles rely on the wireless exchange of information with other vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, thereby benefitting from the low latency and high throughput characteristics that 5G technology has to offer. This work presents an investigation of 5G millimeter-wave communication links for a low-speed autonomous vehicle, focusing on the effects of the antenna positions on both the received signal quality and the link performance. It is observed that the excess loss for communication with roadside infrastructure in front of the vehicle is nearly half-power beam width independent, and the increase of the root mean square delay spread plays a minor role in the resulting signal quality, as the absolute times are considerably shorter than the typical duration of 5G New Radio symbols. Near certain threshold levels, a reduction of the received power affects the link performance through an increased error vector magnitude of the received signal, and subsequent decrease of the achieved data throughput."
8916845,Lane Change Maneuver based on Bezier Curve providing Comfort Experience for Autonomous Vehicle Users,"Comfort driving has emerged as an important topic in the autonomous car research field. This study focuses on lane change maneuvering (LCM) of autonomous vehicles to provide a comfortable driving experience for passengers. For this purpose, we propose an LCM algorithm for determining a desired trajectory by evaluating the allowable lateral acceleration value obtained from Bezier curves at a local path planning stage for comfortable and smooth motion of the vehicle. The performance of the proposed LCM algorithm was verified through computer simulations and real driving tests."
9188611,An Improved Model Predictive Control Method for Vehicle Lateral Control,"This paper presents a lateral dynamic model based on control algorithm for the path tracking of autonomous vehicle. To improve the stability of the vehicle for high speed cases, an improved model predictive control (MPC) controller has been proposed in this paper. By combining the steady state response and MPC, the lateral motion of the autonomous vehicle can be controlled smoothly and the accuracy of path tracking can be guaranteed at a high speed. A number of simulation results obtained by using MATLAB are provided to validate this methodology."
9343221,Factors Affecting Trust in the Autonomous Vehicle: A Survey of Primary School Students and Parent Perceptions,"With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, autonomous vehicles are expected to perform all driving functions under certain conditions. In fact, some people have even proposed the concept of autonomous school buses. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles exhibit the great potential to become not only the primary alternative to human-driven vehicles during a child's journey to school, but also the vehicles used by today's children as they enter adulthood. However, the acceptance of such vehicles depends on both the children and their parents' trust in this new technology. Hence, this study explores the relationships among perceived usefulness, defects, and risks as well as negative emotions and degree of trust in autonomous vehicles. Based on an online survey of 131 primary school students and 133 parents, the current study concludes that the perceived benefits, perceived risks, and emotional responses influence people's trust in this new technology. Moreover, the results of a regression analysis find two critical factors that influence trust in autonomous vehicles, namely, perceived risk of traffic safety and perceived defects in the vehicle. Additionally, while perceived usefulness is an exclusive predictor of adults' trust, negative emotions only significantly predict the trust of children in the vehicle. For trust in autonomous vehicles, these primary school students share similar perceptions with those of their parents. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to compare people's trust in autonomous vehicles between primary school students and their parents. These findings may inspire the design and promotion of autonomous vehicles for school journeys, thus resulting in increasingly more families trusting and accepting this new technology."
9693282,Robust Adaptive Path-Tracking Control of Autonomous Ground Vehicles with Considerations of Steering System Backlash,"Backlash phenomena have haunted control engineers for ages. Concerning the ground vehicle path-tracking control system design, the steering systems backlash attribute is often overlooked. If not properly compensated, the backlash nonlinearity tends to provoke unfavorable consequences including erroneous positioning of the road-wheel steering angle, response chattering, limit-cycle-like oscillations, and delays. This paper pioneers to employ an adaptive inverse controller to offset the dynamics of the steering systems backlash. Overall, the path-following objective is accomplished via a novel trio-loop control architecture, which decomposes the tracking objectives into kinematic, vehicular lateral dynamics, and steering backlash compensation sub-levels. All adaptive control laws are robustified by means of -modifications. Hardware-in-the-loop experimental results are presented to demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed solution."
8704298,"Cooperative Routing Problem for Ground Vehicle and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: The Application on Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Missions","In this paper, we investigate a novel two-echelon ground vehicle and its mounted unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative routing problem (2E-GUCRP) for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. In a typical cooperative system with ground vehicle (GV) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the UAV is launched from the GV, automatically flies to the designated target and return to the GV before powering off. Meanwhile, acting as a mobile platform, the GV can carry the UAV moving in a larger region and charge or exchange the UAV's battery. The objective is to design efficient GV and UAV routes to minimize the total mission time while meeting the operational constraints. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model, which could be solved by commercial software (e.g. CPLEX), is developed to formulate the problem. In order to quickly solve the medium-scale or above problems, two heuristics are designed. The random instances and practical case based on the road network in Changsha, China, are used for experiments. The computational results indicate that, compared to the mode of two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), the cooperative GV and UAV can complete the ISR missions in a much shorter time through utilizing the proposed 2E-GUCRP mode. Furthermore, discussion of the practical instance points out that the increase in efficiency is related to the speed relationship between the GV and the UAV."
9248357,Learning based Predictive Error Estimation and Compensator Design for Autonomous Vehicle Path Tracking,"Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used for path tracking of autonomous vehicles due to its ability to handle various types of constraints. However, a considerable predictive error exists because of the error of mathematics model or the model linearization. In this paper, we propose a framework combining the MPC with a learning-based error estimator and a feedforward compensator to improve the path tracking accuracy. An extreme learning machine is implemented to estimate the model based predictive error from vehicle state feedback information. Offline training data is collected from a vehicle controlled by a model-defective regular MPC for path tracking in several working conditions, respectively. The data include vehicle state and the spatial error between the current actual position and the corresponding predictive position. According to the estimated predictive error, we then design a PID-based feedforward compensator. Simulation results via Carsim show the estimation accuracy of the predictive error and the effectiveness of the proposed framework for path tracking of an autonomous vehicle."
9352914,Network Emulation For Tele-driving Application Development,"We present a co-emulation framework for Connected Autonomous Vehicle for development and validation of technologies for teleoperation of semi-autonomous vehicles. Despite several technical advancements in the autonomous vehicles' domain, Automated Driving System (ADS) deployments were limited to SAE [1] level-3. Remote driving capability offers a promising fallback option. In order to establish a technology stack over existing and new network infrastructure, we need a simulation or emulation framework, to test the system before deploying it on the road. Our framework enables testing with an actual vehicle and a simulated network, and we demonstrate a tele-driving use-case of a retrofitted electric car."
8771214,Multi-Task Regression-Based Learning for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Flight Control Within Unstructured Outdoor Environments,"Increased growth in the global unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) (drone) industry has expanded possibilities for fully autonomous UAV applications. A particular application which has in part motivated this research is the use of UAV in wide area search and surveillance operations in unstructured outdoor environments. The critical issue with such environments is the lack of structured features that could aid in autonomous flight, such as road lines or paths. In this letter, we propose an end-to-end multi-task regression-based learning approach capable of defining flight commands for navigation and exploration under the forest canopy, regardless of the presence of trails or additional sensors (i.e., GPS). Training and testing are performed using a software in the loop pipeline, which allows for a detailed evaluation against state-of-the-art pose estimation techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in performing dense exploration within the required search perimeter, is capable of covering wider search regions, generalises to previously unseen and unexplored environments and outperforms contemporary state-ofthe-art techniques."
8814864,A Real-Time Optimal Eco-driving Approach for Autonomous Vehicles Crossing Multiple Signalized Intersections,"This paper develops a methodology for obtaining an optimal acceleration/speed profile for a single autonomous vehicle crossing multiple signalized intersections without stopping in free flow mode. We aim to minimize an objective function that involves a trade-off between travel time and energy consumption of autonomous vehicles. Our design approach differs from most existing approaches based on numerical calculations: it begins with identifying the structure of the optimal acceleration profile and then showing that it is characterized by several parameters, which are used for design optimization. Therefore, the infinite dimensional optimal control problem is transformed into a finite dimensional parametric optimization problem, which enables a real-time online analytical solution. We include simulation results to show quantitatively the advantages of considering multiple intersections jointly rather than dealing with them individually. Based on mild assumptions, the optimal eco-driving algorithm is readily extended to include interfering traffic."
9206278,Detecting Deception Attacks on Autonomous Vehicles via Linear Time-Varying Dynamic Watermarking,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as autonomous vehicles rely on both on-board sensors and external communications to estimate their state. Unfortunately these communications render the system vulnerable to cyber-attacks. While many attack detection methods have begun to address these concerns they are limited to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI system models provide accurate approximations for CPS such as autonomous vehicles at constant speed and turning radii they are inaccurate for more complex motions such as lane changes turns and changes in velocity. Since these more complex motions are more suitably described by linear time-varying (LTV) system models rather than LTI models Dynamic Watermarking which adds a private excitation to the input signal to validate measurements has recently been extended to LTV systems. However this extension does not allow for LTV systems that require several steps before the ef ect of a given control input can be seen in the measurement signal. Additionally there is no consideration for the time-varying effects of auto-correlation. Furthermore a proof of concept was only provided using simulations of a simplified model. This paper relaxes the requirement for inputs to be visible in a single step and constructs an auto-correlation normalizing factor to remove the effects of auto-correlation. In addition, Dynamic Watermarking is applied to a high-fidelity vehicle model in CarSim TM and a 1/10 scale autonomous rover to further reinforce the proof of concept for realistic systems. In each case, the vehicle follows a predefined path with time-varying velocity and turning radii. A replay attack, which replays previously recorded measurements, is shown to be detectable using LTV Dynamic Watermarking in a quick and repeatable manner."
8804549,A new optimal control of obstacle avoidance for safer autonomous driving,"The autonomous vehicle is one of the greatest challenges in modern vehicle design. This paper proposes a new method of control named FLOP, Feedback Local Optimality Principle, recently proposed by the authors. The method, starting from the Pontryagin's theory, introduces a new optimality principle that minimizes a sequence of individual functionals with the chance of a direct feedback control. The theory is applied to the steering and traction control of a two-wheeled vehicle, showing the ability of tracking a given trajectory, obstacles avoidance in a complex environment and measuring the benefits for driving safety."
9660094,Using Particle Swarm Optimization to Learn a Lane Change Model for Autonomous Vehicle Merging,"This paper presents the results of experiments applying a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach to lane changing for autonomous vehicles. The lane change model proposed is rule-based, where PSO learns the parameters of the rules. A study was conducted to compare the proposed lane change model to the existing lane change model in the microscopic simulator, SUMO. Experiments performed include simulating vehicles using the Krauss car-following model with the SUMO lane change model, with the proposed PSO lane change model, and with all lane changing decisions turned off. The latter case, where merges are replaced by vehicle reset, serves as a baseline for missed merge opportunities. The objective was to develop an adaptive approach to improve merge efficiency as an example of lane changing behavior. Varying vehicle densities and levels of congestion on the merge lane and through-lane were tested. Empirical results show the proposed lane change model is able to learn merging strategies with minimal collisions and is comparable to the SUMO lane change model in some scenarios. Further investigation is needed to improve performance and safety, but initial results show promise for the proposed PSO-based approach to autonomous lane changing."
9277630,Reinforcement Learning for Connected Autonomous Vehicle Localization via UAVs,"In precision farming, a very promising scenario is represented by a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) moving in a cultivated field and collecting high-resolution videos and hyperspectral images, requiring both localization and broadband communication. An effective approach to provide both localization and wideband communication exploits unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that may act as relays to ensure seamless connectivity with a base station (BS). In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to find the best spatial configuration of a swarm of UAVs to localize a CAV in an unknown environment and assist the communication with a BS. The UAVs cooperate to estimate the position of the CAV exploiting only the received signal strength (RSS). A reward function, based on the distance between the UAVs and the CAV, and the estimated geometric diluition of precision (GDOP), is designed. Numerical results show how the proposed multi-agent Q-learning allows the UAVs to reach low root mean square error (RMSE) in the target localization, even without previous knowledge about the environment."
9157931,Trajectory Planning and Tracking Strategy Applied to an Unmanned Ground Vehicle in the Presence of Obstacles,"In a dynamic environment, moving to the destination safely and effectively is of paramount importance for an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). This article presents a strategy of trajectory planning and tracking that aims to ensure the UGV’s safety in an uncertain environment. Specifically, based on the initial environment information, a global optimal trajectory connecting the start and the destination is predefined by an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA). In the presence of unforeseen obstacles, a trial-based forward search (TFS) algorithm based on the Markov chain is proposed in the local trajectory planning module, while collision prediction is integrated as heuristic information. The vehicle’s current state is updated accordingly for the sake of avoiding entire state spaces involved in the computation. Therefore, the storage efficiency and convergence rate in local path planning are sufficiently enhanced in comparison to dynamic programming. Moreover, command signals can be calculated with the proposed multiconstrained model predictive controller (MMPC), ensuring the vehicle to track the reference trajectory and smoothen the motion. Finally, the results in both simulations and experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. Note to Practitioners —This article is motivated by the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) collision avoidance problem in practical missions, such as farming and emergency response. In recent years, various trajectory planning and tracking algorithms have been widely developed. However, the environmental complexity and the intruders’ unexpected movement pose difficulties in trajectory planning, especially in ensuring the computation time under the allowable threshold. Moreover, the UGV practical trajectory tracking is a challenging task which demands a desired response within various physical constraints. In this article, a two-stage conflict resolution system is proposed. Fi...

9326720,Observer-Based Prescribed Performance Adaptive Terminal Sliding Mode Control for Path Tracking of Autonomous Ground Vehicles,"This paper investigates the path tracking control problem of the autonomous ground vehicles with the prescribed performance in the presence of the system uncertainties. An observer-based prescribed performance adaptive terminal sliding mode controller is developed. Firstly, considering the parameter uncertainties and unknown external disturbances, the vehicle kinematics model and the 2-DOF vehicle dynamics model are established. Then, a novel finite-time extended state observer is first designed to observe the unmeasured states and the lumped disturbances of the lateral motion control system simultaneously, which can achieve finite-time convergence of the estimated errors. On this basis, to further improve the transient and steady-state performance of the path tracking of the autonomous ground vehicles, a robust path tracking controller is presented based on the adaptive fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode control and the prescribed performance control. It is demonstrated that the path tracking errors can reach the origin in finite time and have the predefined maximum overshoots and steady-state errors. The joint simulation results of MATLAB and CarSim show that the newly proposed control algorithm can realize the precise path tracking control of the autonomous ground vehicles, keep the tracking errors within the prescribed bounds, and has strong robustness."
9500318,Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicle Movements in Wireless Sensor Networks,"In this work we use autonomous vehicles to improve the performance of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In contrast to other autonomous vehicle applications, WSNs have two metrics for performance evaluation. First, quality of information (QoI) which is used to measure the quality of sensed data (e.g., measurement uncertainties or signal strength). Second, quality of service (QoS) which is used to measure the network’s performance for data forwarding (e.g., delay and packet losses). As a use case, we consider wireless acoustic sensor networks, where a group of speakers move inside a room and there are autonomous vehicles installed with microphones for streaming the audio data. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision problem (MDP) and solve it using Deep-Q-Networks (DQN). Additionally, we compare the performance of DQN solution to two different real-world implementations: speakers holding/passing microphones and microphones being preinstalled in fixed positions.We show using simulations that the performance of autonomous vehicles in terms of QoI and QoS is better than the real-world implementation in some scenarios. Moreover, we study the impact of the vehicles speed on the learning process of the DQN solution and show how low speeds degrade the performance. Finally, we compare the DQN solution to a heuristic one and provide theoretical analysis of the performance with respect to dynamic WSNs."
9267916,Low-speed and Low-Altitude AUV Control,"Global demand for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is projected to increase by 37% between 2018 and 2022. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for AUV capable of autonomous underwater operations, exploration, and special missions. One of the important operations is autonomous activities near the seabed. In order to achieve such an activity, it is necessary to develop a technology that can stably control the AUV motion even when it approaches the seabed at low speed. In this paper, three techniques for AUV control at low speed and low altitude are described: a seabed surface estimation method using an acoustic sensor, a target trajectory generation method considering vehicle motion characteristics, and a cooperative motion control method using thrusters and rudders."
9251068,AV-FUZZER: Finding Safety Violations in Autonomous Driving Systems,"This paper proposes AV-FUZZER, a testing framework, to find the safety violations of an autonomous vehicle (AV) in the presence of an evolving traffic environment. We perturb the driving maneuvers of traffic participants to create situations in which an AV can run into safety violations. To optimally search for the perturbations to be introduced, we leverage domain knowledge of vehicle dynamics and genetic algorithm to minimize the safety potential of an AV over its projected trajectory. The values of the perturbation determined by this process provide parameters that define participants' trajectories. To improve the efficiency of the search, we design a local fuzzer that increases the exploitation of local optima in the areas where highly likely safety-hazardous situations are observed. By repeating the optimization with significantly different starting points in the search space, AV-FUZZER determines several diverse AV safety violations. We demonstrate AV-FUZZER on an industrial-grade AV platform, Baidu Apollo, and find five distinct types of safety violations in a short period of time. In comparison, other existing techniques can find at most two. We analyze the safety violations found in Apollo and discuss their overarching causes."
8952506,Sampling Rate Selection for Trajectory Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles,"Trajectory tracking is a basic yet highly important function for autonomous driving, and its performance differs with different sampling rates. That is, the performance usually improves at the expense of high computer cost, and reducing the sampling rate may drive the system to instability. In this paper, the influence of different sampling rates for autonomous vehicle control is discussed and a sampling rate design method is proposed. Firstly, a 2-DOF linear vehicle bicycle model with a preview model for trajectory tracking is introduced. With the combined model, a certain bandwidth expression is derived from the model transfer function, which is then utilized to deduce the range of possible sampling rates. Impacts of sampling rate on tracking performance is demonstrated by both simulations and experiments."
9071897,Path tracking of an autonomous vehicle by means of an indirect adaptive neural controller,"Due to nonlinearity of the dynamic models and the advantages of neural networks, we design an indirect adaptive neural controller for tracking the path of an autonomous vehicle. Our proposed algorithm, which includes a neural identifier, controls the lateral movement of the autonomous car. The updating laws for the identifying neural network and the controlling neural network are obtained by means of the gradient descent method. The identifying neural network is employed to estimate the Jacobian of the vehicle's lateral movement, which is then used for updating the parameters of the adaptive neural controller online. In this paper, both the radial basis function (RBF) and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) types of indirect adaptive neural controllers have been deigned. The simulation results corroborate the satisfactory performance of our proposed method in controlling the lateral motion of the examined autonomous vehicle. The results of RBF and MLP indirect adaptive neural controllers have also been compared in this work."
9602874,Q-learning based Tracking Control and Slope Climbing Strategy Design of Autonomous Mobile Robot and Flatbed Vehicle,"Thanks to advances in technology, the forth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is coming. All the manufacturers are undertaking large-scale technological innovations which include artificial intelligence and auto guided vehicle. These two research fields are also the major techniques in the proposed paper. In this paper, the tracking control and slope-climbing strategy between autonomous mobile robot and flatbed vehicle is proposed. The structure is integrated by three parts. First, the Q-learning algorithm is applied to controller design. Second, LIDAR sensor and camera are used to measure distance, forward direction and position of flatbed vehicle relative to autonomous mobile robot. Third, Robot Operation System (ROS) is adopt to be the data communication system among central processor unit, LIDAR sensor and camera of the autonomous mobile robot. In the simulation results, the flatbed vehicle follows three different trajectories, and the autonomous mobile robot computes tracking paths by machine vision and Q-learning algorithm. After reaching a certain distance, the autonomous mobile robot would carry out slope-climbing strategy to link with flatbed vehicle successfully."
8986626,Design and Experiments of Safeguard Protected Preview Lane Keeping Control for Autonomous Vehicles,"Lane keeping control needs to achieve smooth steering operation while ensuring safety-no lane departures and maintain small lateral displacement. In this paper, we solve this challenge by developing a preview lane keeping control supervised by a safeguard controller. The preview control utilizes both tracking errors and future lane curvatures to generate the optimal steering commands. The safeguard controller is then designed to guarantee bounded tracking errors. It supervises the preview control and intervenes if and only if the tracking error is approaching the safety boundary. Both algorithms have analytical control laws and thus require little on-line computations. The integrated system is compared with a model predictive control (MPC) design in terms of both tracking performance and computing efficiency. We implemented the proposed controls on a self-driving vehicle platform and tested on open roads and in the Mcity test facility."
9535165,Assessing Alternative Approaches for Conveying Automated Vehicle “Intentions”,"Research suggests the general public has inherent distrust in highly automated vehicles (HAV), typically stemming from a lack of vehicle system transparency while in motion (e.g., the user not being informed how the car will react in the upcoming scene) and not having an effective way to control the vehicle in the event of a system failure. To better understand user trust and perceptions of comfort and safety while riding in an HAV, this study evaluated in-situ human-machine interface (HMI) systems (visual, auditory, and mixed-modal) to relay vehicle “intentions” (e.g., the vehicle's response to roadway stimuli) to the user. A considerable link was found between HMI modality and users’ reported levels of comfort, safety, and trust during experimentation. In addition, several key behavioral traits are identified as factors that contributed to users’ baseline comfort levels with the HAV. Moving forward, it will be necessary for HAV systems to keep users in-the-loop in an effort to increase system transparency and overall understanding. Vehicle feedback should consistently and accurately represent the driving landscape and clearly communicate vehicle system state to users."
8806106,Waveform Design for UAV Payload Communication in C-band,"Currently, LTE mobile communication technology is considered as the main communication link of UAV. However, an auxiliary communication link is indispensable for stable operation and mission execution of UAV even in areas where existing mobile communication networks can not cover. For stable operation of UAV, auxiliary communication link requires greater communication coverage and link availability than existing LTE mobile communication network. In that sense, it is difficult to use for the auxiliary communication link unlicensed band where there is the small power limitation and severe interference is suffered. Therefore, C-bands, which is allocated for UAV control and payload communication, could be good candidate. In this paper, we propose a new waveform for UAV payload communication in the C-band and show its performance results."

The test results obtained on a closed test track prove the usefulness of the presented methodology. The resulting algorithm and experiences collected during implementation could be useful for integration into a larger system."
8805437,Cognitive Risk Control for Anti-Jamming V2V Communications in Autonomous Vehicle Networks,"The future of intelligent transportation system (ITS) is expected to be composed of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the development of which will have great impact on people's everyday life. Unfortunately, this progress will be accompanied by all kinds of potential threats and attacks rising in CAV network. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, we investigate the anti-jamming V2V communication in CAV networks through power control in conjunction with channel selection. Bringing into play a brain-inspired research tool called cognitive dynamic system (CDS), the general structure of cognitive risk control (CRC) is well-tailored to analyze and address the jamming problem. Specifically, power control is carried out first using reinforcement learning, the result of which is then examined by a module called task-switch control. Based on the risk assessment, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is formulated to perform the channel-selection process when necessary. Through continuous perception-action cycles (PACs), the feature of predictive adaptation is realized for the legitimate vehicle in its behavioral interactions with the jammer. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has desirable performance in terms of several evaluation metrics."
8813790,Semantic Grid-Based Road Model Estimation for Autonomous Driving,"For autonomous driving, knowledge about the current environment and especially the driveable lanes is of utmost importance. Currently this information is often extracted from meticulously (hand-)crafted offline high-definition maps, restricting the operation of autonomous vehicles to few well-mapped areas and making it vulnerable to temporary or permanent environment changes. This paper addresses the issues of map-based road models by building the road model solely from online sensor measurements. Based on Dempster-Shafer theory and a novel frame of discernment, sensor measurements, such as lane markings, semantic segmentation of drivable and non-drivable areas and the trajectories of other observed traffic participants are fused into semantic grids. Geometrical lane information is extracted from these grids via an iterative path-planning method. The proposed approach is evaluated on real measurement data from German highways and urban areas."
9250499,A Lightweight Simulation Framework for Learning Control Policies for Autonomous Vehicles in Real-World Traffic Condition,"We present a new simulation framework for learning control policies for autonomous vehicles (AVs) based on real-world vehicle data and maps. The framework we propose consists of three major components: a) creating a detailed lane-level map (i.e., a high definition (HD) map) for a region of interest, b) generating an environment on the HD-map using the sensor outputs (e.g., GPS, radar) from vehicles driving in the same region, and c) learning a control policy based on the realistic environment constructed. We created the lane-level HD-maps using open street maps (OSM) and aerial imagery, from which we extracted the lane-level marking and edge features. The extracted image features are then utilized to calculate higher level attributes (e.g., curvature, heading, cross-sections etc.) for each point in the HD-map. The data acquired from vehicle sensors is combined with the constructed map to create a realistic environment. Based on the constructed environment, we learned a policy to control the vehicle laterally using a reinforcement learning algorithm and longitudinally using proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework works well, offering a flexible and scalable solution for learning control policies for AVs in realistic environments."
9307432,Bringing Trust to Autonomous Mobility,"Last decade has been characterized by a huge advancement in the field of automated and connected transport. However, fully autonomous systems still need a lot of effort in order to be applied in transportation. Meanwhile, mixed traffic environments with semi-autonomous vehicles is becoming a norm. In such conditions, vehicles are passing the dynamic driving task back to the human by sending to drivers Requests to Intervene (RtI). At the same time, there is a need to evolve driver's training in order to be able to safely use semi-automated vehicles, whereas driver intervention performance has to be made an integral part of both driver and technology assessment. Furthermore, the ethical implications of automated decision-making need to be properly assessed, giving rise to novel risk and liability analysis models. In this conceptual paper we present our vision to maximise the safety, trust and acceptance of automated vehicles. To achieve that, we propose an assessment framework to evaluate different technologies involved in Automated Driving Systems (ADS)."
9110550,Design of Line-of-Sight Guidance Law and a Constrained Optimal Controller for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,"A line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law with an explicit model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The derived LOS law is based on quaternion angles thus avoids the problem of singularity inherited in Euler angles. The proposed guidance and control scheme is computationally inexpensive and generates a robust optimal control signal for AUV dynamics. In view of the practical implementation, the constraints on control planes and parametric uncertainties are taken into consideration while designing the proposed control law. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by both simulation and experimentation using a prototype AUV developed in the laboratory. Subsequently, multiple experiments were conducted to ascertain the applicability of the proposed algorithm in a practical scenario."
9158643,Background Flow Sensing for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Using Model Reduction with Dynamic Mode Decomposition,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have received increasing attention among scientific and engineering societies for their superior performances and promising future in marine environments. A key challenge to marine autonomy is the sensing of the background flow environment, which is important for navigation and motion control of AUVs. While existing flow estimation studies typically focus on (quasi-)steady flow fields for AUVs of well-defined shapes, this paper proposes a novel flow sensing algorithm that applies to any dynamic flows for arbitrary AUV shapes. The proposed flow sensing method assimilates distributed pressure measurements through coalescing recursive Bayesian estimation and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based model reduction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed flow sensing algorithm, both simulation and experimental results are presented on three testing prototypes of different shapes including a Joukowski foil, a triangle, and a rectangle."
8640838,Trajectory Tracking Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle With Unknown Parameters and External Disturbances,"Most studies so far on trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) have assumed that the Euler angles are exactly known. However, the AUV inevitably suffers from external environmental disturbances which are driven by wind, density, and temperature gradients. The attitude transducers cannot derive accurate attitude information of the AUV. Additionally, the uncertain hydrodynamic parameters affect the stability of the system. Consequently, it is unknown whether tracking performance of the AUV can be guaranteed. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, a finite-time controller is developed by using the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control technique. A robust differentiator is proposed to estimate the external disturbances and uncertain parts. Simulations are performed to show that with the proposed control laws, the AUV converges to the desired trajectory even in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainty."
9382881,Design and Optimization of Robust Path Tracking Control for Autonomous Vehicles with Fuzzy Uncertainty,"Uncertainty is a major concern in vehicle path tracking control design. The coefficients of the uncertainty bound are unknown. They are assumed to lie within prescribed fuzzy sets. First, based on the path tracking kinematic model, this paper innovatively formulates the vehicle path tracking task as a constraint-following problem. Second, we put forward a deterministic adaptive robust control law with a tunable parameter to ensure the uniform boundedness and ultimate uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system. Third, an optimal scheme for the tunable parameter is proposed based on the fuzzy uncertainty. The resulting optimal robust control (ORC) minimizes a comprehensive fuzzy performance index that involves the fuzzy system performance and the control cost. The results of the CarSim-Simulink co-simulation and the Hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment together show that the proposed optimal robust control exhibits a superior path tracking performance."
9144916,"Data Fusion in Autonomous Vehicles Research, Literature Tracing from Imaginary Idea to Smart Surrounding Community","Many significant challenges related to transportation systems have been raised recently, these include the high accidents rate, road congestion, emission of gases, and environment pollution. Furthermore, transportation crashes caused injuries in accident. Researchers investigated virtual methodologies to automate the transportation process that known as Intelligent Transport System (ITS).

9385629,Autonomous vehicle navigation based in a hybrid methodology: model based and machine learning based,"For decades researchers have attempted to make the car drives autonomously. One of the challenges of developing this kind of system is the environment detection and understanding where the car is supposed to drive, and control the vehicle on a safe way, based upon on the perception of the environment, provided by on-boarded sensors (cameras, LIDAR). The existing navigation methods applied to solve this problem can be organized in two categories: those based on “geometrical or physical models” and those based upon on “machine learning models”. Machine Learning based models can have good performance when trained appropriately, however, due to its “black-box” characteristics (lack of physical meaning), it can return non accurate output or even wrong values in unseen situations, leading the vehicle to collision. In the other hand, Geometric or physical approaches are designed under certain approximately modeling assumptions, based on physical/geometrical parameters that are uncertain or can not be identified, and becomes a painstaking work as it gets more complex. This paper presents a hybrid autonomous navigation methodology, which takes advantage of the learning capability of Machine Learning (ML) models, and uses the safeness of the Dynamic Window Approach geometric method. Using a single camera and a 2D LIDAR sensor, the proposed method actuates as a high level controller, finding optimal vehicle velocities to be applied by a low level controller. The system algorithm is validated on CARLA Simulator environment, where a vehicle coupled by this system proved to be capable of achieving the following tasks: Lane keeping and obstacle avoidance."

9208311,Intelligent Performance Analysis of Automated Steering Systems for Autonomous Vehicles,"Intelligent ground vehicles require automated steering control systems. The complexity of the automated steering systems has increased as the concurrent data receiving, processing, decision-making and monitoring all happen simultaneously in super-fast sampling rates. The research reported in this paper focuses on the neural network training and machine learning approach for an automated steering system. The essential information of the steering controller was trained using artificial neural network (ANN) and pattern recognition algorithm approaches. The objective is to investigate the design of ANN training and deep machine learning on collected data from sensors of steering wheel angular position, speed, steering column torque, and ego vehicle speed and generating acceptable steering commands for the vehicle. The results of the research showed that the proposed network control system had trained and validated more than 96.5% steering system behavior patterns and adapted large random disturbances of the steering controller commands. It is, therefore, necessary to develop artificial intelligence methodologies in automated steering systems of autonomous vehicles with neural network representing the main topology blocks of the control system architecture and utilize ANN abstraction in the control system of autonomous vehicle steering control system."
9129666,Performance Evaluation of Data Dissemination Protocols for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"An overwhelmed number of vehicles has wrecked the current system of transportation due to rapid growth in population. Smart cities are the novel innovation that is inevitable to curb the problems of traffic jams, unorganized traffic, environmental pollution, and slow response rate to emergency situations. The intelligent transportation system (ITS) is an integral part of smart cities allowing communications and interaction among vehicles. An autonomous vehicle is the key element of ITS and the mass implementation of this emerging technology is the solution to traffic problems linked to the current transportation system. Autonomous vehicles lead to the need for efficient and reliable external vehicular communications particularly through vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET). However, utilizing a suitable routing protocol to provide stable routing and efficient performance for vehicular communications in autonomous vehicles is a key factor. Routing protocols are particularly important for establishing vehicular to vehicular and vehicular to infrastructure (V2X) communication, which is incredibly challenging due to the movement of nodes. The quality of inter-vehicular communications is widely affected by numerous factors such as routing protocols, traffic environment, and traffic density. This article presents a detailed evaluation of three commonly used protocols, i.e., Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), and Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) under three different traffic environments. To investigate the performance of these routing protocols under diverse environments, simulations are extended further by using the varying density of vehicles. This study aims at finding the best routing protocol for efficient and reliable packet dissemination among vehicles under different scenarios."

Through AV technology, it can greatly save labor costs and improve transportation efficiency. Vehicle platooning is a technology that can further enhance the advantages of AV, which enables one driver to drive many vehicles at the same time. However, how to format the whole platoon and control the motion of each vehicle is still challenging because of the complexity of the real-world environment. This paper proposes a hybrid control method by combining PID and model predictive control for a robust vehicle platooning with communication failure, physical constraints and computation cost considered."

At the same time, the ultra-low latency, the increased bandwidth, and the softwarization and virtualization technologies of 5G systems are opening the door to multiple applications in the context of connected and automated vehicles. The deployment of applications at the edge of the mobile network under the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm becomes an excellent option for meeting the latency requirements imposed by connected mobility. In this context, this demonstration showcases how remote and autonomous driving applications, such as lane tracking and object detection, can be offloaded to a MEC-enabled 5G network without impairing their effectiveness, and the change in the latency perceived by end-users with respect to a cloud deployment."
9237608,Coordination Control of Path Tracking and Stability for 4WS Autonomous Vehicle,"Path tracking and stability are two main considerations in autonomous vehicle control design. Compared with traditional front wheel steering, 4WS (four wheel steering) has better stability in high-speed steering, but the intervention of rear wheel steering will reduce the performance of vehicle's path tracking. In this paper, the linear quadratic optimal control theory is used to design a front and rear wheel coordinated control method for the path tracking problem of active 4WS autonomous vehicle, which can improve the lateral stability of the vehicle and have a better path tracking ability. First of all, 2-DOF vehicle dynamics model and optimal preview path tracking model are established and combined, then different weighting functions are selected for the front and rear wheels to optimize the vehicle state. In the environment of MATLAB / CarSim, the simulation of the high-speed double shift line condition is carried out. The results show that the proposed control strategy, compared with the classical proportional control four-wheel steering vehicle, improves accuracy of path tracking, reduces the lateral speed and acceleration, and improves lateral stability of the vehicle."

An optimal control model is established to control the movement of CAVs, aiming at reducing fuel consumption and improve passengers' ride comfort. Besides, the car-following behavior of HDVs is modeled by the intelligent driver model (IDM). Finally, we conduct simulation tests to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model in the mixed platoon. Numerical simulations show that this cooperation control method between CAVs and HDVs can smooth out the trajectory and improve the driving comfort."
8926794,Development of an Open-source Educational and Research Platform for Autonomous Cars,"Technological innovation in recent years is called “The Fourth Industrial Revolution.” As a typical example, the development of autonomous driving is thriving in the world. However, if cars are automated, there is a problem that it is necessary to secure people who can technically deal with autonomous cars in order for us to coexist fully with the autonomous cars. Furthermore, in Japan, it is difficult to provide the cars continuingly, because the shortage of IT personnel is a serious problem. In this study, the authors developed a hardware platform for research and education usage to assist autonomous driving technologies. The platform is a one-tenth size model car that mainly consists of ordinary consumer electronics such as Raspberry Pi and is also an open source. It is not only affordable but also easy-to-modify by everyone. Therefore, the hurdles to learn autonomous driving technologies are very low. In addition, the platform isn't a general robot like LEGO MINDSTORMS, because it is a model very similar to a car and is a robot specialized in autonomous driving technologies. We made three experiments to verify functions of sensors and actuators attached to the model car. As the results, we confirmed that the car can be used as the platform without any big errors."
9406805,Autonomous Vehicles Scenario Testing Framework and Model of Computation: On Generation and Coverage,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology started to shift the perception of the transportation systems. However, for AVs to operate at their optimum capabilities, they need to go through a comprehensive testing and verification process. While a large amount of research and funding has been provided for solving this problem, there is still a lack of a systematic method to develop standardized tests that can be used to judge if the decision-making capability functions are within acceptable parameters. To that end, the tests need to cover all possible situations that an AV may run into. This paper focuses on defining the notion of coverage mathematically when using pseudo-randomly generated simulations for testing. The approach defines new equivalence relations between scenes, which are the systems’ various states, to achieve this goal. Considering the substantial need for computation, even with the obtained coverage, we also introduce the mathematical definition of a sub-scene and additional strategies, such as expanding the equivalence classes of scenes and combining actors in scenes, to reduce the amount of testing required to certify AVs."
9453818,Model Predictive Control Method for Autonomous Vehicles Using Time-Varying and Non-Uniformly Spaced Horizon,"This paper proposes an algorithm for path-following and collision avoidance of an autonomous vehicle based on model predictive control (MPC) using time-varying and non-uniformly spaced horizon. The MPC based on non-uniformly spaced horizon approach uses the time intervals that are small for the near future, and time intervals that are large for the distant future, to extend the length of the whole prediction horizon with a fixed number of prediction steps. This MPC has the advantage of being able to detect obstacles in advance because it can see the distant future. However, the presence of longer time interval samples may lead to poor path-following performance, especially for paths with high curvature. The proposed algorithm performs proper adjustment of the prediction interval according to a given situation. For sections with large curvature, it uses the short prediction intervals to increase the path-following performance; further, to consider obstacles over a wider range, it uses the long prediction intervals. This technique allows simultaneous improvement of the path-following performance and the range of obstacle avoidance with fixed computational complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through an open-source simulator, CARLA and real-time experiments."
8832695,Lidar-IMU and Wheel Odometer Based Autonomous Vehicle Localization System,"Localization is a critical issue in autonomous navigation and path planning. The traditional localization method for automatic driving is to use the GPS. But in many cases, such as near the high buildings, under the viaduct, in the basement or the tunnel, GPS signal will disappeared or be weakened, resulting in localization failure. This paper proposed a precise localization method based on Lidar, IMU and wheel odometer combined with point cloud data map matching. In this paper, information in the form of depth point cloud collected by Lidar is matched with the pre-known point cloud map data, and a Point-to-Plane Iterative Closest Point algorithm (PP-ICP) is introduced. In order to avoid the mismatch and localization failure, the start of the autonomous vehicle is set to the initial coordinates of the point cloud map data. Then, the predicted state equation which consists of the throttle control and steering wheel control of the autonomous vehicle is established. The first observation equation consists of the acceleration and angular velocity measured by the IMU. The second observation equation consists of the position and attitude measured by the Lidar matching point cloud, along with speed and distance measured by the wheel odometer. Finally, the extended Kalman filter is used to fuse the information data of the three sensors and thus update and correct the localization. Experiments using multi-sensor fusion were carried out in underground garages and the experimental results showed that the robustness and positioning accuracy can meet the engineering requirements."
8942308,The Role of Virtual Reality in Autonomous Vehicles’ Safety,"Virtual Reality (VR) has played an important role in the development of autonomous robots. From Computer Aided Design (CAD) to simulators for testing automation algorithms without risking expensive equipment, VR has been used in a wide range of applications. Most recently, Autonomous Vehicles (AV), a special application of autonomous robots, became a major focus of the scientific and practitioner community for road and vehicle safety improvements. However, recent AV accidents shed a light on the new safety challenges that need be addressed to fulfill those safety expectations. This paper presents a systematic literature mapping on the use of VR for AV safety and assimilates this literature to create a vision of how VR will play an important role in the development of safety in AV."
9239913,Dimensionless Model-Based System Tracking Via Augmented Kalman Filter for Multiscale Unmanned Ground Vehicles,"In recent years, many unmanned vehicle designs and autonomous driving functions have been introduced in the automotive industry to increase the safety and versatility of multiple vehicle designs. It is critical to select a plant vehicle model and a compact uncertainty representation regardless of the vehicle scale for vast deployment. This article introduces a dimensionless representation of a dynamic vehicle model that is suitable for generalized dynamic analysis. Demonstrations included in this article showed that the compact uncertainty bounds of the dimensionless parameters could be used to generate an adaptive observer suitable for full-sized and corresponding scaled vehicles. The proposed dimensionless model-based observer can assess motion states, mass, center of gravity displacement, and the tire stiffness online with common onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU). The effectiveness and sensitivity of the proposed technique are highlighted through simulations and experiments on scaled test vehicles."
9304625,"A Modular Architecture for Procedural Generation of Towns, Intersections and Scenarios for Testing Autonomous Vehicles","Simulation-based testing is critical for ensuring safety of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are enabled by deep learning techniques which require a large quantity of data. With simulation testing, we can create rare events for testing and training of autonomous vehicles. Procedural generation of roads and modeling of driving behaviors in an easily extendable architecture ensures that we are able to create rare scenarios at scale with minimal artistic burden. In this paper, we present CruzWay, a system that both supports and creates these scenarios. With CruzWay, we are able to procedurally generate town sized road networks or road intersections. CruzWay supports generation of road meshes as well as navigation meshes from SUMO road network files. CruzWay can generate cars as well as pedestrians run by behavior trees (BTs) in this environment. The self-contained, modular nature of BTs in combination with procedural roads allows us to create a large number of scenarios."
9398321,Ergonomic Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles - An investigation on the effect of transition curves on Handling Behaviour,"As vehicles transcend into higher levels of automation, a key factor that will determine a comfortable driving experience for the passengers will be the handling behaviour of the autonomous vehicles. Path planning will serve an important role in ensuring smooth and comfortable handling. The present study develops a well defined universal scale to define the handling behaviour of autonomous vehicles using different ergonomic path planning tools. Firstly, a reference track is designed to incorporate the worst handling. Followed by designing ergonomic roads using transition curves such as B-spline, Bezier and Hermite curves to investigate the impact of these curves on handling behaviour. Trajectory tracking of an 8 degree of freedom vehicle model is then studied using curvature dependent and curvature independent controllers to draw a comparison. Results are then compared and evaluated using a universal cost function to determine the optimal transition curve for handling. Results indicate that 3-point defined curves in general perform better handling with B-spline evaluated as the best handling transition curve for 4-point defined curves. Further research is recommended by utilising key characteristics of the transition curves like local control and non-uniformity."
9483718,Comparison of Connected Automated Vehicle to Pedestrian Interaction Systems to Reduce Vehicle Waiting Times,"As autonomous vehicle technology starts to become more common in daily life, a degree of uncertainty arises with respect to pedestrian safety. As the technology gets more and more advanced, there becomes greater possibility for lapses in connectivity and miscommunications between pedestrians and vehicles. Hence, it is important that society finds the best way for pedestrians to interact with all types of vehicles in order to keep them safe, in the midst of a continuous increase in pedestrian incidents. Thusly, the focus of this investigation is to determine the feasibility of crossing intersections reliant on pedestrian to vehicle connectivity. As vehicles increase in complexity with respect to their interaction with other vehicles, pedestrians, and the environment, intersections may not require physical infrastructure - autonomous vehicles may be built to recognize pedestrians and to stop accordingly, and signal timing may be periodically uploaded in the form of continuously changing datasets. Such intersections have ambiguous effects on pedestrian and vehicle interactions, partially due to the uncertainty of afore-mentioned connectivity dynamics. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely primarily on obstacle detection systems, a main connectivity dynamic between pedestrians and vehicles, to tell them to stop for pedestrians. These systems, many still deep in the development phase, may be flawed. This paper describes an experiment developed with the intention of comparing a traditional obstacle detection approach to pedestrian crossing with one in which vehicles stop based on pedestrians notifying them of their presence. More specifically, in order to cross, pedestrians must ""signal"" to vehicles that they are in the crossing area (in the real world, this could be done on a mobile phone) so that the vehicles will stop for them. The model, developed using Simio, outputs queue timing and density values for the vehicles and pedestrians. Data was gathered related t...

8675666,Probabilistic Interaction-Aware Occupancy Prediction for Vehicles in Arbitrary Road Scenes,"This paper drafts a new interaction-aware approach to predict road user occupancy through vehicle-specific probabilities of presence. Instead of presenting another behavior prediction approach which tries to predict the most likely vehicle positions, the aim is to determine the likelihood of all feasible vehicle positions, called probability of presence. Thus the occupied area derived from this probability of presence blocks less space compared to existing approaches in the field of occupancy prediction. For this purpose, based on a physical model the future presence areas of a vehicle are fully calculated in a discrete consideration. Each movement possibility is evaluated taking into account the statistically typical driver behavior and interactions with static and dynamic objects. This gives rise to a qualified prediction of the future behavior of vehicles which blocks less space compared to all feasible future vehicle positions, like demonstrated in the numerical example."
8814151,A Novel Robust Lane Change Trajectory Planning Method for Autonomous Vehicle,"A novel trajectory planning method is proposed in this paper for lane change of autonomous vehicle. Since it is difficult to accurately capture the trajectory of other vehicles, which means the trajectory for autonomous vehicle couldn't always easy to generate quickly. Moreover, the motion planning, as a kind of high-dimensional optimization problem with multiple nonlinear constraints, requires lots of resources to find a right solution. Therefore, we present a trajectory monitoring strategy to keep robust in lane change scenario, which generates the lane change and monitoring trajectory at the same time. If the former does not produce a safe trajectory or is time out, the monitoring trajectory will be taken as the result output. To meet the constraints of vehicle's motion and real-time requirements, B-spline-based method will be employed to plan a continuous curvature path. And RRT-based method works as a supplement for keeping algorithm completeness. Then the monitory trajectory mainly obeys collision-free requirements, which computes deceleration that keeps vehicle stability. The results illustrate that both B-spline-based method and RRT-based could generate curvature continuous and meet the limitation for motion, however, both have the possibility of timeout. Especially, there are challenge to the success rate as environment becomes more complex."
8992978,Optimized IoT Based Decision Making For Autonomous Vehicles In Intersections,"Applications that use communication networks and distributed systems to control traffic have high latency, especially in critical situations. The performance of these applications largely depends on the computational delay of algorithms that run on local or central processors. Therefore, providing an optimized solution to minimize this delay to a tolerable range is highly needed. This article studies a method in which autonomous vehicles around an intersection try to control the intersection traffic efficiently by communicating and interacting with each other and road-side smart devices. This problem can be addressed in the form of a network utility maximization problem. To achieve a solution that is close to an optimal solution, a gradient descent algorithm with a fixed step size can be utilized. It is necessary to find a balance between latency and accuracy, which leads to finding a velocity close to the optimal velocity. The number of loop repetitions in the scheduling algorithm, determines the latency in preparation for making the proper schedule for autonomous vehicles. In this work, we propose an approach to provide an optimized schedule for autonomous vehicles in intersections considering pedestrian traffic. Autonomous vehicles are able to communicate with each other and road side unites. However, surveillance cameras are required to observe pedestrians passing the intersection. Hence, we utilize cameras, smart sensors, processors, and communication equipment embedded in autonomous vehicles and road side unites, to collect the required data, process it, and distribute the calculated optimal decision to autonomous vehicles. To simulate the traffic behaviors resulting from applying the proposed solution, Simulation of Urban Mobility software is used."
9392784,Digital Twin Analysis to Promote Safety and Security in Autonomous Vehicles,"With the new industrial revolution of digital transformation, more intelligence and autonomous systems can be adopted in the manufacturing transportation processes. Safety and security of autonomous vehicles (AVs) have obvious advantages of reducing accidents and maintaining a cautious environment for drivers and pedestrians. Therefore, the transformation to data-driven vehicles is associated with the concept of digital twin, especially within the context of AV design. This also raises the need to adopt new safety designs to increase the resiliency and security of the whole AV system. To enable secure autonomous systems for smart manufacturing transportation in an end-to-end fashion, this article presents the main challenges and solutions considering safety and security functions. This article aims to identify a standard framework for vehicular digital twins that facilitate the data collection, data processing, and analytics phases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study for a vehicle follower model is analyzed when radar sensor measurements are manipulated in an attempt to cause a collision. Perceptive findings of this article can pave the way for future research aspects related to employing digital twins in the AV industry."
9594425,Indoor Autonomous Powerline Inspection Model,"This paper presents the development of an autonomous system that leverages the Quanser Qdrone to perform above-ground indoor autonomous powerline inspections. The powerline infrastructure is exposed to various extreme weather conditions that create an operational concern for utility companies. Frequent inspections ensure the safe operation of a power transmission grid. There are mainly two methods of examination, ground and air [1]. The ground inspections are often slow and challenging due to the rough terrain, utility pole height, and inaccessible remote areas. The aerial inspections are accomplished by deploying helicopters that are expensive to operate, maintain, and repair. As an alternative, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being widely adopted for both surveillance and analysis throughout the energy and utility industries. UAVs are being used for inspections of utility towers as well as powerlines as they are energy efficient, user friendly, and convenient. Drone video capturing allows for safer, faster, and more cost-effective solutions to powerline and utility tower inspections as the user does not have to leave the ground aside from repairs. The objective of this project was to develop an autonomous UAV system to detect and track powerlines and utility poles to perform fault inspections of their electrical and material components. The proposed algorithm used a state flow machine paired with an image recognition neural network to make decisions for searching, identifying, and flying along utility poles and powerlines. The proposed system was implemented using MathWorks MATLAB and Simulink with Quarc, a third-party toolbox designed by Quanser, enabling real-time applications with the QDrone. The project yielded an algorithm that would autonomously fly the Quanser QDrone through a scan of the local area, leverage a neural network, PowerNet, to locate an initial tower within the work area, follow attached powerlines if there are any, and locate the secondary...

9564467,Environmental Data Collection as a Byproduct for Autonomous Ride-Hailing Services,"Shared mobility systems such as ride-hailing services transform urban mobility and have the potential to increase the efficiency of road transport. In this paper, we examine the possibility to establish the collection and daily updating of highly dynamic environmental data as a side-business for autonomous ride-hailing companies. We suggest a rebalancing heuristic that lets the vehicles drive through as many roads of the city as possible to collect data without neglecting the ride-hailing customers. To quantify this routing scheme's effects, we perform a case study with 100 vehicles for 24 hours in Hamburg, Germany, based on an on-demand mobility provider's vehicle data. We observe a gain of gathered data of almost 28% while there is a service decline of 1.6% with respect to the number of served customers. If we want to increase the share of daily gathered data to 95% of the road network, we need at least 131 ride-hailing vehicles. The presented rebalancing policy is also transferable to other fleet service operations or regular commuting vehicles like taxis and buses."
8768841,A Simulation Approach of the Internet of Intelligent Vehicles for Closed Routes in Urban Environments,"In recent years, through the evolution of intelligent transport systems (ITS), there has been an increase in components to monitor different variables in the vehicles (such as driver monitoring, tire pressure, oil pressure, vehicle speed, acceleration, among others). Internet of Things (IoT) is enabling the collection of a variety of information of all types of components for monitoring the environment and systems. Also, as part of this evolution, the original concept of Vehicular Ad-hoc networks (VANETs) is being transformed into a new concept, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which involves Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communications, and other variations of these (V2X). In this paper, a review of the state of the art of the technologies and architectures generated around the Internet of the vehicles (IoV) is carried out and with this, an implementation of the simulation of intelligent vehicular communications through the IEEE 802.11p protocol and one of its applications. An algorithm for the generation of vehicular convoys to improve vehicle flow application through V2X communication is proposed and implemented in the simulation, and the communication quality is validated in a closed route in an urban environment during the simulations, omitting aspects of security in communications."
8782784,Smartphone Based HD Map Building for Autonomous Vehicles,"The development of autonomous vehicles requires accurate map information, about the surrounding static landmarks such as lane information. Building up the so called HD Map requires robust sensors, that mainly means special hardware requirements. Thus research in this topic starts with question of availability of an HD Map. This paper describes a method of creating a robust HD Map on highways, including accurate lane information based on a simple smartphone. The sensor data of the phone are filtered by a Kalman-filter. Hence the localization is more accurate during the offline building process and the online recall of lane information as well. Thus based on this lane information, an accurate and robust trajectory can be planned for the autonomous vehicles."
8482503,Dual-Radio Configuration for Flexible Communication in Flocking Micro/Miniature Aerial Vehicles,"This paper presents an overview of a new dual-radio autopilot and ground station platform used in hierarchical, micro aerial vehicle flocks to improve communication flexibility and performance. Flocks of micro/miniature aerial vehicles flying in close proximity are often used in scenarios of hazard detection and tracking. Micro aerial vehicle's small size grants a number of benefits, such as improved maneuverability and reduced cost, but also results in sometimes severe resource constraints. To help alleviate these restrictions, as well as to improve overall communication flexibility, this paper proposes the use of a hierarchical, dual-radio autopilot flock configuration. Interflock communication is facilitated by low-power radios, whereas an elected flock leader relays important communications to a ground station via a long-range, high-power radio. Additionally, the diversity provided by the dual-radio system provides inherent redundancy while improving flock communication adaptability for varying data sizes and transmit distances. An energy efficiency model for this dual-radio configuration is also presented and verified by autonomous, multi-vehicle flight tests."
9170825,End-to-End Probabilistic Ego-Vehicle Localization Framework,"Locating the vehicle in its road is a critical part of any autonomous vehicle system and has been subject to different research topics. In most works presented in the literature, ego-localization is split into three parts: Road level-localization consisting in the road on which the vehicle travels, Lane level localization which is the lane on which the vehicle travels, and Ego lane level localization being the lateral position of the vehicle in the ego-lane. For each part, several researches have been conducted. However, the relationship between the different parts has not been taken into consideration. Through this work, an end-to-end ego-localization framework is introduced with two main novelties. The first one is the proposition of a complete solution that tackles every part of the ego-localization. The second one lies in the information-driven approach used. Indeed, we use prior about the road structure from a digital map in order to reduce the space complexity for the recognition process. Besides, several fusion framework techniques based on Bayesian Network and Hidden Markov Model are elaborated leading to an ego-localization method that is, to a large extent, robust to erroneous sensor data. The robustness of the proposed method is proven on different datasets in varying scenarios."
9108745,Mixed reality test environment for autonomous cars using Unity 3D and SUMO,"Developing a vehicle is always a long and complex task. This is especially true for autonomous cars. Tasks performed by the driver are taken over by the vehicle and must be performed with maximum reliability. Developing these systems is a difficult task, especially due to limited testing capabilities. Testing a vehicle in a closed environment is safe and controlled, but the variety of test scenarios is limited. By using mixed reality environments, one can create a diverse environment around a real test vehicle, with traffic, obstacles, and unexpected situations. The real movement of the test vehicle allows testing decision and motion planning level vehicular functions. Information from the virtual world can be considered as input to the vehicle sensor. Mixed reality or digital twin simulation environments can greatly assist the autonomous vehicle development process and also serve as a basis for validation procedures for such systems. This article introduces a mixed reality simulation environment that integrates a real test vehicle into a virtual environment, can handle other real and virtual obstacles, contains traffic simulations, and visualizes all of these."
9276510,Building Trust in the Untrustable,"Trust is a major aspect in the relationship between humans and autonomous safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles. Although human errors may cause higher risks, failures of autonomous systems are more strongly perceived by the general population, which hinders the adoption of autonomous safety-critical systems. It is therefore necessary to devise approaches for systematically building trust in autonomous functions and thereby facilitate the adoption process. In this paper, we introduce a method and a framework for incrementally building trust in the context of autonomous driving. Within the envisioned solution, we employ the psychological narrative behind trust building through the formation of new habits and introduce a method where trust is established gradually for both the human and the autonomous safety-critical system via reputation building and step-by-step integration of smart software agents replacing human actions."
8795199,Design and Development of Smart Cars Model for Autonomous Vehicles in a Platooning,"The paper presents a new car model prototype design which can be driven in platooning. After each part is tested in real time separately they are then integrated together to obtain the car system prototype and the C++ language is used to program the hardware component system to do its mission. This controls the car behavior which is developed in a real-time operating system as if it can become an autonomous vehicle for navigation purposes capable of avoiding collision as well as keeping a safe distance from the vehicle ahead on the road. The experimental results show the efficiency of this car model we developed. Further, the implementations on each car are made at low-cost, a fact which represents an advantage."
9304697,Lane level context and hidden space characterization for autonomous driving,"For an autonomous vehicle, situation understanding is a key capability towards safe and comfortable decision-making and navigation. Information is in general provided by multiple sources. Prior information about the road topology and traffic laws can be given by a High Definition (HD) map while the perception system provides the description of the space and of road entities evolving in the vehicle surroundings. In complex situations such as those encountered in urban areas, the road user behaviors are governed by strong interactions with the others, and with the road network. In such situations, reliable situation understanding is therefore mandatory to avoid inappropriate decisions. Nevertheless, situation understanding is a complex task that requires access to a consistent and non-misleading representation of the vehicle surroundings. This paper proposes a formalism (an interaction lane grid) which allows to represent, with different levels of abstraction, the navigable and interacting spaces which must be considered for safe navigation. A top-down approach is chosen to assess and characterize the relevant information of the situation. On a high level of abstraction, the identification of the areas of interest where the vehicle should pay attention is depicted. On a lower level, it enables to characterize the spatial information in a unified representation and to infer additional information in occluded areas by reasoning with dynamic objects."

At the same time, the five main behaviors proposed are explained and explained in detail, and simulation experiments are carried out. The simulation experiments result is verified that the proposed behavior-based bionic tracing and positioning method can efficiently complete the plume tracing and positioning task, and has a high success rate."
9130156,Experimenting With Sensors of a Low-Cost Prototype of an Autonomous Vehicle,"Autonomous vehicles are sought to be integral in smart cities. However, should those vehicles be equipped with high-cost sensors? Would the use of low-cost sensors on autonomous vehicles makes them effectively workable over a long period of time? The question of how effective low-cost sensors can be for the proper functionality of autonomous vehicles is addressed in this paper. We have built a small-size prototype of an autonomous vehicle, where low-cost sensors were employed. Then, we have done experimental tests on the vehicle and its sensors, with the features of object detection and response through collision avoidance, traffic lights detection and adequate response, lane detection and lane-keeping response, and end of route detection and stopping response. Our experimental results show that low-cost sensors perform well with carefully-prepared road conditions, but they can be a challenge for operation on real-world roads. Based on our testing experience and on the faced challenges, we share our findings as well as our recommendations with the research community. Therefore, this paper provides insights toward reliable and workable real-world low-cost autonomous vehicles."
8594674,Multi Pseudo Q-Learning-Based Deterministic Policy Gradient for Tracking Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"This paper investigates trajectory tracking problem for a class of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with unknown dynamics and constrained inputs. Different from existing policy gradient methods which employ single actor critic but cannot realize satisfactory tracking control accuracy and stable learning, our proposed algorithm can achieve high-level tracking control accuracy of AUVs and stable learning by applying a hybrid actors-critics architecture, where multiple actors and critics are trained to learn a deterministic policy and action-value function, respectively. Specifically, for the critics, the expected absolute Bellman error-based updating rule is used to choose the worst critic to be updated in each time step. Subsequently, to calculate the loss function with more accurate target value for the chosen critic, Pseudo Q-learning, which uses subgreedy policy to replace the greedy policy in Q-learning, is developed for continuous action spaces, and Multi Pseudo Q-learning (MPQ) is proposed to reduce the overestimation of action-value function and to stabilize the learning. As for the actors, deterministic policy gradient is applied to update the weights, and the final learned policy is defined as the average of all actors to avoid large but bad updates. Moreover, the stability analysis of the learning is given qualitatively. The effectiveness and generality of the proposed MPQ-based deterministic policy gradient (MPQ-DPG) algorithm are verified by the application on AUV with two different reference trajectories. In addition, the results demonstrate high-level tracking control accuracy and stable learning of MPQ-DPG. Besides, the results also validate that increasing the number of the actors and critics will further improve the performance."
