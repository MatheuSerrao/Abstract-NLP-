The definition of actor (or stakeholder) roles and their interactions (at both business and technical levels), together with target scenarios and use cases, provide essential input information for further system requirement collection and architecture specification. The powerful and flexible Fifth Generation (5G) network slicing technology, which is capable of creating virtually isolated and logically parallel networks, enables a large range of complex services and vertical applications. Although various terminologies and models have been proposed in recent years for BMs in the 5G domain by many studies, projects, standards, and technical specifications from dedicated organizations, they are not always consistent with each other. This study presents an overview and comparison of different BMs for 5G sliced systems, followed by an example on BM definition for a 5G system in a novel ongoing European research project. While a general ecosystem and business model could involve a large range of organizations (including, e.g., regulation and standardization bodies), the scope of this article will be limited to primarily 5G operational BMs, with a focus on those actors or stakeholders who are active and interacting during real-life system operation. Within the project, we perform a selection among some tailored BM configurations, adapted for dedicated slices with different service requirements, aiming to serve Vehicle to Everything (V2X) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications as well as Internet of Things (IoT) for maritime vertical applications.

9343358,IoTDefender: A Federated Transfer Learning Intrusion Detection Framework for 5G IoT,"5G and edge computing promote the development of Internet of Things (IoT). In the near future, 5G will be used as infrastructure to connect all walks of life. At the same time, numerous resource-constrained IoT devices make attacks easier and more frequent, resulting in more and more serious harm. 5G needs to provide security for the IoT it carries. 5G IoT security faces three major challenges. First, due to the heterogeneity, diversity and personalization of IoT networks, it is impossible to use a single unified detection model. Second, data in various industries exists in the form of isolated islands so it is hard to share in the light of privacy protection. Third, data island makes some industries produce too little data to train a powerful intrusion detection model. Therefore, 5G needs a personalized, distributed and effective intrusion detection system that can integrate all IoT information under the premise of protecting the privacy of each IoT data.In this paper, we propose IoTDefender, an intrusion detection framework for 5G IoT based on federated transfer learning. 5G edge computing well supports the layered and distributed structure of IoTDefender. IoTDefender carries out data aggregation by federated learning and builds customized detection models by transfer learning. It enables all IoT networks to share information without leaking privacy. Consequently, IoTDefender owns excellent generalization ability, which can highly improve the detection of unknown attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that IoTDefender is more effective (91.93% detection accuracy on average) than traditional method. Furthermore, IoTDefender produces a lower false positive rate than that of a single unified model, which means it has advantages in personalization."

Therefore, with the rapid development of 4G network, major communication provider have begun to actively arrange 5G equipment and technology. However, miniaturization of SAW filter is one of the key components in 5G network development.

This article examines current 5G architectures and timely standardization efforts within this context. The contribution of this work is to identify associated 5G components and propose AI modules that enable efficient UAV-based SAR missions: the System Intelligence (SI) and Edge Intelligence (EI) concepts.

8728232,Mobility Management for 5G IoT Devices: Improving Power Consumption With Lightweight Signaling Overhead,"In mobile wireless networks, mobility management (MM) is an important process to track and locate user equipments (UEs), including Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, while moving throughout the network. In long term evolution (LTE) and fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, the two MM procedures are known as tracking area update (TAU) and Paging, which are burdensome for both mobile IoT/UEs and network-the IoT/UEs and network always initiate the TAU and Paging, respectively. Because of potentially very high-volume traffic and increasing density of high-mobility IoT/UEs, the TAU/Paging procedure increases the accompanied signaling overhead and the power consumption in the battery-limited IoT/UEs. Hence, this problem will become even worse in 5G because the latter is expected to accommodate exceptional services (e.g., longer IoT/UE battery lifetime). We propose a new solution to solve this problem, named gNB-based UE mobility tracking (gNB-based UeMT). This solution has four features achieving 5G goals. First, the mobile IoT/UEs will no longer trigger the TAU to report their location changes, giving much higher power savings with no signaling overhead. Instead, second, the network elements, gNBs, take over the responsibility of Tracking and Locating these IoT/UEs, giving always-known IoT/UE locations. Third, our Paging procedure is markedly improved over the conventional one, providing very fast IoT/UE reachability with no Paging messages being sent simultaneously. Fourth, this solution guarantees lightweight signaling overhead with very low Paging delay; it achieves about 92% reduction in the corresponding signaling overhead. To this end, our solution adds no implementation complexity; instead, it exploits the already existing LTE/5G communication protocols, functions, and measurement reports."
9171328,Pilot Contamination Attack Detection for 5G MmWave Grant-Free IoT Networks,"Grant-free random access is an emerging technology for providing massive connectivity for 5G massive machine-type communications (mMTC), where non-orthogonal pilot sequences are used to simultaneously detect active users and estimate channels. However, grant-free 5G IoT networks are vulnerable to pilot contamination attacks (PCA), where the attacker can send the same pilots as legitimate IoT users to harm the active user detection and channel estimation. To defend against this attack, in this article, we propose a physical-layer countermeasure based on the channel virtual representation (CVR). CVR can emphasize the unique characteristics of mmWave channels that are sensitive to the location of the sender. This can be utilized to counter PCA no matter if the attacker's pilots are superimposed to that of the victim or not. Based on this observation, to achieve an efficient PCA detection, a single-hidden-layer multiple measurement (SHMM) Siamese network is employed. This solution tackles the challenges of channel randomness and massive connectivity in mMTC IoT networks, and supports small sample learning. Simulation results evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme under various scenarios. The detection accuracy can approach 99% with 128 antennas at the receiver and reach above 95% even with only 50 training samples."

In this regard, future 5G networks aim at unified connectivity with an ambitious node density of 1,000,000 devices per square kilometer in the area of 5G massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC). In this regard, this work aims at analyzing the capability of LoRaWAN as a complementary solution in unlicensed frequency bands to contribute to given 5G requirements for specific mMTC applications in large-scale deployments. The performance evaluation indicates limited downlink capabilities due to regulatory requirements defined for the 868 MHz short-range device (SRD) frequency band, but at the same time depicts that the uplink can cover approximately 10% of the 5G mMTC connection density objective. Hence, LoRaWAN indicates a high potential to contribute to 5G mMTC application areas, especially for non-time-critical sensor use cases without or even with low Quality of Service (QoS) requirements."

The entire array is ultra-thin, being realized on a single PCB substrate. Each of the Huygens linearly-polarized (HLP) dipole elements is the result of a careful integration of one pair of metamaterial-inspired electrically small structures, i.e., an Egyptian axe dipole (EAD) and a capacitively loaded loop (CLL) near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) element. The EAD acts as the electric dipole radiator; the CLL works as the magnetic dipole radiator. They are oriented orthogonal to each other and are in-phase to radiate identical cardioid-shaped Huygens patterns in both the E- and H-planes. The consequent 1 × 4 Huygens array operates at 2.45 GHz with a high 8.9 dBi peak realized gain. It has a narrow E-plane 3-dB beamwidth, 28°, and a very broad H-plane beamwidth, 153°.

8383979,Fast Authentication and Data Transfer Scheme for Massive NB-IoT Devices in 3GPP 5G Network,"The emergence of narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) has brought hope for the popularization and application of mobile Internet standards. Nowadays, NB-IoT technology has been introduced into the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, where low-overhead, low-data-transmission IoT devices can securely access the fifth generation (5G) core network through the 3GPP access network. However, according to the current 3GPP standard, these NB-IoT devices still employ the traditional authentication process of normal user equipment to implement mutual authentication between NB-IoT devices and 5G core networks, which brings a lot of communication and storage overhead, and it will be more serious when lots of NB-IoT devices are activated simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a fast mutual authentication and data transfer scheme for massive NB-IoT devices, which integrates the access authentication and secure data transmission process and achieves the authentications and data transmissions of a group of NB-IoT devices at the same time. Our scheme can not only greatly simplify the authentication process and alleviate the load of the networks but also ensure robust security protection including user anonymity and nonrepudiation. The performance analysis results show that the proposed scheme can withstand a variety of security attacks with ideal efficiency."
9422665,On error correction performance of LDPC and Polar codes for the 5G Machine Type Communications,"Channel coding for the 5th generation (5G) wireless communication system has to fulfill diverse requirements arising from new machine type communication (MTC) services. The 5G-MTC applications can be classified into two categories: Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) and massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC). Polar code and Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) code are among the most advanced channel coding techniques known today that have the potential to be used in the 5G. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the error correction performance of Polar and LDPC coding schemes in the case when short to medium information block lengths are transmitted, as it is often in mMTC and URLLC scenarios. These codes are evaluated in terms of both Block Error Rate (BLER) and Bit Error Rate (BER).

9001075,Energy Efficiency in Security of 5G-Based IoT: An End-to-End Adaptive Approach,"The challenging problem of energy efficiency in security of the Internet of Things (IoT) is tackled in this article. The authors consider the upcoming generation of mobile networks, 5G, as a communication architecture for the IoT. The concept of adaptive security is adopted, which is based on adjusting the security level as per the changing context. It has the potential of reducing energy consumption by adapting security rather than always considering the worst case, which is energy consuming. The consideration of 5G introduces new dynamics that can be exploited to perform more adaptation. The proposed solution introduces an intelligence in the application of security, from the establishment phase to the use phase (end-to-end). The security level related to the used cryptographic algorithm/key is adapted for each node during the establishment phase, so to match with the duration of the provided services. A new strategy is formulated that considers both IoT and 5G characteristics. In addition, a solution based on the framework of the coalitional game is proposed in order to associate the deployed objects with the optimized security levels. Moreover, the application of security is also adapted during the use phase according to the threat level. Trust management is used to evaluate the threat level among the network nodes, while existing works focus on performing the adaptation during the use phase. The proposed approach achieves more adaptation through the consideration of both IoT and 5G dynamics.

The interest of this paper is to investigate a satellite 5G scenario for massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), where an intermediate layer of drones is used for collecting sensors data. We study an application where sensors are deployed in large rural (remote) areas for the timely detection of fire alarms (even if other types of measurements and alarms are possible). In this scenario, no terrestrial Internet connectivity is available so that drones are used to collect data from sensors and connect to a control station via satellite. A system architecture has been proposed and an analytical model has been adopted to characterize the mean delay to notify alarms from the field to the control center. This model takes shadowing and collisions effects into account. This study has been validated by means of simulations."

9058393,An ARQ-Based Cooperative Relaying Scheme for 5G IoT Slice,"We introduce a new twist to the classical automatic repeat request (ARQ)-based cooperative relaying scheme. Here, we target a 5G slice for offering internet-of-things (IoT)-inspired services. In this 5G application segment (e.g., utility or smart metering), utility sensors or devices are expected to last for decades and, operate on tight power budgets, and the system can tolerate periodic stops to check the fidelity of previous transmissions. For this scenario, we employ a service provider-deployed relay that alleviates the IoT devices of their communication burdens. The source transmits for a certain time window or period without requiring acknowledgments (ACK) from the destination. At the end of this window, the destination sends an ACK. If negative, the relay is expected to assist. Thus, the relay transmits only intermittently, in either one transmission time slot or a few time slots, using a suitably chosen higherorder modulation constellation. If no error occurs, the source continues its transmission. The numerical results show that with just a few antennas at the relay, the new scheme provides both a reduction in the number of ARQ transmissions and a superior probability of bit error compared with a reference scheme. We adopt the two-parameter Weibull fading model to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme."

Benefitting from the development of the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication networks and the technological advances of Internet of Things (IoT), the tactile Internet (TI), which provides control communications through the transmission of touch and actuation in real time, has been envisioned as a promising enabler of MC-IoT services.

9076479,Network Slicing in 5G and the Security Concerns,"The fifth-generation (5G) of mobile communications is currently being rolled out, with service providers adopting it in their networks. 5G enables the connection of multiple devices and their communication over the Internet, giving it the capability to support the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the technologies behind its support of multiple and diverse devices is the network slicing technology which helps in managing the logical networks comprising of different user equipment.

8854289,Online VNF Lifecycle Management in an MEC-Enabled 5G IoT Architecture,"The upcoming fifth generation (5G) mobile communications urge software-defined networks (SDNs) and network function virtualization (NFV) to join forces with the multiaccess edge computing (MEC) cause. Thus, reduced latency and increased capacity at the edge of the network can be achieved, to satisfy the requirements of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. If not properly orchestrated, the flexibility of the virtual network functions (VNFs) incorporation, in terms of deployment and lifecycle management, may cause serious issues in the NFV scheme. As the service level agreements (SLAs) of the 5G applications compete in an environment with traffic variations and VNF placement options with diverse computing or networking resources, an online placement approach is needed. In this article, we discuss the VNF lifecycle management challenges that arise from such heterogeneous architecture, in terms of VNF onboarding and scheduling. In particular, we enhance the intelligence of the NFV orchestrator (NFVO) by providing: 1) a latency-based embedding mechanism, where the VNFs are initially allocated to the appropriate tier and 2) an online scheduling algorithm, where the VNFs are instantiated, scaled, migrated, and destroyed based on the actual traffic. Finally, we design and implement an MEC-enabled 5G platform to evaluate our proposed mechanisms in real-life scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme maximizes the number of served users in the system by taking advantage of the online allocation of edge and core resources, without violating the application SLAs."
9473625,Generative Machine Learning for Resource-Aware 5G and IoT Systems,"Extrapolations predict that the sheer number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices will exceed 40 billion in the next five years. Hand-crafting specialized energy models and monitoring sub-systems for each type of device is error prone, costly, and sometimes infeasible. In order to detect abnormal or faulty behavior as well as inefficient resource usage autonomously, it is of tremendous importance to endow upcoming IoT and 5G devices with sufficient intelligence to deduce an energy model from their own resource usage data. Such models can in-turn be applied to predict upcoming resource consumption and to detect system behavior that deviates from normal states. To this end, we investigate a special class of undirected probabilistic graphical model, the so-called integer Markov random fields (IntMRF). On the one hand, this model learns a full generative probability distribution over all possible states of the system-allowing us to predict system states and to measure the probability of observed states. On the other hand, IntMRFs are themselves designed to consume as less resources as possible-e.g., faithful modelling of systems with an exponentially large number of states, by using only 8-bit unsigned integer arithmetic and less than 16KB memory. We explain how IntMRFs can be applied to model the resource consumption and the system behavior of an IoT device and a 5G core network component, both under various workloads. Our results suggest, that the machine learning model can represent important characteristics of our two test systems and deliver reasonable predictions of the power consumption."

In IoT, physical layer security is potential due to the vulnerability of wireless broadcasting in low computation capability and limited power source of the sensor nodes. In this regard, this article presents a secure and energy efficient V-MIMO enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer framework. The security framework uses beamforming and cooperative jamming signal to maximize the secrecy rate of the IoT systems. An optimization problem is formulated by collectively optimizing the beamforming vector, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio. Since the maximization problem is nonconvex, to find solution of the problem an iterative algorithm is presented, which inherently uses the penalty function to find the solution. It is evident from simulation results that the secrecy rate optimization of the proposed framework is better as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques considering various metrics."

8722595,5G-U: Conceptualizing Integrated Utilization of Licensed and Unlicensed Spectrum for Future IoT,"IoT applications constitute one of the fastest developing areas in today's technology and at the same time pose the most demanding challenges for the respective radio access network design. While the initial studies in IoT were focused primarily on scaling the existing radio solutions for higher numbers of small-data and low-cost sensors, the current developments aim at supporting wearable augmented/virtual reality platforms, moving industrial robots, driving (semi-)autonomous vehicles, and flying drones, which produce large amounts of data. To satisfy these rapidly growing performance demands, the 5G-grade IoT is envisioned to increasingly employ millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, where wider bandwidths promise to enable higher data rates and low-latency communication. While the mainstream trend in mmWave-based IoT is to rely on licensed bands around 28 GHz or leverage unlicensed bands at 60 GHz, in this work we introduce a conceptual vision for the integrated use of these frequencies within a single radio access system named 5G over unlicensed spectrum or 5G-U. We study the performance of 5G-U in supporting stringent IoT use cases, discuss and compare the alternative strategies for spectrum management in 5G-U, and demonstrate that a harmonized utilization of licensed and unlicensed bands provides notable performance improvements in both device-centric and network-centric metrics. Finally, we offer useful guidelines for future implementations of 5G-U and detail its potential applications in the area of advanced IoT services."

In general, base stations with proximity require lower transmission power of the IoT device (IoTD), thus saving energy consumption as spectral efficiency (SE) of the transmissions increase. By letting IoTDs send to base stations with better link conditions the IoTDs' battery lifetime is prolonged. In this paper, we present a many-to-many offloading scheme for uplink traffic. The scheme works when link conditions are private information and gives incentives to all involved players to participate. We believe this approach is better suited for the expected complex ecosystem of 5G base station cells. The sensitivity analyses show that there is a limited gain by requiring that the link conditions are public knowledge. Further, the suggested market optimizes the SE for all involved players. Numerical results show that the IoTDs can on average increase their SE with 25% and their spectral energy efficiency with 40%. The networks which are offloaded to and from can both expect an increase in the SE of 1%-6%. Sensitivity analyses show that the market equilibrium's benefits are robust as they stay positive for a range of different network configurations. Also, the work proves that market equilibrium is stable and unique. To derive the equilibrium, two approaches are presented, a closed form solution and a distributed algorithm, that both are solvable in polynomial time."

In addition, technologies, such as multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and network slicing provide another opportunity for the IoT to support more advanced and real-time services that could not have been previously supported. However, the simple integration of such technologies into the IoT does not take the full advantage of MEC and network slicing or the reduction of latency and traffic prioritization, respectively. Therefore, there is a strong need for an efficient integration mechanism for IoT platforms to maximize the benefit of using such technologies. In this article, we introduce a novel architectural framework that enables the virtualization of an IoT platform with minimum functions to support specific IoT services and host the instance in an edge node, close to the end user. As the instance provides its service at the edge node, where the MEC node and network slice are located, the traffic for the end user does not need to traverse back to the cloud. This architecture guarantees not only low latency but also efficient management of IoT services at the edge node. To show the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we conducted an experimental evaluation by comparing the transmission time of both IoT services running on the central cloud and those using sliced IoT functions in the edge gateway. The results show that the proposed architecture provides twice as much transmission speed as that from the conventional cloud-based IoT platform."

9647813,Predicting Video Bitrate from Encrypted Streaming Traffic in SDN-based 5G Networks with ML,"Video streaming applications currently dominate mobile network traffic. This predominance motivates network operators to optimize the network aiming at the quality of experience (QoE) of video streaming users. However, due to the widely adopted end-to-end traffic encryption, several key video-QoE indicators (KQI) that are useful to infer QoE are not readily available to the network operator. This work proposes a method to predict the video bitrate KQI from encrypted video streaming traffic. We compare the following machine learning (ML) algorithms for this task: Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. Since the only information available to the network operator are key performance indicators (KPIs), such as throughput, we use only information obtained from KPIs in our evaluations. We implement an open-source emulation setup for networking experiments to generate the data to train ML algorithms and a feature engineering procedure to obtain statistical features from the raw KPI data. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed method in two ML learning cases: offline and incremental, and discuss issues regarding the generalization capability of the ML algorithms."
9234408,Beyond 5G: Hybrid End-to-End Quality of Service Provisioning in Heterogeneous IoT Networks,"A significant increase is expected in video and multimedia traffic in Beyond 5G networks. The inclusion of a huge number of IoT nodes in Beyond 5G networks further complicates the design of such networks. These futuristic networks are expected to deal with this increased traffic and number of nodes while ensuring that network delays do not exceed a certain threshold. In such networks, Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning has become vital, not only to guarantee certain key performance indicators but also to improve user experience. This paper proposes a hybrid approach for end-to-end QoS provisioning, involving both clients and controllers to address these challenges. Each client tries to satisfy its own access QoS requirements by choosing optimal access device(s) and makes decisions based on locally available view. Controllers are then responsible for finding optimal paths in the core network to satisfy client core QoS requirements. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides better QoS guarantees than several other access device selection and routing schemes."

These cheap and powerful devices are expediting the development of IoT applications and this process is even accelerated by the forthcoming roll-out of the 5G technology. However, built-in analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) converters are often characterized by low accuracy and non negligible gain and offset error that actually turn out to increase the final cost and complexity by requiring additional hardware.In this work, we analyze the requirements of a wireless interface for BAS and we discuss some key design considerations arising from the use of a ESP32 microcontroller. The scope of such adapter is to provide retrofit compatibility to the already installed devices, by supporting the migration to IoT platforms and by providing at the same time flexible 5G-ready capabilities.

9016446,An Efficient Power Management Method For IoT Devices of Moving Network,"Recently, various machine type communication (MTC) has been used in various fields of 4G and 5G mobile communication. Besides, IoT devices used in moving network environments need to be highly available and have excellent battery efficiency. Among them, the IoT device, which is used for measurement and notification, intermittently transmits a small amount of data. The MTC with this characteristic has a small signal overhead for establishing an RRC connection, including a random access (RA) process for transmitting and receiving data. This paper proposes a method to reduce the overhead presented above. For a device having a characteristic of transmitting and receiving a small amount of data periodically and periodically, we propose a method of maintaining a bearer fluidly by setting up a dedicated bearer.

Particularly, high speed and wide band data transmissions in 5G and the following generations are core technologies to progress IoT [1], and many PCB materials have been proposed and the evaluations are ongoing. However, the low loss transmission still has to be improved furthermore so that the advanced communications can be utilized without any limitation. BT (Bis-maleimide & Triazine) resin, a kind of thermosetting resin materials has excellent mechanical and electrical properties derived from unique polymer net-working [2]. In this study, new BT resin designed for 5G and the following generations was developed [3]. Generally, PCB materials aiming for low loss transmission need to have low Dk (Dielectric Constant) and low Df (Dissipation Factor). Then the new BT resin was designed to have lower Dk and Df than the conventional BT resins ever had.In this study, compatibility of BT resin varnish was investigated firstly. Because, typically, some components bringing low Dk and low Df to BT resin show poor compatibilities with the main components due to the difference of polarity. Secondly, adhesion to copper foils was studied. To reduce the transmission loss, copper foils laminated on BT composite (BT resin fillers glass clothes) are desired to have low surface profiles. So, it was necessary to keep adhesion even if anchoring effect became smaller. Finally, BT laminates and package substrates were fabricated to assess mechanical behaviors, the electrical reliability and the transition of Df under high temperature or/and high humidity conditions. Especially, the stability of the dielectric properties under harsh conditions is very important to ensure the advanced electrical modules under actual environments.As the conclusion of this study, the novel BT resin has been developed and the excellent performances were successfully demonstrated.

9448772,The Implementation of a SIP-Based Service Platform for 5G IoT Applications,"Internet of things (IoT) technologies have been applied to realize various applications/services, ranging from massive, broadband, critical to industrial automation IoT applications. Recently, several IoT service platforms have been proposed to facilitate IoT application deployment, such as OpenMTC and IoTtalk. These platforms typically utilize the lightweight MQTT or CoAP application protocol to communicate with their served devices, both optimized for massive IoT applications within constrained networks. Unfortunately, these protocols are not applicable to those more advanced IoT applications, which demand high data rate and low latency. To provide a full range of supports for different IoT application scenarios, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be a better candidate, which, besides instant messaging, can also handle the long session semantic and the publish-subscribe semantic. In the literature, different SIP semantics have been utilized to implement different IoT applications/systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no generic SIP-based IoT service platform that integrates relevant capabilities for developers to flexibly develop/deploy heterogeneous IoT applications, demanding different quality of service. This paper implements a SIP-based IoT service platform, iSIPtalk, which enables rapid development of more advanced IoT applications. To justify the applicability of iSIPtalk, we deploy a real testbed and implement a vehicular service within our proposed iSIPtalk. Finally, via delay measurements using the real testbed and the vehicular service, we demonstrate the performance of our iSIPtalk."

The design is formulated as the joint optimization of interference aware UL/DL decoupling, airtime resource allocation and energy transfer. The key insight of our algorithm is to translate the original, intractable joint-optimization problem into a problem space where a good approximate solution can be quickly found. We evaluate our scheme through theoretical analysis and simulation. The evaluation shows that our approach improves the system utility by over 20% compared to start-of-the-art in dense IoT HetNets.

Fifth generation (5G) network can flexibly support a variety of devices and services, which makes it possible to combine 5G with IoT. In this paper, a novel multichannel IoT is proposed to dynamically share the spectrum with 5G communication, where an IoT node including transmitter and receiver is designed to perform 5G communication and IoT communication simultaneously. The subchannel sets allocated for 5G communication and IoT communication are defined by two complementary spectrum marker vectors, respectively. Two independent spectrum sequences are generated by calculating the inner products of spectrum marker vectors, presudo-random phases and power scaling vectors. Two time-domain fundamental modulation waveforms generated by the inverse fast Fourier transform of the spectrum sequences are used to modulate 5G data and IoT data, respectively. The receiver can detect the data using the same spectrum marker vectors as the transmitter. The BER performances of the system using binary modulation and cyclic code shift keying modulation in the cases of spectrum marker error and multiple access are analyzed, respectively. A subchannel and power optimization unit is formulated as a joint optimization problem, which seeks to maximize the 5G throughput under the constraints of minimal IoT throughput, maximal power, and maximal interference. An alternative optimization problem is proposed to maximize the IoT throughput while guaranteeing the minimal 5G throughput. A joint optimization algorithm based on Lagrange dual decomposition is proposed to achieve the optimal solution.

9036866,A Sidelink-Aided Approach for Secure Multicast Service Delivery: From Human-Oriented Multimedia Traffic to Machine Type Communications,"To date, group-oriented communications have been mainly exploited for delivering multimedia services in human-oriented communications while, in future fifth generation (5G) cellular networks, objects will be the main target. Internet of Things (IoT) will undoubtedly play a key role in 5G networks, wherein massive machine-type communications (mMTC) feature a use case as crucial as challenging since cellular IoT connections are predicted to grow heavily in the next future. To boost capacity and energy efficiency, the 5G network can leverage device-to-device (D2D) communications which are recognized as an effective offloading technique. This is achieved thanks to the fact that, in legacy D2D communications, data are directly sent from one device to another, avoiding the crossing of the network. Obviously, the distributed nature of such a communication paradigm and the inherent broadcast nature of the wireless channel make it necessary to think how to secure the so called “sidelink” transmissions. This work proposes a protocol for the efficient and reliable management of multicast services in a 5G-oriented IoT scenario, in which security is a crucial requirement to be met. The proposed protocol is tailored to Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and makes use of D2D communications with the aim of improving network efficiency and optimizing network resource utilization. In addition, cyber security and social trustworthiness mechanisms are exploited to secure D2D communications."

8806667,5G-SSAAC: Slice-specific Authentication and Access Control in 5G,"The fifth generation of mobile cellular networks (5G) is designed to support a set of new requirements and use cases, including connectivity for the IoT (Internet of Things). Due to the industry and the user's expectation of having connectivity embedded into IoT devices, the “wholesale wireless connectivity” concept is gaining more and more attention. According to this concept, connectivity providers sell connectivity to 3 rd parties, which in turn provide it to their own devices. However, this concept brings also new architecture and security requirements that are not fully addressed by the state of the art. Taking advantage of the flexibility provided by virtualization technologies (including network slicing), we propose in this paper a new 5G-SSAAC (5G Slice Specific Authentication and Access Control) mechanism that delegates authentication and access control of the devices to the 3 rd parties providing these devices, thereby decreasing the load of the connectivity provider's CN (core network), while increasing flexibility and modularity of the whole 5G network."

8932462,Extreme Coverage in 5G Narrowband IoT: A LUT-Based Strategy to Optimize Shared Channels,"One of the main challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) is providing communication support to an increasing number of connected devices. In recent years, the narrowband radio technology has emerged to address this situation: narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), which is now part of 5G. Supporting massive connectivity becomes particularly demanding in extreme coverage scenarios, such as underground or deep inside building sites. We propose a novel strategy for these situations focused on optimizing NB-IoT shared channels through the selection of link parameters: modulation and coding scheme, as well as the number of repetitions. These parameters are established by the base station (BS) for each block transmitted until reaching a target block error rate (BLERt). A wrong selection of these magnitudes leads to radio resource waste and a decrease in the number of possible concurrent connections. Specifically, our strategy is based on a lookup table (LUT) scheme which is used for rapidly delivering the optimal link parameters given a target QoS. To validate our proposal, we compare with alternative strategies using an open-source NB-IoT uplink simulator. The experiments are based on transmitting blocks of 256 bits using an AWGN channel over the NPUSCH. Results show that, especially under extreme conditions, only a few options for link parameters are available, favoring robustness against measurement uncertainties. Our strategy minimizes resource usage in all scenarios of the acknowledged mode and remarkably reduces losses in the unacknowledged mode, presenting also substantial gains in performance. We expect to influence the future BS software design and implementation, favoring connection support under extreme environments."

The proposed scheduler considers two types of IoT traffics; Machine-to-Machine (M-M) and Human-to-Human (H-H) communications by guaranteeing the network performance and avoiding ineffective exploitation of available resources. The simulation results prove that the proposed DBS operates efficiently in terms of maximizing the bandwidth utilisation rate which is an important challenge of the 5G radio resource allocation."

9057455,"A Privacy-Preserving Authentication, Authorization, and Key Agreement Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks in 5G-Integrated Internet of Things","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have played an important role in the Internet of Things (IoT), and the 5G network is being considered as a major candidate for IoT's communication network with the advent of 5G commercialization. The potential of integrating WSNs and 5G in the IoT is expected to allow IoT to penetrate deeply into our daily lives and to provide various services that are convenient, but at the same time, it also brings new security threats. From this aspect, user authentication and key agreement are essential for secure end-to-end communication. As IoT devices, including sensors, collect and process more and more personal information, both anonymous authentication and authorization are also required to protect the privacy and to prevent anyone without privileges from accessing private data. Recently, Adavoudi-Jolfaei et al. proposed an anonymous three-factor authentication and access control scheme for real-time applications in WSNs. However, we found that this scheme does not provide sensor-node anonymity and suffers from user collusion and desynchronization attacks. In this paper, we introduce a system architecture by considering the integration of WSNs and 5G for IoT. Based on a cryptanalysis of Adavoudi-Jolfaei et al.'s scheme and the system architecture, we propose an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based privacy-preserving authentication, authorization, and key agreement scheme for WSNs in 5G-integrated IoT. We conduct a formal and informal security analysis in order to demonstrate that the proposed scheme withstands various security attacks and guarantees all desired security features, overcoming the drawbacks of Adavoudi-Jolfaei et al.'s scheme. Finally, a performance and comparative analysis with the related schemes indicate that the proposed scheme is both efficient and more secure."

9018763,Broadband Dual-Polarized Phased Array with Broadside and Endfire Radiation for 5G Millimeter Wave Communications,"A broadband millimeter-wave dual-polarized phased array with broadside and endfire radiation characteristic is proposed. The orthogonally fed square patch element with dual-polarized operation is designed on three substrate layers. From the top to the bottom substrates, the parasitic patch, the driven patch and the slot-coupled feed network are etched. The stacked parasitic patch could expend the bandwidth and improve the gain of the antenna element. Two orthogonal strip feed lines excited by the coaxial lines couple the signal through two H-shaped slots, which results in a high isolation of dual polarization operation. A 3×3 array is formed by placing the element diagonally with the space of 0.36λ 0 . With the appropriate phase differences of each element, the array can achieve dual-polarized wide-angle beam-scanning performance both in the broadside and endfire direction. The simulated results show that the phased array can operate from 24.5 to 31.3 GHz (24.4%) with |S 11 | less than -10 dB. The array can scan in a range of ±75° at the broadside direction with the gain from 12.7 to 14.1 dBi, and scan 360 °at the endfire direction with the gain from 6.7 to 8.4 dBi.

In this paper, we investigate the multi-operator dynamic spectrum sharing problem to support the coexistence of rate guaranteed cellular users and massive IoT devices. For the spectrum sharing among mobile network operators (MNOs), we introduce a wireless spectrum provider (WSP) to make spectrum trading with MNOs through the Stackelberg pricing game. This framework is inspired by the active radio access network (RAN) sharing architecture of 3GPP, which is regarded as a promising solution for MNOs to improve the resource utilization and reduce deployment and operation cost. For the coexistence of cellular users and IoT devices under each MNO, we propose the coexisting access rules to ensure their QoS and the priority of cellular users. In particular, we prove the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) solution, which can maximize the payoffs of MNOs and WSP simultaneously. Moreover, we propose an iterative algorithm for the Stackelberg pricing game, which is proved to achieve the unique SE solution. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that, the payoffs of WSP and MNOs are maximized and the SE solution can be reached. Meanwhile, the proposed multi-operator dynamic spectrum sharing algorithm can support more than almost 40% IoT devices compared with the existing no-sharing method, and the gap is less than about 10% compared with the exhaustive method."

9367555,On TOA-based Ranging over mmWave 5G for Indoor Industrial IoT Networks,"mmWave frequency bands have gained much research interest in 5G NR for their extreme data speeds, capacity, and availability on a licensed/unlicensed basis. As the propagation losses are very high in mmWave bands, it requires directional beamforming, which can additionally be beneficial in time-of-arrival (TOA)-based ranging techniques. To satisfy high reliability and low latency requirements of industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT) in a factory environment, estimation of location-dependent propagation delays for essential industrial devices is critical. In this paper, we first model the mmWave TOA-based ranging coverage and error behavior for a single industrial device at various distances in an indoor factory environment. Later, the ranging error statistics are used to study the timing advance (TA) mechanism as an estimator for ToA-based indoor ranging, which can alternately be used to assess the coordination/synchronization accuracy among industrial devices. Our results reveal that mmWave-based ranging performs significantly better, bringing over-the-air timing synchronization accuracy to the nanosecond level. Specifically, the observed maximum synchronization errors for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios are 6.4 ns and 16 ns, respectively."

9181348,D2D Groupcast in 5G Heterogeneous Networks,"The goal of 5G wireless networks is to support a diverse set of requirements spanning low-latency, high connectivity, and high bit-rates. Support for the multitude of deployment scenarios is enabled by 5G Quality of Service (QoS) flows. In 5G, an inbound service from outside the cellular network can be separated into multiple QoS flows and scheduled onto multiple data bearers; each 5G data bearer meets specific QoS requirements. These requirements include extended networks, as enabled by UE-to-Network Relays. Typical examples are the networks formed by Device to Device (D2D) User Equipment (UEs) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Traditional latency-driven assignment methodologies typically assign a fixed Latency / Sub-Carrier Spacing (SCS) to each multicast flow, as directed by the QoS requirements. A drawback to traditional approaches is they do not account for the impact of multi-path / delay spread, as such they are unable to efficiently utilize the allocated radio spectrum in high delay spread radio environments; low latency flows are more sensitive to high delay spread. In this research work we derive an optimal QoS to 5G data bearer mapping for an extended network, subject to the constraints imposed by UEs and the UE-to-Network Relay. Compared to legacy multicast methodologies, our methodology can achieve an equivalent or higher throughput while minimizing deviation from the original latency requirements."

While the aim of this technology is to provide global coverage to the low-cost IoT devices distributed all over the globe, the vital role of satellites to complement and extend the terrestrial IoT network in remote or under-served areas has been recognized. In the context of having the global IoT networks, low earth (LEO) orbits would be beneficial due to their smaller propagation signal loss, which for the low complexity, low power, and cheap IoT devices is of utmost importance to close the link-budget. However, while this would lessen the problem of large delay and signal loss in the geostationary (GEO) orbit, it would come up with increased Doppler effects. In this paper, we propose an uplink scheduling technique for a LEO satellite-based mMTC-NB-IoT system, able to mitigate the level of the differential Doppler down to a value tolerable by the IoT devices. The performance of the proposed strategy is validated through numerical simulations and the achievable data rates of the considered scenario are shown, in order to emphasize the limitations of such systems coming from the presence of a satellite channel."

In this paper, the focus is on optimizing and evaluating Wi-Fi 6 and 5G New Radio (NR) licensed and unlicensed wireless networks for meeting the packet latency and reliability requirements of critical IIoT applications. The study is based on extensive system simulations using a 3GPP-defined IIoT indoor factory framework and application traffic models. Each radio technology is individually optimized leveraging the pros and cons of that technology to maximize the carried load in the network while fulfilling the delay requirements at a specified reliability level of 99.999 %. In addition to a performance comparison, the paper also provides deployment guidance for applying each radio technology in the considered IIoT setting. With proposed latency aware scheduling and when operated in interference free spectrum, Wi-Fi 6 can support <; 1 ms applications at a very low load, whereas the performance gap with respect to 5G NR reduces as delay requirements are relaxed to 10-100 ms. Conditioned on the fulfilment of the application latency and reliability requirements, unlicensed 5G NR shows nearly 2× the spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi 6 in all available configurations.

9620574,Solving the Gain/Coverage Problem to enable 5G-Powered IoT,"Mm-wave 5G base-stations are capable of emitting unprecedented EIRPs, necessary to achieve its high data rates. This capability introduces the opportunity to also use this wireless resource to wirelessly power IoT devices. However, the passive recipients of such power densities would need large enough apertures to harvest appropriate power levels to operate, which would naturally limit their angular coverage. In this work, we present an unconventional solution to this problem through the implementation of a passive beamforming network-the Rotman lens-in the receiving mode, as an intermediate element between antenna arrays and rectifiers to enable the surprising combination of high gain and wide angular coverage. The fully-printed, flexible Rotman lens, operating in the mm-wave regime, is equipped with eight antenna ports and six beam ports, selected based on a scalability study. Tested in both planar and bent configurations, the Rotman lens demonstrates a robust, ultra-broadband behavior, with minimum variations in its gain and angular coverage over more than 20 GHz of bandwidth.

Apart from enhanced network performance, a practical and reliable security scheme is needed to handle the trust management while preserving user privacy at the same time. The emerging 5G mobile communication system is viewed as a prominent technology for ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. Furthermore, incorporating software-defined network (SDN) architecture into the 5G-VANET enables global information gathering and network control.

In this paper, we consider a Service Provider (SP) that launches a smart city service based on IoT data readings: in order to serve IoT data collected across different locations, the SP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across sites and IoT data collection patterns. We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of SPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the SP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the SP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data."

However, because the data traffic throughput sharply increases with the number of IoT devices, a tremendous burden on the backhaul links and core networks results. With this in mind, mobile edge caching is an effective method that can relieve stress of the backhaul links, while decreasing the service latency. The purpose of this study is to analyze the problem of jointly optimizing cooperative edge caching and radio resource allocation in 5G-enabled massive IoT networks. For that, a joint optimization long-term nonlinear integer programming problem is posed. This class of problems is known to be NP-hard; thus, to reduce the problem complexity, a divide and conquer scheme will be applied—the task at hand will be divided into two subproblems: 1) cooperative edge caching and 2) radio resource allocation. The cooperative edge caching subproblem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process. Herein, a deep reinforcement learning method to optimize the caching decisions for all the edge nodes. Then, based on the resulting optimal caching decisions, the radio resource allocation subproblem for each edge node is posed as an NLIP problem, and an improved branch-and-bound method is proposed to yield the optimal radio resource allocation decisions for each edge node. Extensive simulations were performed to confirm that the proposed methods have the capability of enhancing the content caching hit ratio, while lessening the content retrieving delays for 5G-enabled massive IoT networks—improving over various baseline algorithms."

This work attempted to use Game theory techniques (mainly, graph-coalition-formation game) where it obtained enhanced results in 5G-standards D2D uplinks environment, this is due to employing relatively lower complexity approach to this problem. Reduction of computation complexity is introduced here through applying a preparatory stage of validating the active links of coalition members first via a proposed approach of finding all the possible links between them first, then, omitting the non-candidate members of the computations steps.

It is also expected that in 5G networks, future smart home services will be much powered by mobility management, which enables users to remotely access and control their in-home Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and appliances anywhere anytime any device. As a major solution, Distributed IP Mobility Management (DMM) can be considered because it addresses the limitation of the centralized approaches as well as its flat architecture is suit for 5G networks. Obviously, without being protected, mobility management can cause smart home systems to be vulnerable to various security threats. Especially, it is of paramount important to protect data traffic transmitted between user mobile devices and their in-home IoT appliances because they include users' sensitive and critical privacy information.

8817919,A Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework for the Exploitation of Multiple RATs in the IoT,"The IoT is the cornerstone of many innovating processes such as those behind Smart Cities and Smart Industries. As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device. Finally, to evaluate the proposal, we have simulated a network of 1000 devices deployed in the city of Chicago. The obtained results are compared to those achieved with other intuitive policies to further highlight the benefits of our proposal."

9024702,Gnomon: Decentralized Identifiers for Securing 5G Iot Device Registration and Software Update,"Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new class of cryptographically secure identifier that does not require a centralized trust anchor for attesting to the validity of keying material. DIDs are based on distributed ledger (blockchain) technology and allow the entity itself to manage its own identifier, hence the name ""self-sovereign"" which is often applied to them. In this paper, we describe Gnomon, a system that uses DIDs to securely register 5G IoT devices and install firmware/software into the device. Gnomon is designed to avoid the kind of difficulties that plague current technology, which is largely based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and X.509 public key certificates. After a short introduction, we review current practice and briefly describe DIDs and verifiable credentials, a mechanism based on DIDs to securely assert information about the identified entity. We then describe the architecture of Gnomon and a prototype we built, based on the ION DID scheme, for applying DIDs and verifiable credentials to 5G IoT device registration and software installation."

By combining such emerging technologies, interconnected sensors, instruments, and other industrial devices are networked together with industrial applications, formulating the Industrial IoT (IIoT) and aiming to improve the efficiency and reliability of the deployed applications and provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees.

This trend has motivated the development of the long-term evolution-vehicle (LTE-V) network, a 5G cellular-based vehicular technology. Due to the limited bandwidth for vehicular communications, it is important to efficiently utilize slim spectrum resources in vehicular networks. In this paper, we introduce a cloud radio access network (C-RAN)-based vehicular network architecture, named C-VRAN, which facilitates efficient management and centralized processing of vehicular networks.

In such applications, energy sustainability and communication and storage resource usage optimization are two of the key issues of interest. In this study, on one hand it is intended to develop indigenous beyond state of the art multi-sensing boards with the inherent smartness in energy replenishment and sensing/communication activities.

9595209,NFV-Enabled Hybrid Scalability for IoT Slices,"Nowadays, with the fast-growing of IoT services, we need to deal with a gigantic amount of requests they generate. To tackle this problem, the next generation 5G network not only utilizes Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to slice one physical network into multiple virtual networks called network slices, to support IoT services of diverse varieties, it also provides scalability on these IoT slices to manage the system capacity according to the incoming demands. This research proposes a hybrid scalability algorithm, designed to perform both vertical and horizontal scalability simultaneously on IoT slices. Previous research supports either vertical or horizontal scalability but rarely combines the applications of both simultaneously. This research designs hybrid scalability and compares its performance with that of either horizontal scalability or vertical scalability alone. The evaluation results show that a hybrid scalability algorithm not only can achieve high efficiency in term of throughput and response time, but also can optimize the resource utilization in terms of CPU utilization and power consumption."
9448962,A Proxy Signature-Based Drone Authentication in 5G D2D Networks,"5G is the beginning of a new era in cellular communication, bringing up a highly connected network with the incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT). To flexibly operate all the IoT devices over a cellular network, Device-to-Device (D2D) communication standard was developed. However, IoT devices such as drones utilizing 5G D2D services could be a perfect target for malicious attacks as they pose several safety threats if they are compromised. Furthermore, there will be heavy traffic with an increased number of IoT devices connected to the 5G core. Therefore, we propose a lightweight, fast, and reliable authentication mechanism compatible with the 5G D2D ProSe standard mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a distributed authentication with a delegation-based scheme instead of the repeated access to the 5G core network key management functions. Hence, a legitimate drone is authorized by the core network via offering a proxy signature to authenticate itself to other drones. We implemented the proposed protocol in ns-3 that supports 5G D2D-based communication. We also conducted computational calculations on the RaspberryPi3 IoT device to mimic the drone calculation process and delays. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is lightweight and reliable."
8811212,Low-Loss Additively-Deposited Ultra-Short Copper-Paste Interconnections in 3D Antenna-Integrated Packages for 5G and IoT Applications,"High-bandwidth 5G and 6G communication systems will inevitably migrate to 3D package architectures with backside or embedded dies and antenna-integrated packages for ultra-low losses and smaller footprints. With the trend to such 3D millimeter-wave (mm-wave) packages, the losses from the assembly and through-vias tend to dominate the overall losses. Traditional wirebond and thick solder interconnections lead to large mm-wave interconnect losses that are not acceptable for emerging 5G and 6G communications. This paper focuses on the material syntheses and process development of nanocopper interconnections with ultra-low interconnect losses for chip-last or flip-chip assembly in packages. The first part of the paper introduces the material synthesis of an innovative copper paste with shorter sintering times and temperatures. Optimized conditions are obtained to attain a conductivity of 1.4×10 7 S/m. This is equivalent to 82% increase in conductivity compared to that of solder. The surface roughness is also measured through atomic-force microscopy. Results suggest that the copper paste features higher roughness than that of solders. The second part of this paper discusses the potential of novel nanocopper paste to replace solders as a package assembly material, focusing on the effect of the conductivity and surface roughness with regard to the insertion loss in interconnection bumps. Based on the improved material properties of nanocopper paste, the model shows a 53% reduction in the dB scale at 28 GHz, by employing nanocopper paste. Die shear test for copper paste is also performed to show a high potential to replace solders as a flip-chip assembly material in both printed-circuit-board and mm-wave packaging technologies."

Current proposals for devices typically use cellular networks as the backhaul or final hop. These devices will leverage existing trust-based client-side channel metrics, such as Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), when the base-station determines scheduling decisions. In this paper, we investigate the scheduling impact of a malicious device when it changes its channel metrics, so as to improve its download rate or even to negate the download rate of others. We utilise real-time 4K ultra-high definition video delivery as an example of high throughput demand application and compare the delivery rates of multiple devices in an open-source 5G simulated NS-3 network. Our results illustrate that when a malicious client deceives the scheduler, the other clients in the network have a noticeable decrease in both viewable quality and underlying delivery rate (25% decrease in the average video quality across the non malicious clients)."

9154993,Dynamic Packet Scheduling for Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) devices in 5G Satellite Networks,"The continuous rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has presented a new model in fourth generation and beyond cellular networks. This continuous growth and the increasing demand in the provision of high transmission rate, delay sensitive and spectrum efficient cellular networks have made the development of fifth generation (5G) networks a reality. The design of the end-to-end 5G networks anticipated the need for terrestrial radio access networks to be complemented by its satellite counterpart in order to ensure that 5G services are provided seamlessly. These 5G services include IoT communications. This has necessitated the need for 5G satellite radio access networks to provide access to IoT devices that are located in remote and rural areas. This type of IoT devices are termed Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) devices.

9448904,Network Slicing for Massive Machine Type Communication in IoT-5G Scenario,"Network slicing is a key component of the envisioned 5G network. Slices are virtual networks purpose-built for tenants using a shared infrastructure. The slicing process is mathematically known as a virtual network embedding problem (VNE). Despite the plethora of VNE strategies in the literature, they do not take into account the fact that massive data transmission can be carried in a certain period. Embedding a large number of virtual networks to a real physical network over time is an NP-Hard problem, and it becomes more complex because of new considerations such as periodicity, amount of data and duration. Thus, we propose the NS4MIoT, a solution to allocate slices resources for each tenant, allowing it to be aware of each transmission's periodicity, amount of data, and duration. NS4MIoT is an approach to increase the quantity of requisition mapped in an envisioned 5G network for IoT massive communication. To validate our solution, we incorporate it into two different embedding algorithms. Furthermore, we compare the same algorithms with and without the NS4MIoT approach, and the outcomes demonstrate an improvement in the mapping rate in all cases when it is incorporated."

According to the current 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, NB-IoT devices still use the traditional access authentication method to perform mutual authentication with the network, which may bring a large amount of signaling and communication overhead. This problem will be magnified in a large-scale device environment in the future 5G network. In this article, a quantum resistance access authentication and data distribution scheme is proposed for large-scale NB-IoT devices. The scheme can simultaneously implement access authentication and data transmission of a group of NB-IoT devices based on the lattice-based homomorphic encryption technology.

9221152,New Vision for 5G Backbone Network Architecture,"Today’s routing infrastructure uses BGP for interdomain routing, which suffers from several well-known issues - slow convergence, lack of transparency, limited control in routing, and limited scalability for handling the massive IPv6 address space. As a result, it cannot meet the stringent requirements 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), which has been designed for latency-critical real-time applications such as tele robotics and augmented reality, and must scale up to support millions of IoT devices. To address these shortcomings of today’s routing infrastructure, we propose a four layer hierarchical network architecture, that associates a real (geographical) address with each IP address. The real address has four parts - country, state, district, and AS - that correspond to the four layers of routing hierarchy, and is used for inter-domain routing; the IP address is used for routing only within an AS. The hierarchical routing using geographical addresses enables quick convergence, fewer number of routing hops, and a very small number of forwarding rules in each router. Each network layer can further be sliced for the three broad categories of 5G users i.e mBBC, MTC and uRLLC. As deploying a new architecture across the globe is challenging, we discuss how it can be incrementally deployed one country at a time, exploiting existing infrastructure for international routing."

The high speed SMT process accomplishes the high-density with more than 50 discrete passive as well as active components and heterogeneous integration on package level approach. The development of double side technology offers the advantage of package size shrinkage by the same integrating discrete passive and active components layout. In this paper, the innovative packaging solutions of 3D double side SiP including the platform for both strip form of substrate base and wafer form of Fan-Out Redistribution Layer (RDL) base will be well introduced. Fan-Out RDL is an extension approach of Wafer Level Chip Scale Package (WLCSP), this technology is different from conventional wire bond or flip chip packages because the redistribution dielectrics and fine-line plated conductors are used for interconnection to replace the packaging substrates. As a case study, the calculation of 3D SiP package size can be shrunk around 50% area and the total package thickness can achieve around 15% z-height reduction with thin form coreless substrate and Fan-Out RDL technology utilization. The characterization analysis will apply simulation methodol...

9034103,"Toward Tactile Internet in Beyond 5G Era: Recent Advances, Current Issues, and Future Directions","Tactile Internet (TI) is envisioned to create a paradigm shift from the content-oriented communications to steer/control-based communications by enabling real-time transmission of haptic information (i.e., touch, actuation, motion, vibration, surface texture) over Internet in addition to the conventional audiovisual and data traffics. This emerging TI technology, also considered as the next evolution phase of Internet of Things (IoT), is expected to create numerous opportunities for technology markets in a wide variety of applications ranging from teleoperation systems and Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) to automotive safety and eHealthcare towards addressing the complex problems of human society. However, the realization of TI over wireless media in the upcoming Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond networks creates various non-conventional communication challenges and stringent requirements in terms of ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability, high data-rate connectivity, resource allocation, multiple access and quality-latency-rate tradeoff.

8780308,QoS Guarantees for Industrial IoT Applications over LTE - a Feasibility Study,"Industrial automation systems traditionally require communication systems to have high availability, high security and low latency. This results in efficient protocols with low protocol-processing overhead, but somewhat rigid communication systems that are cumbersome to scale up when deployed. On the other hand, Internet Protocol based communication - which is often preferred by IoT systems - offer high flexibility, but best-effort reliability. Furthermore, various radio access technologies have been created for IoT devices facilitating their IP networking as well. Nevertheless, these wireless technologies are rarely capable of corresponding to the strict requirements of complex industrial use cases, they usually cannot certain the necessary Quality of Service (QoS) promises.On the contrary, 5G mobile technologies are being developed exactly for such industrial and automation IoT use cases. Certainly, there are traffic prioritization techniques available for 4G and 5G systems, but their capabilities need to be investigated for Industrial IoT feasibility, before deployment. This paper aims to provide a feasibility study for applying mobile networking technologies (4G and 5G) - and its QoS guarantees - to IIoT applications. The proposed methodology can be extended for benchmarking whether a given use case can benefit from applying mobile networking for its various industrial and automation systems."
9625510,Performance of Channel Access Mechanisms for 5G Industrial-IoT over Unlicensed Bands,"Industrial-IoT (IIoT) is one of the key areas where 5G is expected to expand its application into. IIoT requires higher reliability as well as lower latency when compared to typical IoT services. In 3GPP, IIoT is supported as part of 5G utilizing many of the features that were introduced for ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC). In this paper, two channel access mechanisms under consideration for 5G IIoT in 3GPP are studied; i) dynamic channel access mechanism known as LBE (load based equipment) and ii) semi-static channel access mechanism known as FBE (frame based equipment). Average latency performance is compared for the two mechanisms using mathematical analysis and numerical results based on 3GPP evaluation assumptions. It is observed that FBE is beneficial in a congested environment where the wireless channel is likely to be busy and LBE is useful in a non-congested environment where the wireless channel is not likely to be busy."

These challenges are more serious in the quantum communications era, where certain attackers might have quantum computing capabilities, which renders IoT devices more vulnerable. This paper addresses the problem of IoT security by investigating quantum key distribution (QKD) in beyond 5G networks. An architecture for implementing QKD in beyond 5G IoT networks is proposed, offloading the heavy computational tasks to IoT controllers, while considering the use case of sensors deployed in railroad networks. Neural Network (NN) techniques are proposed in order to detect the presence of an attacker during QKD without the need to disrupt the key distribution process. The results show that the proposed techniques can reach 99% accuracy."
8911660,Evaluation of Cellular IoT for Energy-constrained WAIC Applications,"Current aircraft sensor networks provide wired connectivity between sensors and avionics systems. This leads to inflexible cabin design, extra weight and high maintenance costs. For these reasons, the Wireless Avionics Intra-Communications (WAIC) standard defines the requirements of future wireless communication systems onboard next-generation aircraft. The majority of WAIC applications involve energy-constrained low data rate devices, which will operate over battery or with the support of energy harvesting techniques in the future. In this work, we investigate the suitability of the novel Long Term Evolution (LTE)/Fifth Generation (5G) wireless technologies for low data rate WAIC applications by means of analytical models and Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) hardware experiments. The evaluation is performed in a real airplane and in the presence of external coexisting radio altimeter interference. All the results demonstrate the feasibility and energy efficiency of deploying NB-IoT as well as emerging 5G IoT technologies for future WAIC applications in the absence of interference and motivate the development of robustness techniques to suppress it."

The smart grid concept relies on the integration of high-speed and reliable communication networking technologies in order to provide twofold benefits - one for the interconnection between the existing power grid and intelligent information systems, and another for enabling real-time grid monitoring via IoT devices. However, the security of IoT devices themselves is a challenge due to the trade-off between device cost and secure communication requirements. Further, current electricity grids require robust and secure wireless communication infrastructure to realize transformation to smart grids. The 5G networks are considered as an enabler for digitalization of power grids and facilitating IoT connectivity for future smart grids with several benefits such as low latency, ultra high speed, and improved reliability. However, the use of public 5G networks may introduce new types of security risks to the IoT-based smart grids infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze the security aspects of 5G security specifications released by the 3GPP standards organization from the perspective of IoT-based smart grids. In particular, we consider a smart grid scenario utilizing 5G as a wireless communication infrastructure, and present 5G benefits to several security aspects such as authentication, confidentially, integrity, resiliency, and availability. Further, we outline security risks to IoT-based smart grids originating from compromised 5G network-related infrastructure."

The narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a low-power wide-area enabling technology introduced by the 3 rd Generation Partnership in 5G. The objective of the NB-IoT is to enhance the mobile coverage area by increasing the number of repetitions of control and data packets between user equipment (UE) and the base station/evolved NodeB (BS/eNB). While these repetitions improve data delivery for delay-sensitive applications, they degrade the efficiency of the already resource-constrained IoT system by increasing the system overhead and energy consumption. Moreover, NB-IoT devices in the edge region of the cellular coverage area require more repetitions, which augment energy consumption. In this study, we investigate device-to-device (D2D) communication for NB-IoT delay-sensitive applications, such as healthcare-IoT services, to use two-hop communication instead of using a direct uplink. An optimization problem is formulated to achieve an optimal end-to-end delivery ratio (EDR). In addition, this study incorporates Q-Learning-based reinforcement learning (RL) for the selection of an optimal cellular relay, which assists NB-IoT UE in uploading sensitive data to BS/eNB. The proposed RL-intelligent-D2D (RL-ID2D) communication methodology selects the optimum relay with a maximum EDR, which ultimately augments energy efficiency."

The proposed RF power amplifier (PA) consists of two stages (driver and power). By changing the driver and the power stages bias voltages any mode of PA (class-AB\F) can be achieved. The class-AB or linear mode power amplifier design is appropriate for IoT, LTE, 5G, and multi-standard RF transmitters. Whereas the class-F or switching mode PA is suitable for IoT-LPWAN and Bluetooth applications. The class-AB mode has a saturated output power of 23 dBm at 4.8 GHz, a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 29.5 %, an output third-order intercept point (OIP3) equals 18 dBm, and for LTE 15MHz channel bandwidth the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is -36 dBc. On the other hand, the maximum PAE is 28% and the output power equals 22.3 dBm for the class-F mode. The proposed power amplifier occupies 0.88 mm 2 of the chip area where the active area equals 0.53 mm 2 . The power dissipation is 136 mW or 26 mW in the proposed class-AB or class-F PA modes, individually."
9024444,A Novel Group Retransmission Scheme for Industrial IoT over 5G,"This paper considers a hybrid automatic repeat and request (HARQ) scheme of groupcast data transmission for industrial Internet-of-Things (IoT) in 5G New Radio (NR) system. HARQ has been widely used for unicast transmission to improve reliability and resource efficiency. However, it becomes inefficient in industrial IoT scenarios that have a lot of target receivers in groupcast data transmission since each receiver may have different part failed to correctly decode. In this paper, a novel and efficient groupcast retransmission scheme for industrial IoT services by adopting a concatenated code structure with inner and outer codes is proposed. The amount of retransmitted data is minimized by only transmitting parity code blocks generated by the outer code, e.g., Reed-Solomon (RS) or Raptor code. In addition, the receivers send HARQ feedback information by utilizing the common resources, which can offer the improvement of uplink feedback coverage for IoT devices. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional HARQ schemes, reducing more than 50% of retransmissions."

To support this variable pattern, reconfigurable capabilities are to be delivered to access and metro networks. Furthermore, considering wireless networks, a centralized processing in a Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) needs reconfigurable abilities to bring benefits to mobile systems with dynamic demands of huge bandwidth between Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) at base stations and Baseband Units (BBUs) at the central office. In this paper, we propose a versatile metro-access network integrating FTTH, enterprises, IoT and 5G services.

8744209,User Driven Multiclass Cell Association in 5G HetNets for Mobile & IoT Devices,"Fifth generation (5G) needs to support plenty of applications and services with a wide variety of quality of service requirements. The deployment of ultra-dense small cells' networks as a part of the heterogeneous networks architecture is one of the key technologies to achieve this. In such a dense architecture, associating devices with the network is challenging. The traditional cell association algorithms use signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio metric. However, this is not appropriate for 5G, especially with the reduction in the cells size and the growing number of the user equipment (UE) and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we propose a distributed multiclass user-driven cell association algorithm based on the multi armed bandit game (CA-MAB) to connect devices with different requirements to the network. Here, we focus on two classes of devices: UE devices and low-power IoT devices. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in static and mobile environments, where the convergence and equilibrium are achieved. Our performance results are validated against the central cell association method that is complex and requires a huge amount of information exchange. The results show that CA-MAB throughput and energy efficiency are within 10% of the centralized solution. These values increase by less than 5% in the case of mobility. However, they reduce with more network densification."

We model a utility maximization problem based on the proposed framework. Then we proposed a reinforcement learning based two-stage network slice resource allocation algorithm, which uses the multi-agent Q-learning process to reduce the complexity of the Q-value table. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the whole network utility while ensuring the network performance of the virtual network operators compared with the baseline schemes."

The 3D printed ramp structures and inkjet printed transmission lines on top of that are suitable for mm-wave inter-layer connections because lower parasitics are induced to the system. Moreover, a system-on-package (SoP) design for backscattering radio-frequency identification (RFID) is proposed. It has to be stressed, that an RF energy harvester operated at 26 GHz which is embedded inside the packaging using additively manufacturing techniques is proposed for the first time. The output voltage of the harvested energy at a distance of 20 cm away from the source is 0.9 V with transmitted equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) equal to 59 dBm. The harvested energy is large enough to power the TS3001 timer for backscattering and can support all energy requirements of the entire SoP design so that the SoP design is fully autonomous and no external board or components are required.

Thanks to the safty, security and customization of 5G network pointed by 5G forum white paper, indoor positioning systems using unified 5G New Radio (NR) signals have become the focus of the next generation of visible light positioning (VLP) systems. In 5G New Radio(NR) frame, totally 192 sub carriers are used to carry positioning reference signal(PRS). In order to improve the position accuracy, the aim of this study is to investigate the method of the 5G NR subcarrier selection.

At present a typical battery life is ~2 years or less. With most devices operating for >10 years, it leads to multiple battery replacements resulting in device downtime and maintenance trade-offs as well as major economic and environmental issues related to the manufacture and disposal of hundreds of millions of batteries every single day. In addition, there are many untapped IoT applications due to the downtime implications and extreme costs and logistics of battery replacement throughout the device lifetime including medical technologies, implantables, and installations in harsh environments (Figure 1)."
9443613,5G enabled Mobile Operating Hospital and Emergency Care Service,"Critical care has frequently been fatal for trauma patients suffering from hemorrhage. The pre-hospital communication gap between the paramedics and the doctors contributes most towards this. This paper discusses a system model of a 5G-enabled communication architecture among the major trauma centres in the Greater Manchester. An Internet of sensors acquires and wirelessly communicates biosignals from the patient in real time, using 5G. These signals are then displayed as parameters to the closest trauma care management centres. This paper proposes a connectivity model that supports such a system by assessing and identifying the most optimal path for signal transmittance. A system-level 5G network modelling and simulation findings reveal that a signal-to-noise ratio of over 2dB is achieved for two base stations between the incident site and the nearest emergency medical centre. This value decreases by over 5 dB as the number of base station doubles. Hence, reconfigurable 5G base stations connectivity subsystems are required for critical vertical use cases of the radio standard."

These paradigms can be used in both grid-scale and local-scale, while the central grid operation center has interoperability with an abundant number of sub-controllers, and aggregators in a wide variety of scales. On the one hand, the system operator must deal with multiple parameters with different kinds of uncertainties. On the other hand, the new structures are evolving toward transactive energy trading models in microgrids. In such a circumstance, a myriad of elements is producing critical data, which should be acquired, transferred, stored, analyzed, and finally, proper controlling actions must be sent. These data are producing at different intervals, even in a fraction of a second. This matter makes it possible to maintain grid security and better real-time operation as well as to get better demand responsiveness. A smart grid consists of many embedded or interconnected systems that are linked to each other through various communication platforms in the cyber layer.

9346250,SGD2: Secure Group-based Device-to-Device Communications with Fine-grained Access Control for IoT in 5G,"The fifth generation (5G) mobile networks provide intensive and low-latency communications, which are applicable to an emerging data sharing/exchange technology called Device-to-device (D2D) communication. For a safety D2D communication, is essential to ensure the legitimacy of devices and the secrecy of communications before it practiced. However, the basic security specification can only support secure one-to-one or one-to-many D2D communications with the assistance of security-related components,i.e., access and mobility management function (AMF), authentication server function (AuSF), and unified data management (UDM), in the 5G core network. It results that 5G core networks always have to handled the discovery of mobile devices. Since the components related to user authentication are involved, the device discovery procedures result in no privacy for users. To overcome the above issues, this work proposes a secure attribute-based access control mechanism to support secure device discovery with fine-grained access control based on edge computing model for D2D communications in 5G, called SGD 2 . SGD 2 guarantees the privacy of D2D communications against the infrastructures of 5G mobile networks. Additionally, this work provides security analysis and empirical performance evaluation for the security and feasibility. To sum up, the proposed SGD 2 is the practice of D2D communications with the features of fine-grained access control and privacy against mobile network operators in 5G for the applications of IoT."
9221304,LTE-M Coexistence Within 5G New Radio Carrier,"In Re1-13 of 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE), 3GPP introduced LTE-M feature for supporting machine type communications used by the Internet of Things. LTE-M is a lowpower, wide-area cellular technology that can be deployed within existing 4G LTE networks. In 5G New Radio (NR), LTE-M has also been adopted by 3GPP to provide massive machine type communications support. The ability to deploy LTE-M technology in 4G network and reuse LTE-M technology in 5G network is beneficial as it prevents having two different technologies for the same use cases and therefore fragmenting the market. It also provides support for legacy 4G LTE-M devices as 4G systems are migrated to 5G. In this paper, we discuss deployment of LTE-M within 5G carrier including deployment options, coexistence issues, spectrum sharing, overhead analysis and enhancements."

Availability is targeted through multipronged Active/Passive attacks using DOS / DDOS (RF jamming / Bandwidth jamming with malformed packets) and reliability is targeted through exploiting existing architectural weaknesses of radio and data communication protocols (LTE-A / IP based Networking). In prevailing threat landscape, concepts of adoption and integration of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in 5G networks will open gateways of new networking paradigms with a focus on centralized security dynamics (overall visibility and substantial controls). These network security dynamics in diversified use cases (Internet of Everything /smart grids) will provide an optimum centralized control with a global overview, vigilant monitoring as well as prompt reaction (detection and prevention) to these prevailing threats. In this purview of the 5G cellular security matrix with a centralized SDN and NFV, this document has reviewed on 5G cellular secure communication channels to unearth the effectiveness of conventional DOS/DDoS and Authentication attacks within environment of SDN and NFV. This research will also present proposed mitigation of DOS / DDOS and incorporation of advanced authentication mechanism for more reliable cellular communication networks."
9087860,Dual Connectivity-Based Mobility Management and Data Split Mechanism in 4G/5G Cellular Networks,"The emerging 5G mobile network technology is envisioned to provide an efficient platform to interconnect machines, objects, and devices in addition to interconnecting people. Equipped with peak data rates, low latency, and massive capacity, 5G technology will empower new user experiences such as virtual reality and augmented reality and provide new service areas such as connecting massive IoT. Dual connectivity is an important feature where 5G systems are overlaid on the existing 4G core network. In this paper, we propose an MM (mobility management) algorithm to efficiently perform handovers between 4G and 5G RATs (radio access technologies). Our proposed MM algorithm utilizes the strength of DC (dual connectivity) for MM as DC inherently has lesser amount of handover interruption as compared to conventional hard handover. Our MM scheme suggests appropriate data split mechanism between 4G and 5G RATs based on application-specific strategy. We provide a framework based on probabilistic model checking that leverages DC and suggests strategy-based data split mechanism for a mobile user for a variety of market verticals. We model the system as MDP (Markov decision process) where a controller breaks all the nondeterminism in the MDP based on reward calculations. The proposed framework is implemented in a well known model checker and various scenarios are used to assess its applicability."

In fact, LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT are the three major LPWAN technologies which compete for IoT deployment. In this manuscript, we analyze and compare these technologies. The latter are efficiently applied to intelligent, autonomous and heterogeneous devices. Within this framework, 5G networks have to be used to guarantee full connectivity in the IoT networks."

Communication systems are upgraded to 5G networks to meet the demands of data, capacity and QoS, With the help of high speed data rate and a high QoS of signals, State-of-the-art technologies are also taking charge to address the requirements of energy efficiency.

8859212,DL-TCP: Deep Learning-Based Transmission Control Protocol for Disaster 5G mmWave Networks,"The 5G mobile communication system is attracting attention as one of the most suitable communication models for broadcasting and managing disaster situations, owing to its large capacity and low latency. High-quality videos taken by a drone, which is an embedded IoT device for shooting in a disaster environment, play an important role in managing the disaster. However, the 5G mmWave frequency band is susceptible to obstacles and has beam misalignment problems, severing the connection and greatly affecting the degradation of TCP performance. This problem becomes even more serious in high-mobility drones and disaster sites with many obstacles. To solve this problem, we propose a deep-learning-based TCP (DL-TCP) for a disaster 5G mmWave network. DL-TCP learns the node's mobility information and signal strength, and adjusts the TCP congestion window by predicting when the network is disconnected and reconnected. As a result of the experiment, DL-TCP provides better network stability and higher network throughput than the existing TCP NewReno, TCP Cubic, and TCP BBR."
8970868,IoT Protocols for Low-power Massive IoT: A Communication Perspective,"The constantly growing number of resource-limited MTC (Machine-Type Communication) devices is challenging both the telecommunication operators as well as industrial companies to efficiently design communication technologies, protocols, and end-devices for data transmissions in the upcoming 5G and beyond wireless communication networks. As the communication technologies for mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications)/massive IoT (Internet of Things) attracted significant attention over the past years due to the extended communication range and improved lifetime of battery-operated devices, the debate turned from the communication parameters of available Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) technologies towards the implementation issues related to efficient data transmissions with respect to certain level of Quality of Service (QoS). In this regard, this paper aims to analyze already introduced communication protocols (i.e., TCP, UDP, CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)) possible to use for data transmission in massive IoT scenarios. Along with the highlights of the protocols in question, a practical implementation is done using the emerging cellular IoT standard, namely, NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT). Out of the obtained data, the focus is primarily given to the side-by-side comparison of protocols' overheads and the subsequent data usage as the amount of transmitted data is deriving the monthly fees."
9498712,Data sharing scheme for 5G IoT based on blockchain,"The data of the Internet of Things has an extremely important value, but based on the existing data sharing mechanism, there will be inevitable security risks, such as node failure and data leakage. In the process of using blockchain technology to achieve efficient and reliable data sharing, data will inevitably be missing, redundancy and other anomalies. We propose an anomaly detection method called MAE (Memory Autoencoder). The effectiveness of the model have been tested on different types of data. The results show that compared with mainstream models, the MAE not only improves the anomaly detection effect, but also has better versatility."
9354554,Compact Multiport MIMO Antenna System for 5G IoT and Cellular Handheld Applications,"A low-profile, compact, four-element, eight-port multiple-input--multiple-output and diversity antenna for 5G Internet of Things and cellular handheld applications is presented in this letter. This antenna structure contains four antenna elements, which are same in its configuration. The antenna ground dimensions are taken similar to a modern mobile handset, i.e., 60 mm × 120 mm. The four antenna elements are situated at four corners of antenna ground structure. Each antenna element has two feeding ports, thus making a total of eight-port antenna. A single antenna element has two feeding plates, which are placed perpendicular to one another so that they become cross polarized, thus exploiting polarization diversity, whereas spatial diversity also exists between different antenna elements. For reducing mutual coupling between different antenna ports, slots are cut in ground plane, including a small strip etched along the entire length of ground plane and rectangular slots cut in ground plane under every antenna element. The minimum bandwidth attained by all eight ports for S 11 < –10 dB is more than 1.4 GHz from 2.4 GHz to more than 3.8 GHz, which testify that it covers majority of frequency bands allocated for 5G sub-6 GHz spectrum. The isolation obtained between different ports has a minimum value of –13 dB, and the maximum value goes below –30 dB. For the covered frequency bands by this antenna structure, the correlation coefficient is found to be below 0.03, whereas the measured peak gain is in the range of 3.2--5 dB."
8843414,Fog Computing Architecture for 5G-Compliant IoT Applications in Underserved Communities,"The fifth generation (5G) of wireless network ecosystem which is expected to be deployed in 2020 promises to provide higher speeds, higher capacity and lower latency than the current mobile networks. 5G is also envisioned to revolutionise the telecoms industry in unprecedented ways by enabling new applications and services that could change the way we live and do things. However, in areas with poor or lack of infrastructure, the deployment of 5G is a challenge for mobile operators because of the potential low return on investment. One of the promising technologies for low cost computing networks is fog computing, which selectively moves resources and services of computing, storage, control and networking at the edge of the network closer to the users, thereby improving the speed of decision-making, network cost, and the performance of the system. In this paper, we aim to investigate how fog computing can enable cost-efficient solutions in underserved areas to compensate for the economic drawback of low Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), and at the same time provide good quality service for users that meets essential performance requirements. We propose a fog-based architecture that exploits local computation, storage, communication, control, and decision making as a means to reduce communication costs and energy consumption and thus overcome the cost issue in 5G deployment. Preliminary simulation results show that the architecture performs better than cloud-only deployments in terms of energy consumption and delay in a smart agriculture system."
9437171,A Review on Communication Aspects of Demand Response Management for Future 5G IoT- Based Smart Grids,"In recent power grids, the need for having a two-way flow of information and electricity is crucial. This provides the opportunity for suppliers and customers to better communicate with each other by shifting traditional power grids to smart grids (SGs). In this paper, demand response management (DRM) is investigated as it plays an important role in SGs to prevent blackouts and provide economic and environmental benefits for both end-users and energy providers. In modern power grids, the development of communication networks has enhanced DRM programmes and made the grid smarter. In particular, with progresses in the 5G Internet of Things (IoT), the infrastructure for DRM programmes is improved with fast data transfer, higher reliability, increased security, lower power consumption, and a massive number of connections. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of potential applications of 5G IoT technologies as well as the computational and analytical algorithms applied for DRM programmes in SGs. The review holistically brings together sensing, communication, and computing (optimization, prediction), areas usually studied in a scattered way. A broad discussion on various DRM programmes in different layers of enhanced 5G IoT based SGs is given, paying particular attention to advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms alongside challenges in security, reliability, and other factors that have a role in SGs’ performance."
8909773,IoT-G: A Low-Latency and High-Reliability Private Power Wireless Communication Architecture for Smart Grid,"Communication network has become an essential part of smart grid infrastructure and is under fundamental change within the energy industry. Clear trends indicate that utilities are looking for an upgrade of communication solutions that are able to support massive connections, higher data rate, and lower latency. To achieve this goal, ownership or self-licensing is seen by the utilities as a much more cost effective method of accessing the spectrum. Nevertheless, for many countries, existing narrowband spectrum allocation are likely to remain unchanged for five to ten years due to existing licensed systems under operation. To avoid the difficulty of spectrum refarming, this paper introduces an innovative communication technology - Internet of Things-Grid (IoT-G) - which achieves excellent broadband transmission performances by aggregating existing fragmented narrowband spectrum. This technology inherits several key air interface design elements of 3GPP Release 15 IoT features as well as a number of low-latency design concepts from 3GPP 5G systems. Building upon the cellular ecosystem, IoT-G has a mature industrial chain including end-to-end chipsets, terminals and network equipment. It has passed multiple field tests in 2018, and is planned for large-scale nationwide deployment in 7 provinces and 22 cities in China in 2019."

Fifth‐generation (5G) wireless networks have the intensity of relating nearly all facets of life via networks at high speeds, very minimal potential, and omnipresent interconnection. Because of its importance to our survival, the network also needs to protect its consumers, its resources, and its services. The status of 5G security threats has grown significantly because of the exceptional growth in service and devices that are associated with it. A number of occurrences have exposed the risk posed by a wireless network. It not only causes security and privacy anxieties, but also interferes with the complexities of the communication environment. As a result, the efficiency of safety attacks has improved, creating the exposure or protection of damage in networks as a universal threat. This chapter describes the safety in wireless networks from 2G to 5G and Non‐IP networks. It explores the Internet of Things (IoT) background along with its basic requirements, characteristics, and related infrastructure. Furthermore, it explores some expected benefits of adopting IoT in organization such as benefits related to big data, openness of IoT, and linked aspects of IoT. Additionally, it examines some non‐5G technologies that address IoT requirements and discusses an advanced security model to achieve security in 5G networks. Finally, the challenges related to 5G networks along with the required possible solutions are outlined."
9299798,Optimizing Resource-Efficiency for Federated Edge Intelligence in IoT Networks,"This paper studies an edge intelligence-based IoT network in which a set of edge servers learn a shared model using federated learning (FL) based on the datasets uploaded from a multi-technology-supported IoT network. The data uploading performance of IoT network and the computational capacity of edge servers are entangled with each other in influencing the FL model training process. We propose a novel framework, called federated edge intelligence (FEI), that allows edge servers to evaluate the required number of data samples according to the energy cost of the IoT network as well as their local data processing capacity and only request the amount of data that is sufficient for training a satisfactory model. We evaluate the energy cost for data uploading when two widely-used IoT solutions: licensed band IoT (e.g., 5G NB-IoT) and unlicensed band IoT (e.g., Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and 5G NR-U) are available to each IoT device. We prove that the cost minimization problem of the entire IoT network is separable and can be divided into a set of subproblems, each of which can be solved by an individual edge server. We also introduce a mapping function to quantify the computational load of edge servers under different combinations of three key parameters: size of the dataset, local batch size, and number of local training passes. Finally, we adopt an Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based approach to jointly optimize energy cost of the IoT network and average computing resource utilization of edge servers. We prove that our proposed algorithm does not cause any data leakage nor disclose any topological information of the IoT network. Simulation results show that our proposed framework significantly improves the resource efficiency of the IoT network and edge servers with only a limited sacrifice on the model convergence performance."
9128495,Layer division multiplexing for 5G DL transmission within ultra-dense heterogeneous networks,"To date, the main focus of the wireless network has been considered human-centric end-use. Fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology is now evolving towards the era, where the focus is on large scale machine-type communication. 5G & beyond wireless networks are focused on enabling their new forms of usage of wireless connectivity, which are expected to deliver a large number of new applications & services into reality. This will result in a massive increment in terms of the number of users and heterogeneous service requirements. While providing such new applications and services, it is expected to ensure optimal utilization of resources. The challenges to be addressed to attain optimal resource utilization includes meeting heterogeneous capacity requirement to serve a massive number of devices with limited spectrum. The work presented in this paper is focused on exploring the possibility of layer division multiplexing (LDM) as a potential tool to resolve these challenges. While analysing the feasibility of LDM for 5G downlink transmission framework, we have considered unicast & multicast transmission scenarios. This paper presents an analytical framework to define the performance bounds of LDM in the context of 5G downlink transmission. The robustness of our analytical model has been validated with simulation results of LDM. We also have considered specific urban & rural use-case scenarios for 5G with LDM downlink transmission. Our analytical results suggest LDM core layer transmission is one of the strongest candidates for massive machine-type communication (mMTC) within 5G networks to attain enhanced coverage range compared to its existing counterpart."
9463809,Energy Efficient 5G LoRa Ad-Hoc Network for Smart Grid Communication,"With the advent of Energy Internet and the goal to enable the smart grids (SG), there have been advancements in both 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to achieve this. The circumstances of distribution power networks are getting more and more complicated with the wide coverage of modern power system, and there are diversified communication blind areas. In this paper, a communication framework based on 5G LoRa Ad-Hoc network is presented to support the diversified grid circumstances. Based on this framework, multiple LoRa can establish communication links with the SG cloud server though 5G LoRa gateway. Moreover, the flexibility in 5G LoRa Ad-Hoc networking configurations allows higher management in resource allocation and topology algorithm, which realizes better resource utilization, and improves network scalability and energy efficiency. Real measurement and simulation results show that proposed strategy is scalable and robust, and also offer supplementary and energy-efficient room for improvement with respect to existing approaches."
8936296,Cost-Reward-based Carrier Aggregation with Differentiating Network Slicing for Optimizing Radio RB Allocation in 5G New Radio Network*,"In 5G cellular network, to achieve an extremely high data rate and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) by using a limited radio frequency spectrum bands becomes a big challenge. 5G thus specifies the technologies of Carrier Aggregation (CA) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to increase the frequency spectrum efficiency and to dynamically allocate the virtualized network component for different classes of network slicing, respectively. CA can aggregate multiple contiguous or non-contiguous Component Carriers (CCs) and to improve frequency spectrum utilization and signal quality. In 5G NR, NFV can dynamically allocate network virtual radio resource for different classes of network slicing, e.g., emergency, uRLLC for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), e.g., Autonomous Self Driving Vehicle, Advanced Driving Assistant System, mMTC for sensing-based Internet of Things (IoTs), etc. However, different SINRs of different frequency spectrum bands suffer from the exiting radio nature of CCs. The CA effect and system capacity are thus limited obviously. This paper thus proposes the Cross-Layer NR scheduling with CC Aggregation (CLCA) in 5G NR network. CLCA contributes several algorithms: 1) Markov Decision Process-based cost reward Packet Selection (MDP-PS), 2) Adaptive Packet Scheduling (APS) and 3) Adaptive Component Carrier scheduling (ACC). Numerical results show CLCA outperforms the compared approaches in system capacity, network reward and packet failure rate."
8949102,Efficient Pilot Allocation for URLLC Traffic in 5G Industrial IoT Networks,"In this paper we address the problem of resource allocation for alarm traffic in industrial Internet of Things networks using massive MIMO. We formulate the general problem of how to allocate pilot signals to alarm traffic such that delivery is guaranteed, while also minimising the number of pilots reserved for alarms, thus maximising the channel resources available for other traffic, such as industrial control traffic. We present an algorithm that fulfils these requirements, and evaluate its performance both analytically and through a simulation study. For realistic alarm traffic characteristics, on average our algorithm can deliver alarms within two time slots (of duration equal to the 5G transmission time interval) using fewer than 1.5 pilots per slot, and even in the worst case it uses around 3.5 pilots in any given slot, with delivery guaranteed in an average of approximately four slots."

Hence, these place are digitally disconnected from the world. To overcome this challenge, 5G network slicing supporting multi-tenancy, also known as neutral host network, is studied to improve rural connectivity. The infrastructure provider (InP) deploys the rural 5G network and mobile network operators (MNOs) lease the slices from InP to serve their end-users. This aims to study the value network configuration (VNC) for the 5G network slicing architecture to understand the possible business model. As a result, three configurations are defined driven by micro-operator, MNO and community end-users respectively. The business models are constructed using SWOT analysis and business canvas models. The revenue streams for the proposed rural network are analyzed."
9246616,Prediction and Detection of FDIA and DDoS Attacks in 5G Enabled IoT,"Security in fifth generation (5G) networks has become one of the prime concerns in the telecommunication industry. 5G security challenges come from the fact that 5G networks involve different stakeholders using different security requirements and measures. Deficiencies in security management between these stakeholders can lead to security attacks. Therefore, security solutions should be conceived for the safe deployment of different 5G verticals (e.g., industry 4.0, Internet of Things (IoT), and so on). The interdependencies among 5G and fully connected systems, such as IoT, entail some standard security requirements, namely integrity, availability, and confidentiality. In this article, we propose a hierarchical architecture for securing 5G enabled IoT networks, and a security model for the prediction and detection of False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) and Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS). The proposed security model is based on a Markov stochastic process, which is used to observe the behavior of each network device, and employ a range-based behavior sifting policy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and model in detecting and predicting FDIA and DDoS attacks in the context of 5G enabled IoT."

9507153,Coverage and Deployment Analysis of NB-IoT Technology under Various Environment Scenarios,"Standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and introduced in release 13, the Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) technology seems well suited for wireless IoT end devices with low power consumption, low data throughput, and long-range communication requirements, which need to control and monitor environmental conditions in remote and harsh locations. However, being NB-IoT an emerging technology, it is necessary to study its reliability under such use-case scenarios. This paper presents an NB-IoT coverage analysis in the North region of Portugal under various environment scenarios: indoor, underground, and inside an underground concrete dome with an iron cover, using a custom-developed NB-IoT end device equipped with the Quectel BC66 as the communication modem and a custom application executing over the Azure ThreadX RTOS. Our investigation leans over the coverage quality based on some indicators collected, such as RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI, ECL, PCI, and transmission power. The obtained results indicate that this technology is capable of satisfying the requirements of the most demanding IoT applications, with percentages of successful transmissions above 96%, even at distances greater than 1400m between the device and the communication infrastructure (LTE) cell, or even in regions with very low/noise floor coverage."

In this paper, we compared the inband-mode and the guardband-mode of the NB-IoT system using the BER performance curve."
8674579,Clustered Virtualized Network Functions Resource Allocation based on Context-Aware Grouping in 5G Edge Networks,"With the wide spread of various smart devices and the proliferation of internet of things (IoT) sensors, the amount of traffic on mobile networks is rapidly increasing, and applications with extreme requirements are increasing. Network function virtualization (NFV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) are emerging as core technologies to satisfy users' real-time service demands. Adapting NFV technology to MECs allows the ability to assign cloud-computing capabilities near the base stations (BSs) of radio access networks (RANs), resulting in extremely fast service access to user equipment (UE). However, placement of virtualized network functions (VNF) within the edge network need to consider the location and the requirements of the user which change in real-time. There has been almost no consideration in the existing research on VNF resource allocation (VNF-RA) based on these aspects. Therefore, in this paper, a VNF resource allocation scheme based on context-aware grouping (VNF-RACAG) technology is proposed that enables groups (based on the geographic context of users, such as location and velocity) to compute the optimal number of clusters to minimize the end-to-end delay of network services. Then, a graph partitioning algorithm is used to minimize user movement between clusters, optimizing the data rate that users lose due to VNF migration."
9157298,Indoor Channel Characterisation and Modelling for 5G Applications at 22GHz,"Unprecedented growth in data traffic due to several high end customer applications such 3D visual, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), High Definition (HD) video enforce the efficient usage of existing spectrum and parallely demands additional frequency spectra in higher frequency bands for upcoming 5G ecosystem. In this work a new frequency spectrum is prescribed in K band that has an inherent atmospheric loss window. A microstrip patch antenna has been designed and fabricated in K band i.e. at 22GHz. In this manuscript we have investigated indoor channel characterisation at 22GHz and modelled the deviation Friis transmission equation for indoor environment for UDN and IoT application in 5G domain."
9622706,Reliable Edge Service for IoT Home Environment,"In the current IoT era, the internet holds a major role in providing the reliability of the IoT service. If the internet is not available then almost all the IoT services either stop or are limited to the home environment only. In a home environment, the internet is usually provided through an external fiber optical cable, which can be easily cut by an intruder who wants to break into the home. This means, in the absence of the internet, any emergency IoT notification alerts will not reach the registered remote user via an intermediate cloud server. In the case of home voice assistance speakers such as Alexa, Google Home, Galaxy Home, etc it won't be able to respond during the absence of the internet. These are the important problems we need to address for home IoT and security. From the “The Internet of Things”, the name itself it's very clear that the internet holds a vital role in the IoT space to have communication with the respective cloud system. Hence, it's very critical and necessary to provide reliable internet service for the seamless working of IoT devices. Here in this paper, we are proposing a distributed edge service that provides reliable internet service to a generic IoT hub or any other devices at any given point of time with the help of other devices available inside the home which are capable of providing the internet such as mobile devices, 5G, etc. Apart from the guaranteed internet, this paper also deals with the better Quality of Service (QoS) negotiation and selection which might be going to replace the existing router in terms of throughput. This reliable edge service for home IoT makes the intruder almost impossible to stop the alert notification to the registered user in case of a burglary and also helps the voice assistance devices to have uninterrupted communication."

The 5G network will revolutionize the existing wireless network with its enhanced capabilities and novel features. 5G New Radio (5G NR), referred to as the global standardization of 5G, is presently under the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and can be operable over the wide range of frequency bands from less than 6GHz to mmWave (100GHz). 3GPP mainly focuses on the three major use cases of 5G NR that are comprised of Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (uRLLC), Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB).

8825838,Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Resource Allocation in Fog RAN for IoT With Heterogeneous Latency Requirements,"In light of the quick proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices and applications, fog radio access network (Fog-RAN) has been recently proposed for fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to assure the requirements of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for the IoT applications which cannot accommodate large delays. To this end, fog nodes (FNs) are equipped with computing, signal processing and storage capabilities to extend the inherent operations and services of the cloud to the edge. We consider the problem of sequentially allocating the FN's limited resources to IoT applications of heterogeneous latency requirements. For each access request from an IoT user, the FN needs to decide whether to serve it locally at the edge utilizing its own resources or to refer it to the cloud to conserve its valuable resources for future users of potentially higher utility to the system (i.e., lower latency requirement). We formulate the Fog-RAN resource allocation problem in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), and employ several reinforcement learning (RL) methods, namely Q-learning, SARSA, Expected SARSA, and Monte Carlo, for solving the MDP problem by learning the optimum decision-making policies. We verify the performance and adaptivity of the RL methods and compare it with the performance of the network slicing approach with various slicing thresholds. Extensive simulation results considering 19 IoT environments of heterogeneous latency requirements corroborate that RL methods always achieve the best possible performance regardless of the IoT environment."

Despite 5G's vision to cater to IoT, yet some of the aspects are still optimized for human-to-human (H2H) communication. More specifically, the existing group paging mechanism in LTE-A Pro has not yet clearly defined approaches to group, mobile IoT devices (MIDs) having diverse characteristics, such as discontinuous reception (DRX) and data transmission frequency (DTF) with various mobility patterns. Inappropriate grouping of MIDs may lead to increased energy consumption and degraded quality of service, especially in terms of packet arrival delay (PAD) and packet loss rate (PLR). Therefore, in this paper, we devise novel models to estimate PAD, PLR, and energy consumption for MIDs, specifically for the group paging mechanism. Based on the proposed models, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective to minimize energy consumption of MIDs, while providing required PAD and PLR. The nonlinear convex optimization problem addressed herein is solved using the Lagrangian approach, and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions have been applied to derive optimal characteristics for MIDs to join the group, namely, DRX and DTF. The extensive numerical results presented verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the mathematical models demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over random grouping approach concerning significant energy consumption of MIDs."

Currently, 5G cellular networks are being deployed worldwide, the new technologies of which have brought the approaches for improving the performance of wireless indoor positioning. In this paper, we investigate the indoor positioning under the 5G new radio (NR), which has been standardized and being commercially operated in massive markets. Specifically, a solution is proposed and a software defined receiver (SDR) is developed for indoor positioning. With our SDR indoor positioning system, the 5G NR signals are firstly sampled by universal software radio peripheral (USRP), and then, coarse synchronization is achieved via detecting the start of the synchronization signal block (SSB).

Several studies have been conducted to address the security problems; however, existing protocols do not support dynamic security policy and key management in a decentralized structure as well as secure handover in a specific scenario where Terminals (TMs) are moving. Motivated by this, we proposed the Mobile Terminal Handover Security Protocol (MoTH) to provide secure handover of mobile terminals between hubs.

9449224,5G Radar and Wi-Fi Based Machine Learning on Drone Detection and Localization,"Drone usages have been proliferating for various government initiatives, commercial benefits and civilian leisure purposes. Drone mismanagement especially civilian usage drones can easily expose threat and vulnerability of the Government Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) that hold crucial operations, affecting the survival and economic of the country. As such, detection and location identification of these drones are crucial immediately prior to their payload action. Existing drone detection solutions are bulky, expensive and hard to setup in real time. With the advent of 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), this paper proposes a cost effective bistatic radar solution that leverages on 5G cellular spectrum to detect the presence and localize the drone. Coupled with K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, the features of Non- Line of Sight (NLOS) transmissions by 5G radar and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) emitted by drone are used to predict the location of the drone. The proposed 5G radar solution can detect the presence of a drone in both outdoor and indoor environment with accuracy of 100%. Furthermore, it can localize the drone with an accuracy of up to 75%. These results have shown that a cost effective radar machine learning system, operating on the 5G cellular network spectrum can be developed to successfully identify and locate a drone in real-time."
9249093,Self-Organising LEO Small Satellite Constellation for 5G MTC and IoT Applications,"Small satellite constellations are an attractive alternative to provide ubiquitous connectivity to Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G machine-type communication (MTC) applications in areas where terrestrial network coverage is limited. In order to provide global coverage using small satellite networks flying in low earth orbit (LEO), a large constellation of at least hundreds of satellites is needed. As LEO satellites can only connect directly to the ground earth station (GES) sporadically, they need to forward data over inter-satellite links (ISLs) to reach the GES. In this paper, we propose a novel self-organising architectural design for small satellite constellations with ISLs, supporting automated commissioning and control of the satellite network. We specifically present an algorithm for autonomous ISL establishment and channel selection, that avoids interference among ISLs of the same satellite."
9527825,An Efficient and Secure Handover Mechanism for SDN-Enabled 5G HetNet,"New 5G technology enables network connectivity for innumerable IoT, mobile, and sensor devices. This massive involvement of tremendous devices with diverse architectures creates a complete Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) within 5G. Efficient and secure handover management in 5G HetNet is immensely challenging due to the connected devices and cell structures’ diversity. Although some researches attempt to address this issue, the complete design of the handover process, considering the diversity of 5G HetNet, is still missing. This paper introduces an SDN-enabled unified and efficient handover scheme to ensure seamless mobility in 5G HetNet. The proposed scheme expedites the performance through idle scanning and supports Device-to-Device (D2D) communication. Besides, our scheme ensures data privacy through the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and prevents illegal access through device authentication. Security analysis endorses the security properties of the proposed scheme. Moreover, experimental results reveal that our scheme reduces handover delay by nearly 50% through idle scanning and achieves approximately 25% and 43% communication reduction in intra-domain and inter-domain handover, respectively, compared to the existing work."

9352955,Resource-Optimized Recursive Access Class Barring for Bursty Traffic in Cellular IoT Networks,"A massive number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication devices generate various types of data traffic in cellular IoT networks: periodic or nonperiodic, bursty or sporadic, etc. In particular, bursty and nonperiodic traffic may cause an unexpected network congestion and temporary lack of radio resources. In order to effectively accommodate such bursty and nonperiodic traffic, we propose a novel recursive access class barring (R-ACB) technique to optimally utilize the available resources associated with the random access procedure (RAP) that consists of multiple steps in cellular IoT networks, while existing ACB schemes only considered the resource of the first step of RAP, i.e., the number of available preambles. The proposed R-ACB technique consists of two main parts: 1) online estimation of the number of active IoT/M2M devices who have data to transmit to an eNodeB and 2) adjustment of the ACB factor that indicates the probability that an active device sends a preamble to eNodeB. It is notable that the estimation and the adjustment recursively affect each other when R-ACB operates. In addition, we also propose mathematical models to analyze the performance of R-ACB in terms of total service time, average access delay, resource efficiency, and energy efficiency (EE). Through extensive computer simulations, we show that the proposed R-ACB technique outperforms the conventional ACB schemes."
9621182,Fine Frequency Offset Synchronization Scheme for Internet of Things Devices in 5G non-terrestrial network,"In this paper, we propose a center frequency offset (CFO) estimation and correction algorithm for chirp-spread spectrum (CSS) modulated LoRa waveform in a non-terrestrial network (NTN). However, the frequency of the terrestrial LoRa compensates for signal bandwidth in reciprocal units of a symbol duration, which is coarse and therefore cannot effectively compensate for random frequency offset by the Doppler shift. Furthermore, to realize satellite IoT, a link budget must be achieved using large spreading factors, which are more problematic in satellite IoT because LoRa has the property of being sensitive to frequency offset as the spreading factor increases. To overcome this problem, we propose a fine frequency offset synchronization scheme using FFT. Computer simulation results show that our proposed algorithm works well in the Shadowed Rician fading channel."

8896929,Intelligent Traffic Adaptive Resource Allocation for Edge Computing-Based 5G Networks,"The popularity of smart mobile devices has led to a tremendous increase in mobile traffic, which has put a considerable strain on the fifth generation of mobile communication networks (5G). Among the three application scenarios covered by 5G, ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency (uRLLC) communication can best be realized with the assistance of artificial intelligence. For a combined 5G, edge computing and IoT-Cloud (a platform that integrates the Internet of Things and cloud) in particular, there remains many challenges to meet the uRLLC latency and reliability requirements despite a tremendous effort to develop smart data-driven methods. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on artificial intelligence for controlling mobile-traffic flow. In our approach, we first develop a traffic-flow prediction algorithm that is based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with an attention mechanism to train mobile-traffic data in single-site mode. The algorithm is capable of effectively predicting the peak value of the traffic flow. For a multi-site case, we present an intelligent IoT-based mobile traffic prediction-and-control architecture capable of dynamically dispatching communication and computing resources. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing communication latency and its impact on lowering packet-loss ratio. Finally, we present future work and discuss some of the open issues."

9708411,A Directly Connected OTA Measurement for Performance Evaluation of 5G Adaptive Beamforming Terminals,"Spatially beamformed communication, which is achieved by antenna array and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technologies, has become the most critical technology to drastically increase spectrum utilization rate of 5G. To guarantee the successful deployment of 5G, different aspects of device design, particularly those related to radio-frequency front end and antenna array for enabling beamformed communication, have to be accurately verified. It is more cost-effective to identify design imperfections through lab testing rather than using field testing based trial and error approaches, especially for the explosive growth of 5G enabled internet of things devices. In this paper, a directly connected over-the-air (OTA) test solution for 5G MIMO OTA evaluations with focusing on dynamic beamforming devices is proposed. The proposed solution can mathematically achieve constructions among the S ports of base station and U ports of receiving antenna array, which makes it possible for measuring throughput of terminal with adaptive beamforming array in an OTA way. All system parameters are emulated including S elements base station antenna gain, U elements of receiving terminal performance and 3D S×U propagation channel characteristics. To further validate the theoretical analysis and test procedure, a newly developed 4×4 5G MIMO device is measured in terms of its throughput.

However, since current smartphones remain resource and battery-limited, the 5G era opens new challenges on how to actually support these applications. In principle, the service orchestration capability of the Fog and Cloud Computing paradigms could be an effective means of dynamically providing resource-augmentation to smartphones. Motivated by these considerations, the peculiar focus of this paper is on the joint and adaptive optimization of the resource and task allocations of mobile stream applications in 5G-supported multi-tier Mobile-Fog-Cloud virtualized ecosystems. The objective is the minimization of the computing-plus-network energy of the overall ecosystem under hard constraints on the minimum streaming rate and the maximum computing-plus-networking resources. To this end: 1) we model the target ecosystem energy by explicitly accounting for the virtualized and multi-core nature of the Fog/Cloud servers; 2) since the resulting problem is non-convex and involves both continuous and discrete variables, we develop an optimality-preserving decomposition into the cascade of a (continuous) resource allocation sub-problem and a (discrete) task-allocation sub-problem; and 3) we numerically solve the first sub-problem through a suitably designed set of gradient-based adaptive iterations, while we approach the solution of the second sub-problem by resorting to an ad-hoc-developed elitary Genetic algorithm. Finally, we design the main blocks of EcoMobiFog, a technological virtualized platform for supporting the developed solver. The extensive numerical tests confirm that the energy-delay performance of the proposed solving framework is typically within a few per-cent the benchmark one of the exhaustive search-based solution."

In 5G-enabled Internet of Thing (IoT) systems, data is stored and shared with high efficiency and reliability. When the number of IoT devices is increasing, security and privacy issues become prominent. Existing two-factor authentication mechanism is not secure against potential attacks. In addition, it is not possible for single-server architecture to satisfy the needs of the users since they must store massive credentials.

These challenges are more serious in the quantum communications era, where certain attackers might have quantum computing capabilities, which renders IoT devices more vulnerable. This paper addresses the problem of IoT security by investigating quantum key distribution (QKD) in beyond 5G networks.

Afterwards, Artificial neural network (ANN) and deep learning (DL) techniques are proposed in order to detect the presence of an attacker during QKD without the need to disrupt the key distribution process. An architecture for implementing QKD in beyond 5G IoT networks is proposed, offloading the heavy computational tasks to IoT controllers.

The 5G wireless network system is expect to support different resource services sorted Constant Bit Rate, Variable Bit Rate, Available Bit Rate and Unspecific Bit Rate Request of Services. In this paper, we propose a multiple access protocol for the signal with an integrated mix of multimedia traffic in the 5G wireless network. When the buffer of base station is empty in high speed network system, services are assigned priority class on the base of Time-to-Live (TTL) with respect to the service source types within each TTL class. There is a need of piggybacking request with the package transmissions synchronously when the packets arrive at a non-empty buffer. It also shows the transmission requests are placed collision-free. The multiple access schemes are very challenging such as more efficiency, intelligent, no subsequence collision and cybersecurity. The expect simulation results are evaluate the packet throughput, packet loss and packet delay. The results illustrate the proposed scheme has better performance than the conventional packet reservation multiple access, distributed queuing request update multiple access and adaptive request channel multiple access for the 5G wireless network."

To reduce energy consumption when the traffic is low, new BSs feature Advanced Sleep Modes (ASM) that allow to reduce the network energy consumption by gradually deactivating the BSs into progressively deeper sleep modes with lower power consumption. However, the deep sleep modes cause high reactivation delays that may jeopardize the Quality of Service.In this paper, focusing on the periods in which traffic is very low, we extensively investigate the potentiality of ASMs based operation in terms of the trade-off between energy saving and delay under different 5G scenarios and traffic loads. By observing that optimal configuration settings depend on the scenario and on the load, we design a framework based on a stochastic model to perform dynamic tuning of the configuration settings that adapts in real time the parameters to the actual traffic load and scenario."

9626155,Ultra-Low-Power IoT Communications: A novel address decoding approach for wake-up receivers,"Providing energy-efficient Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity has attracted significant attention in fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks and beyond. A potential solution for realizing a long-lasting network of IoT devices is to equip each IoT device with a wake-up receiver (WuR) to have always-accessible devices instead of always-on devices. WuRs typically comprise a radio frequency demodulator, sequence decoder, and digital address decoder and are provided with a unique authentication address in the network. Although the literature on efficient demodulators is mature, it lacks research on fast, low-power, and reliable address decoders. As this module continuously monitors the received ambient energy for potential paging of the device, its contribution to WuR’s power consumption is crucial. Motivated by this need, a low-power, reliable address decoder is developed in this paper. We further investigate the integration of WuR in low-power uplink/downlink communications and, using system-level energy analysis; we characterize operation regions in which WuR can contribute significantly to energy saving. The device-level energy analysis confirms the superior performance of our decoder. The results show that the proposed decoder significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art with power consumption of 60 nW, at cost of compromising negligible increase in decoding delay."

In today's fast-paced economy, almost every sector of the economy is dependent on energy resources. On the other hand, the energy sector is mainly dependent on fossil fuels and is constituting about 80% of energy globally. This massive extraction and combustion of fossil fuels lead to a lot of adverse impacts on health, environment, and economy.

Privacy is the fundamental right of every individual. 5G industries and organizations need to preserve it for their stability and competency. Therefore, privacy at all three levels (data, identity and location) need to be maintained. Further, energy optimization is a big challenge that needs to be addressed for leveraging the potential benefits of 5G and 5G aided IIoT. Billions of IIoT devices that are expected to communicate using the 5G network will consume a considerable amount of energy while energy resources are limited. Therefore, energy optimization is a future challenge faced by 5G industries that need to be addressed. To fill these gaps, we have provided a comprehensive framework that will help energy researchers and practitioners in better understanding of 5G aided industry 4.0 infrastructure and energy resource optimization by improving privacy. The proposed framework is evaluated using case studies and mathematical modelling.

The information symbols that are coherently combined along the multiple delay-Doppler diversity branches experience the same channel gain. New Radio (NR) based Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G standard can support high-speed automated vehicular network that can be termed as vehicular IoT (V-IoT). At high speeds, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based transmission suffers from high intercarrier (or symbol) interference, making it unsuitable. In this paper, we have proposed a less complex NR-based IoT (NR-IoT) system with OTFS that performs better than NR-IoT with low-density parity-check (LDPC). We thereby eliminate the computational complexity of LDPC decoding in our scheme. We have evaluated our proposed technique of uncoded NR-IoT with OTFS over the extended vehicular channel model-A and ultra-reliable low latency communication channel. We have achieved a 6 dB SNR gain with our proposed NR-IoT system with OTFS."
9343245,Data Authentication and Anonymization in IoT Scenarios and Future 5G Networks Using Chaotic Digital Watermarking,"Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios and applications are envisioned to be supported by emerging 5G networks. In this context, complex routing schemes for pervasive infrastructures are highly simplified, as every hardware element may stablish its own communication link with a 5G base station. However, this situation also introduces new risks, especially in the security field where innovative cyber-physical attacks and distributed denial of service attacks are becoming more popular and dangerous each day. Thus, data authentication, protection and anonymization in those new applications and schemes is a key challenge to be addressed. Besides, most devices in future IoT systems will be resource constrained, so traditional solutions based on private keys stored in devices' memory and computationally heavy cryptographic algorithms will turn unsecure, inefficient or, directly, impossible to run. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new mechanism to protect, authenticate and anonymize data in IoT systems supported by future 5G networks. The proposed solution employs both digital watermarking techniques and lightweight cryptographic technologies. To generate keys in a secure and simple manner, physical unclonable functions are employed. Besides, to reduce as much as possible the computational cost of algorithms, chaotic dynamics will be considered. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution an experimental validation based on simulation techniques is also carried out."

The advancement in autonomous vehicle and Internet of Things (IoTs) gives the challenge to incorporate high efficiency antennas into the vehicle for wireless communication. However, the transmitters and receivers need to be low-profile, high bandwidth, high gain, and cost effective to enable vehicle telematics. In this paper, a dual band low profile shark fin integrated multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna is proposed for 5G and Wi-Max communications. Initially, a corporate fed patch antenna array and a quasi- Yagi antenna is designed for 5G and Wi-Max frequency bands respectively. These two optimized antennas are vertically incorporated, and further optimized to work for dual band applications at 26 GHz and 5.5 GHz. The effects of the gap and parasitic elements between the antennas on the resonance and realized gain pattern are parametrically studied. The simulation results show that the dual band antenna operates from 5.16 GHz to 6.05 GHz and 25.625 GHz to 26.36 GHz with 10 dB return loss bandwidth with a realized gain of 4.43 dB at 5.5 GHz and 4.79 dB at 26 GHz.

In the IoT era, the application of products such as smart cities and smart homes will provide people with a more convenient and quality life. 5G is the prelude and foundation for achieving this. In the 5G mobile communication system, the base station performs adaptive coding and modulation based on the channel state information fed back by user, and improves the spectrum efficiency by selecting different combinations of modulation types and code rates. Therefore, the channel state information estimated by receiver side needs to be mapped to a value measuring the overall channel state and fed back to the base station. This paper first simulates the modulation and coding schemes(MCS) given in the 5G standard under Gaussian channels, and obtains the SNR-BLER curves of different MCS. Then, the scheme of SNR mapping to CQI is improved, and a new mapping relationship between SNR and CQI is obtained by performing region fitting. Finally, for the adjustment factor optimization process, a new adjustment factor is introduced and the calculation formula for the optimization factor is modified. The BLER is taken as the logarithm and then used Logarithmic results to find the mean square error, thereby reducing mapping errors Compared with the traditional scheme, the proposed scheme has higher throughput, so as to better promote IoT technology."

However, the huge number of IoT devices are likely to create an immense burden on current wireless networks. Interestingly, next-generation 5G wireless networks envision the usage of mmWave frequencies for a manifold increase in data rates and user capacity. Nevertheless, the inherent LoS in mmWave communications raises significant new challenges in providing seamless coverage across the dense 5G networks. Emerging D2D communications are expected to offer a viable solution for this LoS challenge by providing relay services and extending the coverage. An NLoS device can use direct D2D communications for transmitting the data by using other LoS devices. The selection of relay requires maintaining a certain level of trust and privacy of the content. In this article, we explain that similar to human SN, personal trust among devices can be efficiently used to develop trustworthiness in D2D relay communications. By introducing a new distributed architecture for social relationships in D2D communications, we discuss and analyze new methods for a dynamic social relationship and trust management mechanism. Efficient and trustworthy social D2D relay networks significantly improve the capacity of mmWave 5G wireless networks. Simulation experiments corroborate our improvement in IoT device capacity and throughput. We also present coexistence of the proposed scheme with the existing state-of-the-art relay selection schemes."

9221100,Lightweight IoT Malware Detection Solution Using CNN Classification,"Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming more frequently used in more applications as the number of connected devices is in a rapid increase. More connected devices result in bigger challenges in terms of scalability, maintainability and most importantly security especially when it comes to 5G networks. The security aspect of IoT devices is an infant field, which is why it is our focus in this paper. Multiple IoT device manufacturers do not consider securing the devices they produce for different reasons like cost reduction or to avoid using energy-harvesting components. Such potentially malicious devices might be exploited by the adversary to do multiple harmful attacks. Therefore, we developed a system that can recognize malicious behavior of a specific IoT node on the network. Through convolutional neural network and monitoring, we were able to provide malware detection for IoT using a central node that can be installed within the network. The achievement shows how such models can be generalized and applied easily to any network while clearing out any stigma regarding deep learning techniques."

Software defined networks (SDNs) are becoming indispensable in managing several aspects of next-generation IoT networking that arise from the need to control highly heterogeneous, geographically dispersed, mobile IoT devices. One such aspect is cache management at the edge. Recently, multiple forms of edge resources, including mobile device clouds and micro-edge data centers have emerged to provide scalable cache placement locations that reduce the costs for the mobile network operator (MNO). As all of these service locations are registered with the MNO (or links established after registration with the 5G base station, BS), content should be placed according to the user's demand and the cost the user is willing to pay to receive the desired level of QoS. To this end, it is important to understand the future popularity of the content for its optimal placement considering the highly dynamic user mobility. In this article, we address two key aspects of a mobile IoT network: security and seamless connectivity for data delivery. We rely on the federated learning (FL) architecture, which enables harnessing data and computational capabilities at end-user devices to train machine learning models. We study FL concepts in the domain of edge computing for IoT use cases, such as caching. We draw conclusions from various state-of-the-art models and posit several challenges that can be overcome via a novel proposed control algorithm."

9089507,Blockchain-based Authentication for 5G Networks,"Fifth generation (5G) cellular network, is a promising network that provides user promising quality of services in various applications such as health, banking, education, etc. Security consideration is the most critical element facing the reliance upon this technology. Registration, authentication and key agreement protocols are considered the most important protocols in any cellular network, since the subscriber and the network trust each other and share a symmetric key. Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) developed security specifications for the user authentication with the provider. However, many researchers targeted these protocols and concluded that there are still some security issues and proposed authentication and key agreement protocols. On the other hand, blockchain is considered one of the emerging technologies that will have a great impact on our life in the coming days. Blockchain grants its security properties such as authenticity and integrity to various applications such as bitcoin, smart contracts, etc. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel, efficient and secure authentication and key agreement protocol for 5G networks using blockchain. Our security analysis illustrates that the proposed scheme is secure and withstands the known attacks; denial of service, distributed denial of service, man in the middle, hijacking and compromising attacks. Furthermore, our performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the current scheme and also other schemes since it preserves the small battery properties of the user equipment and also preserves the bandwidth of the network."

The revolution of 5G-enabled IoT supports distinct attributes, including lower latency, higher system capacity, high data rate, and energy saving. However, such revolution also delivers considerable increment in data generation that further leads to a major requirement of intelligent and effective data analytic operation across the network. Furthermore, data growth gives rise to data security and privacy concerns, such as breach and loss of sensitive data. The conventional data analytic and security methods do not meet the requirement of 5G-enabled IoT including its unique characteristic of low latency and high throughput. In this paper, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) and blockchain-empowered security framework for intelligent 5G-enabled IoT that leverages DL competency for intelligent data analysis operation and blockchain for data security. The framework's hierarchical architecture wherein DL and blockchain operations emerge across the four layers of cloud, fog, edge, and user is presented.

Besides the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, we also notice that the 5G network in itself is composed of millions of heterogeneous physical entities and nodes, multiple domains, complex protocols and technologies, different gateways, and so on. This heterogeneity imposes critical impacts on the application specific quality of service (QoS) requirements, performance and utilization of network resources, and data and user security. In order to alleviate the above impacts, researchers propose to use different technologies such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, blockchain, and artificial intelligence in 5G-enabled IoT networking. We notice that the layers over layers (of protocols and technologies) act like a plug-in over plug-in (PoP) in the network in order to accomplish various aims, including meeting QoS demands, enhancing security, load balancing, and so on. On one hand, we agree that this integration of different technologies in 5G networks bring numerous advantages, but on the other hand, we realize that this has posed a lot of unique critical issues in modern 5G network management. In this article, we point out that this straightforward approach of PoP is eventually not a healthy approach for network transformation. In this regard, using open source MANO (OSM), we provide a proof of concept (PoC) to show that at varying degrees of heterogeneity, PoP adds the delay in the VNF deployment process and further impacts the VIM CPU performance. This eventually affects the QoS requirements of IoT nodes or applications. Following this, we propose a high-level holistic approach that helps to alleviate the PoP issue. Finally, in this context, we also discuss the associated challenges and research opportunities.

9546758,"Deterministic 5G mmWave Large-Scale 3D Path Loss Model for Lagos Island, Nigeria","5G millimeter wave (mmWave) application in mobile connectivity to realize high-speed, reliable communication is attributed with high path loss. This paper presents a detailed 3D ray-tracing technique at 28 GHz for Lagos Island to investigate five unique path loss scenarios: path loss, free space path loss with antenna pattern, free space path loss without antenna pattern, excess path loss with antenna pattern, and the excess path loss without antenna pattern for an urban environment. The Close-In (CI) model, Floating Intercept (FI) path loss model, and a root mean square error (RMSE) are used to model and evaluate the best path loss model for Lagos Island. The average achieved FI (
α,β,σ
) parameters were 189.92352, 0.1654, and 0.66948, While the average CI (

) parameters were 2.309355 and 56.236425. From all the scenarios evaluated, the lowest path loss exponent achieved was 0.45, while the highest path loss exponent was 3.8. We have established that the FI path loss model accurately characterizes path loss for the Lagos Island environment with the lowest RMSE of 0.0359 dB and the highest RSME of 0.0997 dB. In contrast, the CI model over-predict the path loss at 28 GHz with the lowest RMSE of 0.0495 dB and the highest RMSE of 2.2547 dB. This work opens up a new area of research on mm-Wave at 28 GHz in Lagos Island, and the results obtained from this work can be used to benchmark future studies on mmWave in a similar environment."
9563082,Cooperative Scheduler to Enhance Massive Connectivity in 5G and Beyond by Minimizing Interference in OMA and NOMA,"The fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks introduced massive machine-type communications (mMTC) to cope with the growing demand of massive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the heterogeneous characteristics of massive IoT and diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements may lead to severe interference that could degrade the expected QoS of the cellular ecosystem. Therefore, this article studies the impact of interference caused by mMTC connections. We theoretically model the intercell interference (ICI) minimization problem for the existing orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technique and propose its corresponding solution. Furthermore, we jointly solve the ICI and the cochannel interference minimization problem for the IoT users when the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is used. For the proposed OMA and NOMA schemes, we design a cooperative scheduler to reduce the impact of such interference. The results show that our proposed schemes provide up to 58%, 75%, and 100% more improvements in terms of user’s data rates, energy consumption, and connection density, respectively."
9369611,Efficient Random Access Protocol for Multi SIM Multi Standby Devices in 5G and B5G Networks,"Multi SIM (Multi Subscriber Identity Module) Multi Standby (MSMS) feature-enabled devices have gained huge popularity among smartphone users as it offers the flexibility to use multiple SIM cards of the same or different operators on the same handheld device. To reduce cost, these MSMS devices are predominantly built with a single Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC), restricting Protocol Stack Unit (PSU) of only one SIM to communicate with the cellular network at a time. Random Access (RA) procedure in MSMS devices experiences two delays: (i) typical RACH contention time, (ii) the PSU wait time to get RFIC to transmit RA messages. IoT (Internet of Things) devices, Single SIM, and Multi SIM Multi Active (MSMA, with an equal number of SIMs and RFICs) smartphones do not have the above second delay. As a result, MSMS device with a single RFIC has to face both delays to get network access even in 5G and future networks. To improve RA performance of MSMS devices, we propose a novel algorithm called, Network Assisted Random Access for MSMS (NARAM), which enables the 5G network to estimate the prevailing congestion levels using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and reduce the first delay by tuning the network configuration appropriately. The simulation results reveal that the MSMS RA delay reduced by 8% from legacy. Furthermore, the RA failure rate of MSMS devices dropped by 23% when compared to the legacy."

9629066,Provably Secure Protocol for 5G HetNets,"The fifth generation (5G) networks exhibit high data rates and capacities that endear them to applications such as internet of things (IoT) and mobile banking. Due to sensitivity of data exchanged in these applications, security and privacy preservation schemes are essential for their deployments. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has specified evolved packet system authentication and key agreement (EPSAKA) and 5G AKA protocols for mutually authenticating the communicating entities. However, these protocols are vulnerable to attacks such as impersonation, denial of service (DoS), hijacking and packet replays. Consequently, other schemes based on technologies such as blockchain, public key cryptography and certificates have been introduced to counter these threats. Unfortunately, these algorithms have either high computation and communication overheads or fail to effectively prevent these attacks. In this paper, a new key agreement and authentication protocol is presented. Security evaluation shows that this protocol upholds backward and forward key secrecy, and is robust against attacks such as privileged insider and privacy violations. In terms of performance, it exhibits average computation overheads compared with other related schemes."

URLLC services (i.e., autonomous vehicles, industrial Internet of Things (IoT),...) require strict latency, on-way latency of 1 ms, with 99.999% reliability. eMBB applications aims extreme data rate while mMTC is designed to serve a large number of IoT devices that send a small data sporadically. In this paper, we address the resource scheduling problem of URLLC and eMBB traffics. First, the Resource Blocks (RBs) are allocated to eMBB users at the beginning of each time slot based on the channel state of each eMBB user and his previous average data rate up to current time slot. The RBs allocation problem modeled as as a 2-Dimensions Hopfield Neural Networks (2D-HNN) and the energy function of 2D-HNN is investigated to solve the RBs allocation problem. Then, the resource scheduling problem of URLLC and eMBB is formulated as an optimization problem with chance constraint. The chance constraint based problem aims to maximize the eMBB data rate while satisfying the URLLC critical constraints. The cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the stochastic URLLC traffic is investigated to relax the chance constraint into a linear constraint. The simulation results show efficiency of the proposed dynamic scheduling approach."

8972426,An Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol for Multi-Server Architecture in 5G Networks,"Currently, the popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought about an increase in the amount of data, so multi-server distributed cloud computing has been widely used in various applications that have brought convenience to our daily lives. At the same time, the development of the fifth generation (5G) of mobile communication technology has gradually become the main driving force for the popularization of the IoT. Because the 5G network is a heterogeneous network with multiple servers and small cells, the mutual authentication protocol under multiple servers is also applicable to the 5G network environment. However, much of the data will have serious storage and security issues during transmission. Aiming at the security issues in a multi-server (M-S) architecture, in 2018, Wu et al. proposed an authentication protocol in a distributed cloud environment. They claimed that their protocol is secure and resistant to various known types of attacks. However, we found that their protocol does not guarantee perfect forward secrecy (PFS) and suffers from privileged insider (PI) attacks. Such attacks will cause data to be out of sync. Therefore, we improved Wu et al.'s protocol and proposed an improvement in the 5G network environment. Finally, we performed a security analysis on the proposed protocol, including the automatic encryption protocol tool ProVerif, BAN logic, and informal security analysis, which proved that our protocol is secure. Compared with similar existing schemes, we have proved the efficiency of the scheme and achieved higher security standards."

9685776,An LSTM-based Approach for Holdover Clock Disciplining in IEEE 1588 PTP Applications,"This paper discusses the application of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to maintain the synchronization of a real-time clock in holdover operation, that is, while the timing reference input of the clock is unavailable. The approach trains the LSTM network based on timestamps acquired while the slave clock is locked to its reference input coming from a master clock. When the slave clock loses its reference and enters holdover mode, the LSTM takes over and controls the clock. We evaluate the method on a testbed consisting of IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) clocks based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), where we collect nanosecond-accurate timestamps for offline analysis. We evaluate two oscillator stability scenarios: when the PTP clocks rely on oven-controlled crystal oscillators (OCXOs) and when they use crystal oscillators (XOs). In both cases, we demonstrate that the algorithm can sustain the clock synchronization accuracy within reasonable limits over intervals of 1000 seconds in two different temperature scenarios."

In the future factory, production machines, and environmental monitoring devices will be endowed with the wireless connecting for mobility. These devices are deployed for running complicated real-time tasks. To make such mission-critical tasks being processed in time, parts of the tasks should be completed with the assistance of the edge server or even the cloud. In this work, we jointly investigate the partial task offloading, computation, and communication (licensed and unlicensed) resource allocation problem in the trade-off between overall power consumption and quality of service (QoS) satisfaction. A 2-tier MEC-cloud framework is provided, wherein the IoT mobile devices (MDs) are able to partition the tasks into segments and offload them to the MEC and the cloud server.

9064596,Leveraging Dynamic Stackelberg Pricing Game for Multi-Mode Spectrum Sharing in 5G-VANET,"5G enabled Vehicular ad hoc network (5G-VANET) plays a promising role to support diverse intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications. There are three types of communication modes in 5G-VANET: cellular mode, reuse mode and dedicated mode, i.e., vehicle users (VUEs) communicate with each other using the cellular network spectrum directly, in an underlay sharing way, and utilizing the allocated dedicated spectrum, respectively. However, how to dynamically share the multi-mode spectrum to optimize the network performance (i.e., network throughput) in 5G-VANET is a challenging task due to the high dynamic VANET environment and network resource heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Stackelberg pricing game enabled multi-mode spectrum sharing solution in 5G-VANET. In specific, we develop an access price strategy for different spectrum sharing modes considering the cellular BS's revenue and whole network throughput, while VUEs can select communication modes in a distributed way and dynamically change the selections through an evolutionary game.

Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) can enhance the ability of emerging resource-intensive IoT applications and has attracted much attention. However, due to the time-varying network environments, as well as the heterogeneous resources of network devices, it is hard to achieve stable, reliable, and real-time interactions between edge devices and their serving edge servers, especially in the 5G ultradense network (UDN) scenarios. Ultradense edge computing (UDEC) has the potential to fill this gap, especially in the 5G era, but it still faces challenges in its current solutions, such as the lack of: 1) efficient utilization of multiple 5G resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage, and service resources); 2) low overhead offloading decision making and resource allocation strategies; and 3) privacy and security protection schemes. Thus, we first propose an intelligent UDEC (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) into 5G UDEC networks. Then, in order to achieve real-time and low overhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies, we design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (2Ts-DRL) approach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process, respectively. The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay and network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation, and service caching placement. We also leverage federated learning (FL) to train the 2Ts-DRL model in a distributed manner, aiming to protect the edge devices' data privacy. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of both the 2Ts-DRL and FL in the I-UDEC framework and prove that our proposed algorithm can reduce task execution time ...

Edge service providers (ESP) are responsible for serving edge users or IoT devices running latency-critical applications. An MEC server provides faster response to ESPs but has limited computation resources, hence, it can be overloaded due to extensive resource demand. Thus, federation of multiple MEC servers offers an opportunity for dynamic resource allocation in a distributed manner. The federation objective is to maximize the usage of underutilized edge resources and reduction of service provision time simultaneously. As all the ESPs and MECs act autonomously, it is quite impossible for all the individuals to achieve optimal behavior simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a Stackelberg Game (
SBG
) based dynamic resource allocation method to reach the expected performance. The
SBG
analyzes the pricing of MECs and the resource-purchasing problem of ESPs. We also develop a many-to-many matching algorithm for resource sharing among the MECs and a one-to-many matching algorithm for that between an MEC server and ESPs. The results from an extensive performance evaluation demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed system in increasing utilities for MECs and ESPs, reducing the turnaround time of application tasks, and ensuring fair resource distribution compared to state-of-the-art works."

9406015,"URLLC for 5G and Beyond: Requirements, Enabling Incumbent Technologies and Network Intelligence","The tactile internet (TI) is believed to be the prospective advancement of the internet of things (IoT), comprising human-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication. TI focuses on enabling real-time interactive techniques with a portfolio of engineering, social, and commercial use cases. For this purpose, the prospective 5 th generation (5G) technology focuses on achieving ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) services. TI applications require an extraordinary degree of reliability and latency. The 3 rd generation partnership project (3GPP) defines that URLLC is expected to provide 99.99% reliability of a single transmission of 32 bytes packet with a latency of less than one millisecond. 3GPP proposes to include an adjustable orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique, called 5G new radio (5G NR), as a new radio access technology (RAT). Whereas, with the emergence of a novel physical layer RAT, the need for the design for prospective next-generation technologies arises, especially with the focus of network intelligence. In such situations, machine learning (ML) techniques are expected to be essential to assist in designing intelligent network resource allocation protocols for 5G NR URLLC requirements. Therefore, in this survey, we present a possibility to use the federated reinforcement learning (FRL) technique, which is one of the ML techniques, for 5G NR URLLC requirements and summarizes the corresponding achievements for URLLC. We provide a comprehensive discussion of MAC layer channel access mechanisms that enable URLLC in 5G NR for TI. Besides, we identify seven very critical future use cases of FRL as potential enablers for URLLC in 5G NR."

Most of the existing systems are failed to provide a secure management and maintenance of passing emergency information to the worker during risk conditions with the coverage of wi-fi technology. Data communication through radio wave is not possible on far end of subversive mines because asymmetrical data proliferation and inadequate rate of recurrence scope 3 kHz - 300 GHz. Most injuries taking place in subversive mines include rock falls, omissions, and bangs. The mining confinements remain pretentious by lung sickness due to inhaling dust and toxic gas, which are emitted from mining environment.

Simulations show that SNC can evaluate the system delay under different distributions effectively. For the condition that numerous UEs access simultaneously following the Beta distribution, we first propose an improved K-means algorithm to cluster the NB-IoT terminals.

In this context, we investigate how 5G can help the development of federated learning. Network slicing, another key feature of 5G, allows running multiple isolated networks on the same physical infrastructure. However, security remains the main concern in the context of virtualization, multi-tenancy and high device density.

Future power grid will rely heavily on smart devices based on the IoT concept. As the 5G standard matures and is put into commercial use, the green interconnected 5G mobile network has shown great potential. With 5G network slicing technology, a wireless private network can be virtualized for each industry to better meet the requirements of smart grid security, reliability and flexibility. Considering the differentiated service characteristics of the smart grid and the challenges of flexibility and adaptability of the communication platform, this paper aims to solve the resource allocation problem of the radio access network (RAN) slice of smart grid. Since the type of service arrival of smart grid is unknown and lacks prior knowledge, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to conduct this research.

Indeed, data aggregators can complement cellular base stations and process IoT traffic to reduce network congestion. In this paper, we consider using mobile data aggregators, e.g., drones, that collect IoT traffic and aggregate them to the network. Specifically, we first discuss how the spectrum can be shared between cellular users (UEs) and IoT devices in the presence of drones, proposing a time-division duplexing protocol. We use stochastic geometry to analyze this protocol, comparing it to the standard spectrum sharing and orthogonal allocation protocols. We then formulate a stochastic optimization problem to optimize the nominal IoT transmit power, maximizing the average energy-efficiency (EE) of the IoT device subject to interference constraints to protect UEs. Simulations are presented to validate the theoretical insights and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. It is shown that using drones, to aggregate IoT traffic, improves the EE of IoT devices, yet the EE degrades as their altitudes increases. Equally important, optimizing the transmit power is critical to further improve the EE, while ensuring fair coexistence with UEs."

To do so, we analyze two lightweight authentication protocols, present a DoS attack inspired by users' misbehavior and suggest a solution called received signal strength, which is easy to compute, applicable for resisting against different kinds of vulnerabilities in Internet protocols, and feasible for practical implementations. We implement it on two scenarios for locating attackers, investigate the effects of IoT devices' internal error on locating, and propose an optimization problem to finding the exact location of attackers, which is efficiently solvable for computational intelligence algorithms, such as TLBO.

9173588,Parallel Genetic Algorithm to Extend the Lifespan of Internet of Things in 5G Networks,"With the development and popularization of 5G networks, the coverage problem of the Internet of Things (IoT) will encounter the massive-node problem. In this paper, we design a parallel genetic algorithm that divides the coverage problem of IoTs with massive nodes into many small problems and then solves these problems using Hadoop in parallel. First, the algorithm uses partitioning and grouping operations to degrade the scale of a large IoT and makes the coverage problem solvable. The algorithm then adopts the multi-objective programming-based genetic algorithm (MPGA) to solve the coverage problem. MPGA uses the fast non-dominated sorting to optimize the IoT coverage and node redundancy; it implements the preferential selection of non-critical nodes to maximize the length of the configuration sequence of working nodes.

To achieve nanosecond power flipping, the converter utilizes a double adaptive bound (DAB) hysteretic control to improve load transient performance. A synchronized dc resistance offset cancellation scheme is naturally embedded to enhance load regulation accuracy while retaining fixed frequency operation. The controller circuit can be easily reconfigured to achieve a power scalable operation, which facilitates the converter with adaptive system power delivery capability to achieve high efficiency over a wide power range. An integrated circuit prototype is fabricated using a 180-nm CMOS process with an active die area of 0.175 mm 2 , achieving a peak power density of 14.3 W/mm 2 . In response to 1 A/3 ns load increase/decrease between zero and maximum power, it achieves 1% settling time of 247 ns/387 ns with 31 mV/60 mV voltage droop, respectively. With a nominal switching frequency of 10 MHz, the switching frequency variations are controlled below 0.1% despite of the use of a hysteretic control.

9078003,Non-Centralised and Non-GPS Navigation Mechanism using IoT sensors: challenges and trade-offs,"In this paper, we propose a non-centralised navigation setup framework using the ubiquitous IoT sensor nodes as landmarks for non-GPS navigation where GPS or cellular coverage is poor or non-existent. Navigation will not require central control like legacy cellular networks but the IoT nodes can communicate among themselves. Such scenarios may arise in dense urban landscape and forest regions where device to device communication can enable navigation. These IoT sensors for navigation purposes will be referred to as navigation anchor points (NAP). When a navigation request arrives, these NAPs send distance information to the hand-held device of the requester. This hand-held device runs a computationally inexpensive shortest path algorithm to find out the NAPs between the source and the destination. The NAPs estimate the distances between themselves by using the received signal strength when they exchange beacon packets. The distance estimation between these NAPs can be plagued by measurement noise due to the multi-path effect. Measurement noise can be reduced by increasing the number of beacon packets used to measure the signal strength or by changing the transmission power. In this paper, we conducted simulations with a variable number of beacon packets and power and include all types of wireless channel conditions. We argued that radio clutter can change without any notice due to objects, humans and change in vegetation. Therefore it is necessary to run navigation setup every time a request arrives and not rely on a fixed set of NAPs for a source-destination pair. These NAPs are mostly battery operated and therefore, energy conservation for an extended period of operation is necessary. Hence we can see a trade-off between the accuracy of the number of NAPs used in navigation to the energy used in setting up the navigation path. This paper has explored the possibility of using the non-GPS non-centralised navigation scheme in scenarios where there is inadequate satel...

Specifically, we build the first formal model of the 5G EAP-TLS authentication protocol in the applied pi calculus, and perform an automated security analysis of the formal protocol model by using the ProVerif model checker. Our analysis results show that there are some subtle flaws in the current protocol design that may compromise the claimed security objectives. To this end, we also propose and verify a possible fix that is able to mitigate these flaws. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough formal analysis of the 5G EAP-TLS authentication protocol."

In order to answer three questions of slicing: how to express, how much is its size and the what is the number limit of the slices, we propose a wireless network slicing method based on equivalent bandwidth, which maps the user rate, power level and space division gain of MIMO into the frequency domain. Then, the system can slice the 5G wireless network resources according to the equivalent bandwidth required by users in different service classes."
8960276,IoT-KEEPER: Detecting Malicious IoT Network Activity Using Online Traffic Analysis at the Edge,"IoT devices are notoriously vulnerable even to trivial attacks and can be easily compromised. In addition, resource constraints and heterogeneity of IoT devices make it impractical to secure IoT installations using traditional endpoint and network security solutions. To address this problem, we present IoT-Keeper, a lightweight system which secures the communication of IoT. IoT-Keeper uses our proposed anomaly detection technique to perform traffic analysis at edge gateways. It uses a combination of fuzzy C-means clustering and fuzzy interpolation scheme to analyze network traffic and detect malicious network activity. Once malicious activity is detected, IoT-Keeper automatically enforces network access restrictions against IoT device generating this activity, and prevents it from attacking other devices or services. We have evaluated IoT-Keeper using a comprehensive dataset, collected from a real-world testbed, containing popular IoT devices. Using this dataset, our proposed technique achieved high accuracy (≈0.98) and low false positive rate (≈0.02) for detecting malicious network activity. Our evaluation also shows that IoT-Keeper has low resource footprint, and it can detect and mitigate various network attacks-without requiring explicit attack signatures or sophisticated hardware."

9299471,Efficient and Privacy Preserving Video Transmission in 5G-Enabled IoT Surveillance Networks: Current Challenges and Future Directions,"Vision sensors in Internet of Things (IoT)-connected smart cities play a vital role in the exponential growth of video data, thereby making its analysis and storage comparatively tough and challenging. Those sensors continuously generate data for 24 hours, which requires huge storage resources, dedicated networks for sharing with data centers, and most importantly, it makes browsing, retrieval, and event searching a difficult and time-consuming job. Video summarization (VS) is a promising direction toward a solution to these problems by analyzing the visual contents acquired from a vision sensor and prioritizing them based on events, saliency, person's appearance, and so on. However, the current VS literature still lacks focus on resource-constrained devices that can summarize data over the edge and upload it to data repositories efficiently for instant analysis. Therefore, in this article, we carry out a survey of functional VS methods to understand their pros and cons for resource-constrained devices, with the ambition to provide a compact tutorial to the community of researchers in the field. Further, we present a novel saliency-aware VS framework, incorporating 5G-enabled IoT devices, which keeps only important data, thereby saving storage resources and providing representative data for immediate exploration. Keeping privacy of data as a second priority, we intelligently encrypt the salient frames over resource-constrained devices before transmission over the 5G network. The reported experimental results show that our proposed framework has additional benefits of faster transmission (1.8~13.77 percent frames of a lengthy video are considered for transmission), reduced bandwidth, and real-time processing compared to state-of-the-art methods in the field."

Multiple IoT data streams will need to be securely processed concurrently in such networks with automated consensus processing before being recorded in blockchain ledgers across stakeholders. This paper describes the design, implementation, and performance analysis of a quantum-safe consensus processing system for such data streams. The proposed consensus system, DistC, could be instantiated with a varying number of consensus nodes that can be selected dynamically in emerging virtualized realization of blockchain and IoT data processing systems. DistC utilizes hierarchical consensus with an intra-node consensus for validating endorsements and policies associated with transactions followed by a distributed inter-node consensus across nodes in the blockchain system. A small number of nodes are selected for inter-node consensus to enhance trust and provide fault tolerance in the system while minimizing the energy required for consensus processing in virtualized infrastructure. Performance results with respect to delay and throughput are studied for both intra-node validation and inter-node consensus for 3 different elliptic curves of increasing complexity."

To be in line with the vision of future smart rail communications, the rail transport industry needs to develop innovative communication network architectures and key technologies that ensure high-quality transmissions for both passengers and railway operations and control systems. Under high mobility and with safety, eco-friendliness, comfort, transparency, predictability, and reliability. Fifth-generation (5G) technologies could be a promising solution to dealing with the design challenges on high reliability and high throughput for HSR communications.

9027476,Joint Control and Shared Channel Scheduling for Downlink in 3GPP Narrowband-IoT,"Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a low power wide area network technology introduced by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in Release 13 specifications. The NB-IoT aims at providing cellular connectivity to low cost, low throughput, delay-tolerant devices, and hence, is a key technology for smart connected living. The NB-IoT specifications continue to evolve as part of 5G New Radio (NR), and the technology is expected to co-exist with 5G NR. A transmission bandwidth of 180 KHz is required to deploy the NB-IoT. In NB-IoT, the duration of the physical downlink control channel (NPDCCH) and the physical downlink shared channel (NPDSCH) changes dynamically. When the base station broadcasts the NPDCCH region, all the active NB-IoT devices try to decode it. Hence, to reduce the power consumption of the NB-IoT devices, more number of NB-IoT devices have to be scheduled in each scheduling attempt. For each payload in NPDCCH, there is a respective payload in NPDSCH. Thus, a base station should schedule the devices simultaneously in both NPDCCH and NPDSCH to reduce the resource wastage. The time-frequency resources in NB-IoT are limited and valuable. Further, the NB-IoT devices have low battery power constraint. Thus, scheduling the devices by considering the above constraints has a significant impact on the NB-IoT system performance. Motivated by this, we propose a joint scheduling algorithm for both NPDCCH and NPDSCH. We also define performance metrics to evaluate the impact of the proposed scheduler. With system-level simulations, we show that the proposed scheduler significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms."

Existing models on AoI remain primitive and do not consider state-of-the-art transmission technologies such as 5G. They also fail to consider the impact of dynamic channel conditions. In this paper, we present Kronos, a 5G-compliant AoI scheduling algorithm that can cope with highly dynamic channel conditions. Kronos is capable of performing RB allocation and selecting MCS for each source node based on channel conditions, with the objective of minimizing long-term AoI. To meet the stringent real-time requirement for 5G, we propose a GPU-based implementation of Kronos on low-cost offthe-shelf GPUs. Through simulations and experiments, we show that Kronos can find near-optimal AoI scheduling solutions in sub-millisecond time scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 5G-compliant real-time AoI scheduler that can cope with dynamic channel conditions."

With the increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it is expected that the number of real-time time-series data streams will increase at a fast pace, making forecasting essential for the proactive successful management of the network. In this article, we discuss to use both linear and non-linear forecasting methods, including machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks to improve 5G networks’ management. For this purpose, we design and implement a real-time distributed forecasting framework, used to make simultaneous predictions of different network performance metrics, and with different learning algorithms. By using our framework, we compare the use of forecasting methods in two network scenarios, in a real vehicular network and in a 4G network, representing two different slices in a 5G network. We also integrate our framework in a 5G architecture. Using the best forecasting models assessed previously, we propose a dynamic threshold algorithm for multi-slice management, to ensure that the resources of each slice are updated according to the slices’ needs, while avoiding congestion and saving resources for other slices. The experimental results show that it is possible to forecast the slices’ needs and congestion probability, selecting the best forecasting approach or an ensemble of the best ones, and act accordingly in the network to optimize its management."

8732936,Enhanced Deployment Strategy for the 5G Drone-BS Using Artificial Intelligence,"The use of drones to perform various task has recently gained a lot of attention. Drones have been used by traders to deliver goods to customers, scientists, and researchers to observe and search for endangered species, and by the military during critical operations. The flexibility of drones in remote controlling makes them ideal candidates to perform critical tasks with minimum time and cost.

9342683,DAFNA: Decentralized Auction based Fog Node Allocation in 5G Era,"IoT applications such as smart city, smart healthcare, m-learning, m-tourism, augmented reality etc. require distributed edge computing technologies such as fog computing, mobile edge computing (MEC), cloudlet etc., to handle delay-sensitive applications. These applications are not feasible without 5G technologies because they need high-speed communication and the number of their users is also very large. In fog computing, fog nodes are allocated to the IoT users for running their heavy jobs. Many variants of a centralized reverse auction are reported in the literature for allocation of fog nodes. However, these auction methods have some major drawbacks such as one-point failure, utilization of only winner's resources in a single round of auction, and a large number of message exchanges among participating entities in auction. Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a Decentralized Auction based Fog Node Allocation mechanism (DAFNA) that inherits all the properties of a traditional auction as well as improves the utilization of fog resources. In DAFNA, the concept of contention window and waiting time is used that makes the auction decentralized in nature. DAFNA allows fog resource providers to participate in more than one auction simultaneously for the same resource that improves the utilization of the resource. In addition, DAFNA also reduces the number of message exchanges among participating entities in auction in comparison with traditional auction. A case study is given to show the working of the proposed auction. The proposed auction mechanism is an application of 5G because it is decentralized in nature and requires speedy communication among participating entities."
9579393,Security Function Virtualization for IoT Applications in 6G Networks,"One of the important characteristics envisioned for 6G is security function virtualization (SFV). Similar to network function virtualization (NFV) in 5G networks, SFV provides new opportunities for improving security while reducing the security overhead. In particular, it provides an attractive way of solving compatibility issues related to security. Malware in Internet of Things (IoT) systems is gaining popularity among cyber-criminals because of the expected number of IoT devices in 5G and 6G networks. To solve this issue, this article proposes a security framework that exploits softwarization of security functions via SFV to improve trust in IoT systems and contain the propagation of malware. IoT devices are categorized into trusted, vulnerable, and compromised levels using remote attestation. To isolate the devices in the three distinct categories, NFV is used to create separate networks for each category, and a distributed ledger is used to store the state of each device. Virtualized remote attestation routines are employed to avoid any compatibility issues among heterogeneous IoT devices and effectively contain malware propagation. The results show that the proposed framework can reduce the number of infected devices by 66 percent in only 10 seconds."

9386257,Task Allocation Framework For Software-Defined Fog v-RAN,"The fifth-generation wireless technology (5G) has been developed with an aim to provide ubiquitous and scalable connectivity for Internet-of-Things (IoT) nodes. Likewise, the cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture can be exploited to enable efficient network access to IoT nodes. Nevertheless, the 5G C-RAN architecture is based on large data centers geographically located far apart, which introduces an inevitable overhead. Therefore, to supply real-time data services near by the data terminals, fog computing emerges as a promising solution. However, constrained physical fog resources and delay-sensitive services hinder the application of new virtualization technologies in the baseband unit (BBU) task allocation management of the fog network. To tackle these challenges, a task allocation framework for hierarchical software-defined fog virtual radio access networks (v-RANs) is proposed in this article. Precisely, we apply an enhanced ant colony optimization (ACO) in combination with a max-min algorithm to efficiently determine the optimal path for BBU task allocation management, while minimizing the transmission time for parallel task execution scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that the queue delay in our approach is 98.38% and 98.82% lower than the round-robin (RR) algorithm and least connection technique (LCT), respectively."

Similar to 5G NR networks, the presented schemes are using the beam-forming technique to serve the cellular user equipments (CUEs), at the same time, and via the same frequency band. In addition, they serve a number of D2D UEs (DUEs), by using different access methods. The first scheme is using a guard zone technique to prevent interference problems at the CUEs and the D2D UEs (DUEs). The second transmission scheme can be used in the scenarios, where a big number of D2D communications is needed, e.g., internet of things (IoT) applications, local service, emergency communications. In this scheme, the CUEs and the DUEs are using different bands to prevent the interference problems, and to increase the number of connected DUEs. To evaluate the performance of the different schemes under consideration, and based on stochastic geometry tools, we derive the corresponding expressions of the probability of using the D2D mode, and the sum-rate of all the connected UEs. Based on conducted simulation results, the derived expressions are evaluated, and the performances of the different schemes are investigated."
8944569,A Construction of Security Enhanced and Efficient Handover AKA Protocol in 5G Communication Network,"In order to accommodate the increasing security demands of Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has announced the Fifth Generation (5G) communication technology with the security amendments such as flexible placement of User Plane (UP) functions and network slicing which were not achieved in Fourth Generation (4G) Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. In this paper, we identified the security weaknesses in existing 5G handover protocol such as false base-station attack, lack of Key forward/backward secrecy (KFS/KBS), Denial of Service (DoS) attack, and high network complexity. In order to modify the above issues, we construct a security enhanced and efficient handover authentication and key agreement protocol in 5th generation communication network. The formal analysis of proposed protocol is carried out by AVISPA tool to prove its correctness. Finally, the performance evaluation of the protocol is shown with existing 5G handover protocol. The analysis shows that the proposed protocol has improved results in terms of communication and computation overhead."

In this paper, we investigate the planning process for a 5G radio access network having mmWave Micro Remote Radio Units (mRRUs) on top of sub-6 GHz Macro Remote Radio Units (MRRUs). We rely on proper channel models and link budgets as well as Urban Macro-cells (UMa) and Urban Micro-cells (UMi) characteristics to carefully formulate a 5G network planning optimization problem. We aim to jointly determine the minimum number of MRRUs and mRRUs to install and find their locations in a given geographical area while fulfilling coverage and user traffic demand constraints. In order to solve this planning process, we propose a two-step process where we first employ a low complexity meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize the locations of RRUs followed by an iterative elimination method to remove redundant cells. To evaluate the performances of this proposed approach, we conduct a comparative study using Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing. Simulations results using sub-6 GHz UMa and 28 GHz UMi demonstrate the ability of the proposed planning approach to achieve more than 98% coverage with minimum cell capacity outage rate, not exceeding the 2%, for different scenarios and illustrate the efficiency of the evolutionary algorithms in solving this NP-hard problem in reasonable running time."

9432660,5G Network Slice - A URLLC Resource Allocation Perspective,"The fifth generation wireless network, known as 5G, is the first network that was considered to meet some requirements to help IoT become a reality. 5G is also envisioned as a network that will support a diverse set of performance and service requirements and help create a wide range of vertical markets. One of the main facilitators of 5G that will provide such flexibility is slicing a single physical network into multiple isolated logical networks, each with different requirements. Different technologies have been studied to make it possible to create this end-to-end network on demand, such as Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Cloud Computing. However, allocating enough resources to guarantee the desired QoS for specific services even when this virtual network fails remains forgotten by the literature.

NOMA has been identified as a promising technology to accommodate a large number of devices using a limited number of radio resources. In this work, the objective is to maximize the number of served devices while allocating their transmission powers such that their real-time requirements as well as their limited operating energy are respected. First, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that can be transformed to MILP for some special cases. Second, we study its NP-hardness in different cases. Then, by dividing the problem into multiple NOMA grouping and scheduling subproblems, an efficient online competitive algorithm is proposed to solve each subproblem. Next, we show how to use the proposed online algorithm as a black box and how to combine the obtained solutions to each subproblem in a reinforcement learning setting to obtain the power allocation for each NOMA group. Our analyses are supplemented by simulation results to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison to optimal and state-of-the-art methods."
9385374,5G Embraces Satellites for 6G Ubiquitous IoT: Basic Models for Integrated Satellite Terrestrial Networks,"Terrestrial communication networks mainly focus on users in urban areas but have poor coverage performance in harsh environments, such as mountains, deserts, and oceans. Satellites can be exploited to extend the coverage of terrestrial fifth-generation networks. However, satellites are restricted by their high latency and relatively low data rate. Consequently, the integration of terrestrial and satellite components has been widely studied to take advantage of both sides and enable the seamless broadband coverage. Due to the significant differences between satellite communications (SatComs) and terrestrial communications (TerComs) in terms of channel fading, transmission delay, mobility, and coverage performance, the establishment of an efficient hybrid satellite-terrestrial network (HSTN) still faces many challenges. In general, it is difficult to decompose an HSTN into a sum of separate satellite and terrestrial links due to the complicated coupling relationships therein. To uncover the complete picture of HSTNs, we regard the HSTN as a combination of basic cooperative models that contain the main traits of satellite-terrestrial integration but are much simpler and thus more tractable than the large-scale heterogeneous HSTNs. In particular, we present three basic cooperative models, i.e., model X, model L, and model V, and provide a survey of the state-of-the-art technologies for each of them. We discuss future research directions toward establishing a cell-free, hierarchical, decoupled HSTN. We also outline open issues to envision an agile, smart, and secure HSTN for the sixth-generation ubiquitous Internet of Things."

In particular, the need for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) for many Internet of Things (IoT) users is greatly emphasized. In this article, we discuss some fundamental issues that relate to URLLC and present a new spread spectrum signaling design that we propose for transmission of Scheduling Requests (SRs) in 5G NR networks. The proposed design, although a Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) technique, is compatible with the OFDM signaling in LTE, hence, it can be easily integrated into LTE UE transmitter structures. Furthermore, it can be easily synchronized with the rest of an LTE network. In this paper, we propose a DSSS signal design that transmits a single bit for each scheduling request. We also propose a novel method that allows reliable detection of a UE signal when large portions of its spectrum are cluttered by other communications within the same cell."

9657146,Enabling Delay-Sensitive IoT Application by Programmable Local 5G Edge,"IoT services collect sensor and multimedia data from edge devices for capturing the status of the physical world. Delay-sensitive traffic, especially for monitoring and controlling the edge devices, should be transferred and processed in a priority manner even if congestion in the network occurs because of the system resource sharing with data-intensive and delay-tolerant traffic. A local 5G system is promising for achieving delay-sensitive IoT services because it enables the local 5G operator to control the programmable local 5G system and service level by themselves. But it isn’t easy to install novel congestion control protocols to the non-programmable system components other than the local 5G system, such as proprietary IoT devices and wide-area networks operated by network carriers. Our contribution is three-fold: First, we propose a traffic control method for delay-sensitive IoT services installed only in 5G UPF or edge routers in DN without modifying IoT devices or controlling the wide-area network. It controls the latency of delay-sensitive traffic by classifying the delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant traffic, adding delays to, and modifying the receive window size in the packets of the delay-tolerant traffic. Second, we propose an implementation architecture for the programmable Whitebox switches utilizing BPF/XDP functionality. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method. The evaluation result shows that our proposed method keeps the latency of delay-sensitive traffic within the required latency for single and multiple Local 5G locations that share the obscure wide-area network."

Children, aged people and physically disabled people will be benefitted most if they face any medical emergency situation inside a self-driving smart car. The proposed system will quickly response in any emergency situations and alert the passengers, nearby hospitals and controllers in terms of self-driving taxies. We strongly believe that using our proposed healthcare monitoring system inside a self-driving smart car in 5G will significantly help to gain trust of customers and increase profits for automobile business organizations."

The antenna structure contains two planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) elements having the same shapes. Each antenna element has two feeding plates placed at the right angle to each other to make them cross-polarized for the exploitation of polarization diversity, whereas spatial diversity is employed by positioning two antennas diagonally on opposite sides of the antenna structure. For reducing mutual coupling, the etching of rectangular slots on each side of the ground plane beneath the top plate of each element has been done to stop the flow of current between two ports of the same antenna element. Maximum isolation achieved among ports is less than -25 dB, and envelope correlation coefficient is below 0.009 in bands of interest. The minimum frequency range covered by the four ports of this antenna is from around 2.7 to 3.6 GHz for S 11 <; -10 dB, thus covering expected future 5G band (3300-3600 MHz), and may be used for small portable and handheld the IoT and cellular applications as a diversity/MIMO antenna."

9408609,Scalable and QoS-Aware Resource Allocation to Heterogeneous Traffic Flows in 5G,"Networks of new generations are increasingly involved in transporting heterogeneous flows. Indeed, in addition to the usual data and multimedia traffic, the Internet of Things (IoT) smart applications are creating new traffic types and relationships involving billions of active nodes like sensors and actuators. This traffic raises a problem of scale, particularly for resource management and decision-making mechanisms. The present work addresses for the first time the joint problem of mapping heterogeneous flows from multiple users and applications to transport blocks, and then packing these blocks into the rectangular grid of time–frequency resources within a flexible 5G new radio frame. Our solution is based on a quality-of-service-based classification of flows followed by an offline construction of two databases. The first one enumerates all possible configurations of transport blocks and the second enumerates all possible configurations of frames. Thus, the sole online processing that remains to be done is to find the optimal block configurations that satisfy a given request vector. Hence, the resolution of this complex joint mapping and packing problem is reduced to a simple resolution of a linear problem, which consists in finding the best configurations. A thorough numerical study shows that our configuration-based solution can map, within few tens of milliseconds, more than 100 flow connections to transport blocks incurring only 3% of overallocation, and then pack these blocks into the grid leading to an upper bound on the optimality gap as low as 2.8%."

9199859,Towards 5G-Enabled Self Adaptive Green and Reliable Communication in Intelligent Transportation System,"Fifth generation (5G) technologies have become the center of attention in managing and monitoring high-speed transportation system effectively with the intelligent and self-adaptive sensing capabilities. Besides, the boom in portable devices has witnessed a huge breakthrough in the data driven vehicular platform. However, sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices are playing the major role as edge nodes in the intelligent transportation system (ITS). Thus, due to high mobility/speed of vehicles and resource-constrained nature of edge nodes more data packets will be lost with high power drain and shorter battery life. Thus, this research significantly contributes in three ways. First, 5G-based self-adaptive green (i.e., energy efficient) algorithm is proposed. Second, a novel 5G-driven reliable algorithm is proposed. Proposed joint energy efficient and reliable approach contains four layers, i.e., application, physical, networks, and medium access control. Third, a novel joint energy efficient and reliable framework is proposed for ITS. Moreover, the energy and reliability in terms of received signal strength (RSSI) and hence packet loss ratio (PLR) optimization is performed under the constraint that all transmitted packets must utilize minimum transmission power with high reliability under particular active time slot. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach (with Cross Layer) significantly obtains the green (55%) and reliable (41%) ITS platform unlike the Baseline (without Cross Layer) for aging society."

In particular, mobile networks contribute most to this predicted increase in traffic and have a heavy burden on technological developments. Most of this traffic will be local with a significant burden on the access network and the metropolitan and less to the backbone network. Thus, focusing on the corresponding traffic, produced by 5G applications running in the core network, the need for data analysis and performance estimation becomes essential, in order to enhance the Validation and Verification (V&V) of different Network Services (NS) across heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, we are focusing on the analysis of the monitoring data, that are produced by the running Network Services (NSs), over a Software Defined Network (SDN).

9045401,MOTH- Mobility-induced Outages in THz: A Beyond 5G (B5G) application,"5G will enable the growing demand for Internet of Things (IoT), high-resolution video streaming, and low latency wireless services. Demand for such services is expected to growth rapid, which will require a search for Beyond 5G technological advancements in wireless communications. Part of these advancements is the need for additional spectrum, namely moving toward the terahertz (THz) range. To compensate for the high path loss in THz, narrow beamwidths are used to improve antenna gains. However, with narrow beamwidths, even minor fluctuations in device location (such as through body movement) can cause frequent link failures due to beam misalignment. In this paper, we provide a solution to these small-scale indoor movement that result in mobility-induced outages. Like a moth randomly flutters about, Mobility-induced Outages in THz (MOTH) can be ephemeral in nature and hard to avoid. To deal with MOTH we propose two methods to predict these outage scenarios: (i) Align-After-Failure (AAF), which predicts based on fixed time margins, and (ii) Align-Before-Failure (ABF), which learns the time margins through user mobility patterns. In this paper, two different online classifiers were used to train the ABF model to predicate if a mobility-induced outage is going to occur; thereby, significantly reducing the time spent in outage scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate a relationship between optimal beamwidth and human mobility patterns. Additionally, to cater to a future with dense deployment of Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN), it is necessary that we have efficient deployment of resources (e.g., THz-APs). One solution is to maximize the user coverage for a single AP, which might be dependent on multiple parameters. We identify these parameters and observe their tradeoffs for improving user coverage through a single THz-AP."

In this work, we leverage the mobility and agility of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as mobile edge servers or cloudlets to offer computation offloading opportunities to IoT devices. In particular, we consider the joint problem of optimizing the number and positions of deployed UAV cloudlets in 3D space and task offloading decisions with cooperation among UAVs, in order to provision IoT services with strict latency requirements. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer program, and propose an efficient meta-heuristic solution based on the ions motion optimization algorithm. The performance of the meta-heuristic solution is evaluated and compared to the optimal solution as a function of various system parameters and for different application use cases. It is shown to achieve near-optimal performance with low complexity and, thus, can efficiently scale up to large IoT network scenarios."

Motivated by these challenges, this article studies the performance of cooperative simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for massive IoT systems. Under the practical assumption, residual hardware impairments (RHIs) and channel estimation errors (CEEs) are taken into account. The communication between the base station (BS) and two NOMA IoT device users is realized through a direct link and the assistance of multiple relays with finite energy storage capability that can harvest energy from the BS. Aiming at improving the system performance, an optimal relay is selected among K relays by using the partial relay selection (PRS) protocol to forward the received signal to the two NOMA IoT device users, namely, the far user (FU) and near user (NU). To evaluate the system performance, exact analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) are derived in closed form. In order to get a better understanding of the overall system performance, we further undertake diversity order analyses by deriving asymptotic expressions for the OP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In addition, we also investigate the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered system, which is a crucial performance metric in massive IoT systems so that the impact of key system parameters on the performance can be quantified. Finally, the optimal power allocation scheme to maximize the sum rate of the considered system in the high SNR regime is also designed. Numerical results have shown that: 1) hardware impairment parameter has a deleterious effect on system performance while the channel estimation parameter is always beneficial to the OP; 2) the expected performance improvements obtained by the user of PRS protocol are en...

With its dynamic deployability as a medium level cloud service, fog nodes are enabling heterogeneous service provisioning infrastructure that features scalability, interoperability, and adaptability. Out of the various 5G based services possible with the fog computing platforms, security services are imperative but minimally investigated direct live. Thus, in this research, we are focused on launching security services in a fog node with an architecture capable of provisioning on-demand service requests. As the fog nodes are constrained on resources, our intention is to integrate light-weight virtualization technology such as Docker for forming the service provisioning infrastructure. We managed to launch multiple security instances configured to be Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPSs) on the fog infrastructure emulated via a Raspberry Pi-4 device.

9097224,Dynamic Analysis for IoT Malware Detection With Convolution Neural Network Model,"Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides the basic infrastructure for a hyper connected society where all things are connected and exchange information through the Internet. IoT technology is fused with 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for use various fields such as the smart city and smart factory. As the demand for IoT technology increases, security threats against IoT infrastructure, applications, and devices have also increased. A variety of studies have been conducted on the detection of IoT malware to avoid the threats posed by malicious code. While existing models may accurately detect malicious IoT code identified through static analysis, detecting the new and variant IoT malware quickly being generated may become challenging. This paper proposes a dynamic analysis for IoT malware detection (DAIMD) to reduce damage to IoT devices by detecting both well-known IoT malware and new and variant IoT malware evolved intelligently. The DAIMD scheme learns IoT malware using the convolution neural network (CNN) model and analyzes IoT malware dynamically in nested cloud environment. DAIMD performs dynamic analysis on IoT malware in a nested cloud environment to extract behaviors related to memory, network, virtual file system, process, and system call. By converting the extracted and analyzed behavior data into images, the behavior images of IoT malware are classified and trained in the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). DAIMD can minimize the infection damage of IoT devices from malware by visualizing and learning the vast amount of behavior data generated through dynamic analysis."
9540708,Relaying in the Internet of Things (IoT): A Survey,"The deployment of relays between Internet of Things (IoT) end devices and gateways can improve link quality. In cellular-based IoT, relays have the potential to reduce base station overload. The energy expended in single-hop long-range communication can be reduced if relays listen to transmissions of end devices and forward these observations to gateways. However, incorporating relays into IoT networks faces some challenges. IoT end devices are designed primarily for uplink communication of small-sized observations toward the network; hence, opportunistically using end devices as relays needs a redesign of both the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol of such end devices and possible addition of new communication interfaces. Additionally, the wake-up time of IoT end devices needs to be synchronized with that of the relays. For cellular-based IoT, the possibility of using infrastructure relays exists, and noncellular IoT networks can leverage the presence of mobile devices for relaying, for example, in remote healthcare. However, the latter presents problems of incentivizing relay participation and managing the mobility of relays. Furthermore, although relays can increase the lifetime of IoT networks, deploying relays implies the need for additional batteries to power them. This can erode the energy efficiency gain that relays offer. Therefore, designing relay-assisted IoT networks that provide acceptable trade-offs is key, and this goes beyond adding an extra transmit RF chain to a relay-enabled IoT end device. There has been increasing research interest in IoT relaying, as demonstrated in the available literature. Works that consider these issues are surveyed in this paper to provide insight into the state of the art, provide design insights for network designers and motivate future research directions."

9490359,A Novel PUF-Based Group Authentication and Data Transmission Scheme for NB-IoT in 3GPP 5G Networks,"With the gradual commercialization of the fifth-generation (5G) network, the narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) system would have potential and prospective applications in future relying on the infrastructure. Meanwhile, predictably, there are several security requirements to be satisfied, including concurrent access authentication for massive devices, identity privacy protection, physical attack resistance, application traffic security, etc. In this article, we present a novel group authentication and data transmission scheme using the physically unclonable function (PUF) for NB-IoT in which the output of PUF is viewed as shared root key to achieve the mutual authentication along with key agreement. By this scheme, a Group Leader is employed to aggregate and relay authentication information and, thus, it reduces the signaling cost and communication cost followed by activating attach request messages from a sea of devices. The network side as well can surely find fake ones through individual truncated authentication code and detect honest devices with high probability when aggregated authentication code is invalid. Furthermore, the revised security model and the formal verification tool Scyther are employed to evaluate the security of the scheme. Finally, performance analysis results show that our solution has the desired efficiency."
9457110,Secure and Efficient Data Sharing Among Vehicles Based on Consortium Blockchain,"The large amount of driving data can help intelligent vehicles make decisions to drive safely, improve vehicular services and enhance driving experience. In traditional vehicular networks, data sharing needs to be done with roadside units (RSUs). However, RSUs cannot be entirely trusted and the data stored in the RSUs may be tampered with. In addition, the deployment of RSUs along roads consumes a large amount of social resources. Further, data sharing between vehicles lacks a trusted environment, and vehicles may be unwilling to share data with others because of data security and privacy concerns. Moreover, in the event of unauthorized data sharing, the source of the leaked data is difficult to trace. In this study, we exploit consortium blockchain technology to achieve traceable and anonymous vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data sharing, effectively preventing second-hand sharing of data. The combination of 5G and blockchain makes it possible to share data without using RSUs. We design an enhanced delegated proof-of-stake consensus algorithm to make it more suitable for applications in the distributed Internet of Vehicles (IoV). A comprehensive analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient."

9522178,An Analytical Model for Evaluating the Interplay Between Capacity and Energy Efficiency in NB-IoT,"The Narrowband Internet Of Things, better known by the acronym NB-IoT, is spearheading 3GPP’s effort to address the massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) segment of 5G. With 103 deployments in more than 40 countries, NB-IoT’s performance in terms of cell capacity and coverage is well established. However, the performance it can offer in terms of battery life, a foundational requirement of IoT, has received little attention. In this paper, we introduce the first theoretical model based on the M/D/H/K queues capable of evaluating the energy performance of NB-IoT in advanced cell scenarios defined by a coverage distribution, a payload uplink and downlink size, and an incoming communication rate. After using the values computed by 3GPP for single-terminal cells to demonstrate its accuracy, we use our model to evaluate the NB-IoT’s energy performance. Our analysis reveals that a) Early Data Transmission, originally designed for improving the latency and connection density, can also significantly improve the energy performance, and b) When the load in multi-terminal cell settings increases, the terminal battery lifetime collapses. Leveraging our model, we introduce a solution requiring no changes to the standard and show that it significantly improves the terminal battery life."
8694823,Dynamic Binary Countdown for Massive IoT Random Access in Dense 5G Networks,"Massive connectivity for Internet of Things applications is expected to challenge the way access reservation protocols are designed in 5G networks. Since the number of devices and their density are envisioned to be orders of magnitude larger, state-of-the-art access reservation, random access (RA) procedure, might be a bottleneck for end-to-end delay. This would be especially challenging for burst arrival scenarios: semi-synchronous triggering of a large number of devices due to a common event (blackout, emergency alarm, etc.). In this paper, to improve RA procedure scalability, we propose to combine binary countdown contention resolution (BCCR) with the state-of-the-art access class barring (ACB). We present a joint analysis of ACB and BCCR and apply a framework for treating RA as a bi-objective optimization, minimizing the resource consumption and maximizing the throughput of the procedure in every contention round. We use this framework to devise dynamic load-adaptive algorithm and simulatively illustrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the burst resolution delay while consuming less resources compared to the state-of-the-art techniques."

The main reasons are the security concerns and the intelligent deployment of IoT device's connectivity. But, with the upcoming 5G and the 6th generation of Wi-Fi, if the security aspects will be considered rigorously, this has direct impact on the IoT success. Thus, many standardization works to ensure IoT security have already published and recent researches have open new tracks to satisfy the IoT security concerns. In this paper, we address a new track that we believe is crucial to fulfilling the IoT security needs. It is about the use of the embedded SIM (eSIM) for IoT device secured identification. The idea is to distinguish eSIMs used for IoT services from those used for traditional services. As a result, MNO's subscriptions associated to IoT services are managed in a more secure and efficient way. We study the eSIM's security mechanisms and we arise the observed potential vulnerabilities. We propose solutions to avoid such potential vulnerabilities so that the most appropriate level of security for an IoT service will be satisfied."

The flexible deployment of these devices requires wireless connectivity which is labeled as industrial internet of things, IIoT. The sporadic activity pattern of IIoT devices naturally suggest the use of random access techniques, albeit posing new and unexplored challenges for the current wireless networks. On top of the demand for new access protocols, the latency-reliability requirements further challenge the existing random access protocols. In this work we investigate the adaptation of a well known modern random access algorithm, Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA) to IIoT in 5G New Radio. The key contribution of the paper is the proposed system level protocol, Adaptive-Multichannel IRSA, that can fulfill the latency-reliability requirements. On top of this, the definition and solution of the resource allocation problem as a resource efficiency optimization guarantees that the algorithm minimizes the system resources.

This framework can dynamically provision the IoT devices to enable machine-to-machine (M2M) communication as well as continuous operational fault detection for WSNs. Unlike the existing approaches in the literature, SDIM is mainly deployed at multiaccess edge computing (MEC) nodes and is integrated with the cloud by aggregating multidomain topology information. Backed by the experimental results over the University of Bristol 5G test network, we demonstrate in practice that our framework outperforms the implementations of the lightweight M2M (LWM2M) and NETCONF Light IoT device management protocols when deployed autonomously at the network edge and/or the cloud. Specifically, SDIM edge deployments can lower the average device provisioning time as high as 46% compared to LWM2M and 60.3% compared to NETCONF Light. Moreover, it can decrease the average operational fault detection time by approximately 33% compared to LWM2M and roughly 40% compared to NETCONF Light. Also, SDIM reduces control operations time up to 27%, posing a powerful feature for use cases with time-critical control requirements. Last, SDIM manages to both reduce CPU consumption and to have important energy consumption gains at the network edge, which can reach as high as 20% during device provisioning and 4.5%–4.9% during fault detection compared to the benchmark framework deployments."

9174831,RISMA: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Enabling Beamforming for IoT Massive Access,"Massive access for Internet-of-Things (IoT) in beyond 5G networks represents a daunting challenge for conventional bandwidth-limited technologies. Millimeter-wave technologies (mmWave)-which provide large chunks of bandwidth at the cost of more complex wireless processors in harsher radio environments-is a promising alternative to accommodate massive IoT but its cost and power requirements are an obstacle for wide adoption in practice. In this context, meta-materials arise as a key innovation enabler to address this challenge by Re-configurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). In this article we take on the challenge and study a beyond 5G scenario consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving a large set of single-antenna user equipments (UEs) with the aid of RISs to cope with non-line-of-sight paths. Specifically, we build a mathematical framework to jointly optimize the precoding strategy of the BS and the RIS parameters in order to minimize the system sum mean squared error (SMSE). This novel approach reveals convenient properties used to design two algorithms, RISMA and Lo- RISMA, which are able to either find simple and efficient solutions to our problem (the former) or accommodate practical constraints with low-resolution RISs (the latter). Numerical results show that our algorithms outperform conventional benchmarks that do not employ RIS (even with low-resolution meta-surfaces) with gains that span from 20% to 120% in sum rate performance."

9627739,SmartCon: Deep Probabilistic Learning Based Intelligent Link-Configuration in Narrowband-IoT Towards 5G and B5G,"To enhance the coverage and transmission reliability, repetitions adopted by Narrowband Internet of Things (NBIoT) allow repeating transmissions several times. However, this results in a waste of radio resources when the signal strength is high. In addition, in low signal quality, the selection of a higher modulation and coding scheme (MCS) level leads to a huge packet loss in the network. Moreover, the number of physical resource blocks (PRBs) per-user needs to be chosen dynamically, such that the utilization of radio resources can be improved on per-user basis. Therefore, in NB-IoT systems, dynamic adaptation of repetitions, MCS, and radio resources, known as auto link-configuration, is crucial. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose SmartCon which is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based deep learning approach for auto linkconfiguration during uplink or downlink scheduling, such that the packet loss rate is significantly reduced in NB-IoT networks. For the training purpose of the GAN, we use a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based reinforcement learning mechanism that intelligently tunes its output depending on the present network condition. The performance of SmartCon is thoroughly evaluated through simulations where it is shown to significantly improve the performance of NB-IoT systems compared to baseline schemes."

Billions of IoT devices in SAGS networks generate massive data to support various applications. We argue that it is crucial to construct a Collaboration Trust Interconnections System (CTIS) to provide the ubiquitous SAGS network accessibility and security. In this paper, a CTIS framework among the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Mobile Vehicles (MVs), and IoT devices is proposed to evaluate trust and select low-cost and high-trust participants to improve data quality. In this framework, MVs record the interaction information to form the verification chains, while the UAV is dispatched to collect baseline data to verify the data reported by MVs, thereby constructing global trust. Then, the hash values of baseline data are delivered to MVs to act as calibration baseline data, which provides a verification certificate for interactions among MVs and constructs local interaction trust. Finally, a greedy-based winner recruitment strategy is proposed to achieve intelligent information control with maximum credibility and cost. The simulation results show that the CTIS framework reduces the cost by 5.62%, reduces the false ratio and packet dropping rate by at least 17.16% and 31.51% compared with previous schemes."

However, attacks like Mirai, Wannacry, Stuxnet, etc. show that a cyber attack often comprises of a series of attacks on vulnerabilities of victim devices to reach the target device. Penetration testing is generally used to identify the vulnerabilities/ possible attacks on traditional systems periodically. A timely fix of these vulnerabilities can avoid future attacks. Traditional penetration testing methods focus on isolated and manual testing of a host that fails to detect attacks involving multi-hosts and multi-stages. In this paper, we introduced first-of-its-kind, IoT-PEN, a Penetration Testing Framework for IoT. The framework consists of server-client architecture with ""a system with resources"" as server and all ""IoT nodes"" as clients. IoT-PEN is an end-to-end, scalable, flexible, and automatic penetration testing framework for IoT. IoT-PEN seeks to discover all possible ways an attacker can breach the target system using target-graphs. It constructs prerequisite and postconditions for each vulnerability using the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). We also demonstrated that even if an individual system is secure under some threat model, the attacker can use a kill-chain (a sequence of exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities on different hosts) to reach the target system."
8941981,Channel Assignment and Power Control for D2D-Enabled Cellular Networks,"Device-to-Device (D2D) communication systems will be a major driver for machine-type communication (MTC) in 5G networks because of their ability to facilitate the connection of heterogeneous devices. 5G networks will feature smart environments with devices having differing Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we formulate a channel assignment and power control optimisation problem for D2D-enabled cellular networks where users have different (QoS) requirements namely high throughput for cellular users (CUEs) and low power consumption for D2D users (DUEs). We propose a resource allocation algorithm that adopts fixed-target Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) tracking for power control. In the proposed scheme, a DUE is assigned a pre-allocated cellular channel that satisfies the QoS metric of the CUE once the predefined SINR has been achieved. Numerical results show that the proposed method significantly improves CUE's throughput and DUE power savings."

Advancement of Human Driven Edge Computing (HEC) with 5 th Generation Internet services also makes this more feasible. Use of IoT and increased demand of BYOD becomes one of the fundamental needs to increase the organization employee productivity and business agility. But it increased the significant risk of the cyber-attack which is leading a major reason for business disruption and becomes a leading question about how to get a cyber secured citizenship in the smart city environment as well as in the organization where BYOD is used in large numbers. In order to conduct forensic investigation post incident detection of malicious activities from IoT/BYOD end point is most challenging task.

9740408,Communication Security Analysis of Intelligent Transportation System Using 5G Internet of Things From the Perspective of Big Data,"The transportation system has entered the era of 5G intelligent Internet of things (IoT), which can realize the comprehensive monitoring, perception, and intelligent decision-making of people, vehicles, roads, and the environment. The purpose is to solve the problems in the communication security of intelligent transportation system (ITS) and improve the vulnerability of traditional distributed architecture. The security issues of the Internet of vehicles (IoV) in 5G environment are analyzed from the perspective of big data. An access control mechanism based on risk prediction is proposed aiming at the problems existing in the node access control process. A Wasserstein Distance-based Combined Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN) is proposed. It modifies the loss function to solve the gradient disappearance problem, and a combination of multiple generators is designed to solve the pattern collapse. The simulation experiment is carried out on the dataset of the intrusion detection evaluation project. The WCGAN model has the smallest prediction error than the other models regarding the node packet transmission rate. Its loss value is close to 0 after 10 iterations, while the loss value of the BP neural network (BPNN) is about 0.28. The prediction accuracy of the WCGAN model can reach 86.3% when the training set is 5000, which is much higher than that of BPNN (77.8%). The reason is that the WCGAN model increases the number of generators according to GAN, which improves the low accuracy caused by pattern collapse. The IoT-based ITS can implement corresponding strategies according to the prediction results and control the access rights of nodes, thus ensuring the security of information resources effectively. The research content reduces the communication delay under ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information in the process of data transmission, and provides a reference for ensuring the safe communication of IoV."

To reduce the complexity of Kalman filtering, we consider a constant gain filter at the remote controller. We propose a decentralized dynamic scheduling and information fusion of the IoT sensors to stabilize the unstable dynamic plant. The proposed scheme has a state-driven multiple access structure, where a large state estimation MSE (high transmission urgency) and good wireless channel conditions (good transmission opportunities) promote the active mode of the sensors. Using the Lyapunov techniques, we provide the closed-form sufficient condition for stability and closed-form characterizations on the trade-off between the state estimation MSE and average power consumption of the sensors. We also propose a design guideline for the constant filter gain via minimizing the state estimation MSE. The proposed scheme is also compared with various representative literature and we show that significant performance gains can be achieved."

In our proposed scheme, the BS does not discard the collided packets and attempts to recover them through inter-frame SIC operations. We evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme in terms of resource efficiency. Results show that a certain level of system load is required to maximize the efficiency of our proposed scheme, which can be achieved through a probabilistic retransmission (PR) policy. Consequently, our proposed scheme can effectively improve the resource efficiency and can be suitable to accommodate more IoT devices with a smaller amount of resources, compared to the conventional one."

Traditional cryptographic key-based solutions are not suitable for severe resources-constrained networks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose a lightweight intrusion detection mechanism by exploring physical layer attributes that are unique and difficult to impersonate. Specifically, a long-short memory network (LSTM) is employed as an intelligent classifier to distinguish different transmitters based on channel state information (CSI) features. Then we develop a comprehensive 5G NR channel detection model based on LSTM under dynamic channel conditions to identify malicious attacks by intelligently analyzing CSI. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution improves detection accuracy and successfully prevent systems from spoofing attacks."

GF access in the uplink typically uses a preamble followed by data transmissions. Building GF systems ensuring a high success probability for user access while utilizing a limited number of preambles is a challenge. In this work, a preamble-based GF IoT system is considered, where the total number of users in the system correspond to two categories - (i) fixed and (ii) random (modelled using a Poisson distribution). Analytical expressions are derived for the number of preambles required for GF access in each of the categories, such that the user transmissions are successful with high probability. It is shown that the analytical results match with the simulation results. Furthermore, an approach to choose the number of preambles based on the probability of success of at least all but two users is proposed, which results in a significant reduction in the number of preambles."

Traditionally, each vertical industry utilizes dedicated communications networks. In contrast, the 5th Generation of Mobile Communication Networks (5G) aims to fulfill Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for various vertical industries. This is achieved by deploying several, virtually dedicated networks, known as slices, on top of a unified, physical communication infrastructure. While various solutions have been presented for Core Network Slicing, the here presented approach aims to provide an end-to-end solution by allocating Radio Access Network (RAN) resources, realizing slicing for mission-critical applications via a novel scheduler design. A proof of concept is provided by way of detailed empirical evaluations, based on IoT scenarios from the energy sector (i.e., Smart Grids). The proposed RAN Network Slicing solution is shown to reliably sustain service guarantees of critical applications, while coexisting with non-critical services. Application-dependent, dynamic, inter-slice resource sharing enables an efficient use of available RAN spectrum.

8708915,Virtual Network Embedding in Fiber-Wireless Access Networks for Resource-Efficient IoT Service Provisioning,"The rise of Industry 4.0 is pushing more machine devices into the connection of the communication network. Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as an enabling technique to support automatic information transmission and the universal interconnection among massive machine devices. Unlike the human type communication (HTC) in the conventional Internet, IoT features machine type communication (HTC) with small data granularity and massive connections, which impose new challenges on the network resource allocation earlier designed for HTC communication. One of the challenging issues is how we can manage the network resource for the IoT service provisioning. As a promising network architecture for the “last-mile” access in 5G communication, Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access network compromises the high bandwidth capacity of the optical access network and the flexibility of wireless access network. Especially, network virtualization as an emerging technique provides FiWi with the feasibility for the coordinated bandwidth allocation of wireless access network and optical access network. The evolution of FiWi access network should be not only oriented to the technological breakthrough in regular traffic, but also be supportive of the emerging IoT traffic. In this paper, we focus on the resource allocation problem in FiWi access network supporting IoT service. We first analyze the dynamics of regular traffic and propose the traffic prediction method based on Q-Learning. Then, we propose a virtual network embedding algorithm to map exactly the virtual networks of IoT traffic to the idle resource of the virtual networks of regular traffic without degrading the performance of regular traffic. Thus, the proposed algorithm can improve the resource utilization more effectively. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a higher acceptance ratio and lower migration ratio of IoT traffic."
9209751,Computer Vision-Assisted Instant Alerts in 5G,"This paper introduces an innovative model which incorporates vehicle On-Board Unit (OBU) data and roadside video information to provide instant alert messages to drivers. We apply computer vision techniques to perform real-time danger event detection and to identify specific surrounding vehicles that should be alerted. Different from traditional broadcast-based alerting, we propose to send these instant alert messages to the target vehicles by unicast and geocast. To do so, an accurate method is required to analyze the spatial relation of vehicles. Also, to confine our alert messages to only those target vehicles, we rely on roadside cameras and apply a sensor fusion technique that can link a video object with its communication MAC address. Through this innovative idea, we integrate computer vision with 5G networks and enable transmitting instant alerts to precise vehicles without interfering irrelevant vehicles. How to incorporate our system with 3GPP V2X by setting proper transmission parameters is also addressed. To validate our idea, we present four common road danger events and show how our model works.

8738773,Overview of Radio Propagation Models for 5G and beyond,"The demand for mobile connectivity is continuously increasing, and by 2020, mobile and wireless communications will serve not only very dense populations of mobile phones and nomadic computers, but also the expected multiplicity of devices and sensors located in machines, vehicles, health systems and city infrastructures. The fifth (and beyond) generation of radio communication networks (5G, 5G+) are expected to implement technologies for supporting wireless connectivity for any rates, type of communicating units, and scenario. Whereas spectral and spatial efficiency are key challenges, in addition to constraints such as energy consumption, latency, mobility, adaptability, heterogeneity, coverage and reliability, the multi-dimensional radio channel remains central in such contexts. Multiple antenna systems (MIMO), interference recognition and management as well as cooperation among separate network nodes are inherently multi-dimensional techniques and should always be designed with a proper knowledge not only of the channel, but also of the interference. In addition, the use of higher frequency ranges (cm-and mm-waves) is investigated to address the spectrum shortage.

9064145,Joint User Association and VNF Placement for Latency Sensitive Applications in 5G Networks,"With the advent of 5G systems, telecommunication service providers (TSPs) have been facing a tremendous transition by the raised expectations of supporting billions of IoT devices and an unprecedented amount of generated data. This revolutionary transformation necessitates innovative approaches such as multi-access edge computing (MEC) to meet the requirements of many novel applications in terms of their high data rate and low latency. The idea behind MEC is to move data, virtualization, and processing capabilities from central data centers to the edge of the network. However, resources at the network edge are very scarce and costly to provision. Therefore, TSPs have to make smart decisions on how to utilize the network resources such as to make sure that the user service requirements (e.g., data rate, latency) are satisfied while the network resources are used most efficiently. In this paper, we study the problem of joint user association, VNF placement, and resource allocation, employing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) technique. The objectives of the formulations are to minimize (i) the service provisioning cost, (ii) the number of VNF instances, and (iii) the transport network utilization, having an overarching goal of drawing a comparison between these different approaches."

In this paper, we've tried to challenge IoT5G systems in smart cities from both cultural and technological viewpoints. Although we should not be pessimist about critical situations we're encountering in realization of smart cities, But we must be realist about serious dangers and high price of invasion of privacy in IoT systems. They could probably play major roles as command centers for organized international systematic crimes which will threaten human citizens.

While the ultra-dense deployment is required for 5G edge services, in the upcoming era of 6G with an even more limited communication range, it is almost impossible to achieve 6G service coverage with dense deployments. To address this fundamental limit, we propose EdgeGO, a mobile resource-sharing framework that employs mobile edge servers to provide a cost-effective deployment of 6G edge computing, which enables edge resource sharing for massive IoT devices. Unlike traditional mobile cloudlets, EdgeGO exploits the asynchronization between requests receiving and results returning to decouple the stringent delay and resource requirements for edge computing. As a result, the server moving and task processing could be paralleled. Besides, EdgeGO incorporates a two-layer iterative updating algorithm, which jointly optimizes path planning and task scheduling to improve the overall task efficiency. Extensive simulation results show that, by careful managing mobility and task execution of the edge servers, EdgeGO is able to drastically increase the resource utilization by 166.67% and decrease the deployment cost of 6G edge computing by 25.58%."

The operating frequency band of 5G mobile communication is 28 to 77 GHz in the mmWave band.

8863420,Latency and Reliability-Aware Workload Assignment in IoT Networks With Mobile Edge Clouds,"Along with the dramatic increase in the number of IoT devices, different IoT services with heterogeneous QoS requirements are evolving with the aim of making the current society smarter and more connected. In order to deliver such services to the end users, the network infrastructure has to accommodate the tremendous workload generated by the smart devices and their heterogeneous and stringent latency and reliability requirements. This would only be possible with the emergence of ultra reliable low latency communications (uRLLC) promised by 5G. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged as an enabling technology to help with the realization of such services by bringing the remote computing and storage capabilities of the cloud closer to the users. However, integrating uRLLC with MEC would require the network operator to efficiently map the generated workloads to MEC nodes along with resolving the trade-off between the latency and reliability requirements. Thus, we study in this paper the problem of Workload Assignment (WA) and formulate it as a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) to decide on the assignment of the workloads to the available MEC nodes. Due to the complexity of the WA problem, we decompose the problem into two subproblems; Reliability Aware Candidate Selection (RACS) and Latency Aware Workload Assignment (LAWA-MIP). We evaluate the performance of the decomposition approach and propose a more scalable approach; Tabu meta-heuristic (WA-Tabu). Through extensive numerical evaluation, we analyze the performance and show the efficiency of our proposed approach under different system parameters."

The PMC and ACC are deployed on the same data channel to implement the management of access control policies and the authorization of access. The CEC deployed on another channel is used to add behavior records collected from IIoT devices and calculate the credit value of IIoT domain. Specifically, we design a two-step credit-based Raft consensus mechanism, which can select the orderer nodes dynamically to achieve fast and reliable consensus based on historical behavior records stored in the ledger. Furthermore, we implement the proposed framework on a real-world testbed and compare it with the framework based on practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus. The experiment results show that our proposed framework can maintain lower consensus cost time with 100 ms level and achieves four to five times throughput with lower hardware resource consumption and communication consumption. Besides, our design also improves the security and robustness of the access control process."

8919974,Energy Management Framework for 5G Ultra-Dense Networks Using Graph Theory,"The next-generation 5G networks are being developed with high promised capabilities. Beyond just multitudes faster data speed, 5G is expected to serve billions of connected devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), with the right trade-offs between speed, latency, and energy at an affordable cost. 5G radio networks will strongly depend on using ultra-dense integrated Small Cells (SCs) beside the Macro Cells (MCs). This kind of Ultra-Dense Networks (UDN) consisting of a large number of MCs and SCs will significantly increase network energy demands. A practical method to control energy consumption is by dynamically controlling power-saving modes in radio networks. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative energy management framework for 5G UDN using graph theory. The 5G network is first modeled as a graph, then graph theory methods are exploited to determine the order of nodes at which power-off/on procedure is applied. We also show that significant power savings are achievable by considering only a subset of network nodes and thus reduce traffic migration and control plane signaling. We evaluated the proposed algorithm at different network densification levels and several load factors including two real-life networks. We also present the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the robustness of networks optimized using it. We also show that power savings up to 25% at full load and 65% during off-peak can be achieved using the proposed algorithm. These power savings increase further if no constraints are imposed on traffic migration and control signaling."
8629874,NOMA-Based Resource Allocation and Mobility Enhancement Framework for IoT in Next Generation Cellular Networks,"With the unprecedented technological advances witnessed in the last two decades, more devices are connected to the Internet, forming what is called the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT devices with heterogeneous characteristics and the quality of experience (QoE) requirements may engage in the dynamic spectrum market due to the scarcity of radio resources. We propose a framework to efficiently quantify and supply radio resources to the IoT devices by developing intelligent systems. The primary goal of this paper is to study the characteristics of the next generation of cellular networks with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enable connectivity to clustered IoT devices. First, we demonstrate how the distribution and QoE requirements of IoT devices impact the required number of radio resources in real time. Second, we prove that using an extended auction algorithm by implementing a series of complementary functions enhance the radio resource utilization efficiency. The results show a substantial reduction in the number of sub-carriers required when compared with conventional OMA and the intelligent clustering is scalable and adaptable to the cellular environment. Ability to move spectrum usages from one cluster to other clusters after borrowing when a cluster has fewer users or move out of the boundary is another soft feature that contributes to the reported radio resource utilization efficiency. Moreover, the proposed framework provides IoT service providers cost estimation to control their spectrum acquisition to achieve the required quality of service with a guaranteed bit rate (GBR) and non-GBR."

IoT brings a large amount of data transported on the network. Considering those data, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be naturally utilized to make network efficiently and reliably. However, how to fully apply ML to IoT driven wireless network is still open. The fundamental reason is that wireless communication pursuits the high capacity and quality facing the challenges from the varying and fading wireless channel. So in this paper, we explore feasible combination for ML and IoT driven wireless network from wireless channel perspective. Firstly, a three-level structure of wireless channel fading features is defined in order to classify the versatile propagation environments. This three-layer structure includes scenario, meter and wavelength levels. Based on this structure, there are different tasks like service prediction and pushing, self-organization networking, self adapting largescale fading modeling and so on, which can be abstracted into problems like regression, classification, clustering, etc. Then, we introduce corresponding ML methods to different levels from channel perspective, which makes their interdisciplinary research promisingly."

This methodology ease the design process, starting from the modes of a squared ground plane with length a, and then analyzing how they change when the plane is reshaped into a (a-2b) x (a-2b) x b cavity. Characteristic modes analysis gives a visual insight establishing some constrains for setting the optimum height (b) of the cavity and the optimum feeding configuration of the ports.

Future IoT 5G-mMTC applications for environmental monitoring, remote metering, and surveillance over metropolitan areas are among the main enablers of the Smart City concept. The role of satellite to transfer large amount of data gathered from (any type of) sensors spread over geographical metropolitan areas in a country can be helpful to promote the implementation of smart applications aimed for example to optimize usage of resources (e.g., energy), transportation flows, centralized control of critical infrastructures, etc., at a nation-wide scale. One of the main limitations of this scenario consists in the availability of sensors devices incorporating transmission facilities to directly connect to the satellite. In this paper, we assess the achievable performance of a FttC-based capillary network extended to include terrestrial radio stations (RSs) collecting data from surrounding IoT devices. RS data are then transferred using one (or more) copper pair(s) to the satellite modem installed at the cabinet as well as at the central office. Performance of the considered network architecture is expressed in terms of the blocking probability for satellite access."

The 3GPP standards which in full is 3 rd Generation Partnership Project have given 5G the name New Radio (NR) in which it reuses the spectrum allocated for both (NB-IoT) Narrowband Internet of Things and 4G. There are different elements which contribute to an interference named Narrowband Interference (NBI) which is caused by spectrum reuse of NR, NB-IoT and (LTE) Long Term Evolution, thus leads to mismatch of sampling rate and performance degradation. This paper presents a survey of these interference challenges. The main contribution of this paper is to comprehensively analyse different classifications to possibly assist the form of coexistence of 5GNR NB-IoT and LTE. Different approaches were analysed, their strength and limitations in various literatures, however the interference mitigation scheme is still an open gap determined."
8428640,Soft Decision Control Iterative Channel Estimation for the Internet of Things in 5G Networks,"In the fifth generation mobile networks, generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) is expected as the candidate waveform which can flexibly meet the requirements of diverse applications and scenarios for the Internet of Things (IoT) because of its advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In order to achieve the reliable data transmission in GFDM-based IoT systems, channel estimation (CE) is a prerequisite. However, the 2-D block modulation and the nonorthogonality between subcarriers for GFDM make it almost impossible that the conventional CE methods suitable for OFDM are directly applied to GFDM. To cope with this problem, a soft decision control strategy-based iterative CE (SDC-ICE) method is proposed in this paper. First, the received signal is equalized by the channel frequency response (CFR) from the pilot-based CE. After GFDM demodulation and Turbo decoding, the feedback log-likelihood ratio is utilized to rebuild symbols for data-aided CE by a redesigned Turbo receiver. Subsequently, the feedback information of both current and former iterations is used to improve the reliability of rebuilt symbols. The CFR obtained from SDC-ICE is used for equalization in the next iteration. The performance of SDC-ICE can be improved by increasing the iterations. Finally, the bit error rate (BER) and mean square error (MSE) performances of SDC-ICE and hard decision control strategy-based iterative CE (HDC-ICE) are simulated and evaluated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has better BER and MSE performance than HDC-ICE within fewer iterations."

The impact of delay constraints may lead to rejection of demands, resulting in low resource utilization of network resources. This is especially severe when dynamic traffic is considered. Therefore, intelligent resource allocation algorithms are required to use the network resources in delay constrained scenario efficiently. Moreover, these algorithms should guarantee quality of service (QoS) between different priority slices during congestion case. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of delay constraint on the performance of an online resource allocation algorithm based on an intelligent efficient squatting and kicking model (SKM), proved in other works to be the most effective up to the present time yet. SKM incorporates kicking and squatting of resources as innovative techniques enabling it to achieve 100% resource utilization and acceptance ratio for higher priority slices in scenarios where the other state of art algorithms not able to reach by far in some scenarios. Simulation results showed that incorporating delay constraints has a significant impact on the performance, resulting in up to 10% and 4% reduction in terms of average resource utilization and acceptance ratios respectively."

8761658,A Mobility Management Architecture for Seamless Delivery of 5G-IoT Services,"Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Network Slicing techniques have a potential to augment 5G-IoT network services. Telecommunication operators use a diverse set of radio access technologies to provide services for users. Mobility management is one such service that needs attention for new 5G deployments. The QoS requirements in 5G networks are user specific. Network slicing along with MEC has been promoted as a key enabler for such on-demand service schemes. This paper focuses on radio resource access across heterogeneous networks for mobile roaming users. A unified service architecture is proposed enabling seamless handover between a 5G (New Generation Core) service and a 4G (Evolved Packet Core) service via the network slicing paradigm. An identifier-locator (I-L) concept that allows active source-IP sessions is used to handle the seamless hand-over. Signaling costs, service disruptions and other resource reservation requirements are considered in the evaluation to assure that profit for mobile edge operators is achieved. Simulation experiments are considered to provide performance comparisons against the state-of-the-art Distributed Mobility Management Protocol (DMM)."
9417315,Method to Minimize Radio Resource Wastage and Battery Consumption in NB-IoT,"The interplay between two key design aspects of Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) leads to a problematic scenario. First aspect is the excessive repetition of channels to achieve extended coverage, while second aspect is the absence of physical layer Scheduling Request (SR) mechanism which alternatively is done through Connected Mode Random Access Procedure (CRP). This problematic scenario remained unidentified so far and occurs frequently in real field deployments leading to significant wastage of radio resources. The underlying cause behind this issue can be attributed to a shortcoming in the present-day NB-IoT radio resource scheduler (residing in eNB). NB-IoT scheduler, in the process of drawing basic concepts from its Long-Term Evolution (LTE) counterpart has overlooked the complication arising out of the above unique design aspects of NB-IoT. In this paper we propose a novel method that can completely prevent this problematic scenario. This method introduces a new scheduling concept - “CRP Initiation State Aware” scheduling, which is exemplary in the sense that it can be realized with extremely simple implementation at eNB, that is neither complex nor memory intensive. The benefit of this method in terms of radio resource savings is substantial in today's Machine Type Communication (MTC) context and is expected to increase manifold as we move towards 5G Massive MTC (mMTC) requirements. We further propose an enhancement to the “CRP Initiation State aware” scheduling that considerably enhances the UE' battery life along-with more savings in radio resources."
8761334,Resource Allocation for URLLC in 5G Mission-Critical IoT Networks,"Ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is one of three pillar applications that should be supported by the fifth generation (5G) communications. The research on this topic is still in its infancy due to the difficulties in guaranteeing extremely high reliability (say 10 -9 ) and low latency (say 1 ms) simultaneously. The achievable data rate under the short packet transmission is a complicated function of the transmission power, the blocklength and the decoding error probability. In this paper, we consider resource allocation problem in a factory automation scenario, where the central controller aims for transniitting different packets to two devices (e.g., a robot and an actuator). Two transmission schemes are considered: orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and relay-assisted transmission. We aim to jointly optimize the blocklength and power allocation to minimize the error probability of the actuator subject to reliability requirement of the robot as well as the latency constraints. We develop low-complexity algorithms to address the optimization problems for each transmission scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the relay-assisted transmission significantly outperforms the OMA scheme."
9565335,Massive Uncoordinated Multiple Access for Beyond 5G,"Existing wireless communication systems have been mainly designed to provide substantial gain in terms of data rates. However, 5G and Beyond will depart from this scheme, with the objective not only to provide services with higher data rates. One of the main goals is to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Supporting massive uplink communications for devices with sporadic traffic pattern and short-packet size, as it is in many mMTC use cases, is a challenging task, particularly when the control signaling is not negligible in size compared to the payload. In addition, channel estimation becomes challenging for sporadic and short-packet transmission due to the limited number of employed pilots. In this paper, a new uplink multiple access (MA) scheme is proposed for mMTC, which can support a large number of uncoordinated IoT devices with short-packet and sporadic traffic. The proposed uplink MA scheme removes the overheads associated with the device identifier as well as pilots and preambles related to channel estimation. An alternative mechanism for device identification (DI) is employed, where a unique spreading code is dedicated to each IoT device as identifier. This unique code is simultaneously used for the spreading purpose and DI. Two IoT DI algorithms which employ sparse signal reconstruction methods are proposed to determine the active IoT devices prior to data detection. Specifically, the Bayesian information criterion model order selection method is employed to develop an IoT DI algorithm for unknown and time-varying activity rate. Our proposed MA scheme benefits from a new non-coherent nonlinear multiuser detection algorithm designed on the basis of unsupervised machine learning techniques to enable data detection without a priori knowledge on channel state information. For performance improvement, an extension to multiple receive antennas through hard decision combining is proposed. The effectiven...

Recognizing the capability of satellite systems to offer wide coverage and enable cross-countries deployment, 3GPP is considering 5G technologies to support Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN). However, while studies have shown the capability of NB-IoT to meet the 5G latency and capacity expectations in terrestrial networks, the question remains open for the satellite context. In this paper, we consider the necessary mechanisms for adapting NB-IoT to the satellite context and provide a study of the delay of a communication as function of gNodeB parameters, cell specification (size, link budget, satellite altitude) and payload size. Our study adopts the configurations used for the simulation based on the link budget given in the 3GPP Study Item and considers not only the random access procedure but also the whole communication process, with signalling, uplink /downlink messages and connection release. We find that the optimal Block Error Rate for minimizing the delay of the communication and optimizing the spectral efficiency is lower that the one recommended in nominal 5G specification."
8885002,The Importance of Being Thing Or the Trivial Role of Powering Serious IoT Scenarios,"In this article, we call for a ""Walk Before You Run"" adjustment in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) research and development exercise. Without first settling the quest for what thing is or could be or do, we run the risk of presumptuous visions, or hypes, that can only fail the realities and limits of what is actually possible, leading to customers and consumers confusion as well as market hesitations. Specifically, without a carefully-designed Thing architecture in place, it will be very difficult to find the ""magic"" we are so addicted and accustomed to - programming! Programming the IoT, as we once programmed the mainframe, the workstation, the PC and the mobile devices, is the natural way to realize a fancy IoT scenario or an application. Without Thing architectures and their enablement of new programming models for IoT - we will continue to only envision fancy scenarios but unable to unleash the IoT full potential. This article raises these concerns and provides a view into the future by first looking back into our short history of pervasive computing. The article focuses on the domain of ""Personal"" IoT and will address key new requirements for such Thing architecture. Also, practicing what we preach, we present our ongoing efforts on the Atlas Thing Architecture showing how it supports a variety of thing notions, and how it enables novel models for programmability."

Cloud and Edge Computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of things (IoT) pave the path for the most important role of 5G: to attain an integration platform for the challenges of vertical applications. In this work, we first review these enabling features of 5G for autonomous driving and their integration in our autonomous driving testbed on urban public roads. We then propose an enhancement to the 5G vehicle to everything (V2X) architecture by incorporating the informationcentric communication paradigm. Our simulations of a proposed approach for integrated service discovery and placement in the high mobility settings of autonomous driving applications show improved service continuity and latency measured by hop counts to service endpoints and number of cache nodes.

8014424,Interference Cooperation via Distributed Game in 5G Networks,"Nash noncooperative power game is an effective method to implement interference cooperation in downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO). Power equilibrium point of Nash noncooperative power game can achieve a satisfactory tradeoff between self-benefits of Internet of Things (IoT) users and interference between IoT users which largely enhance the edge IoT user throughput. However, either power strategy space, i.e., the enabled range of power allocation for IoT users, or overall BS transmit power in the existing Nash noncooperative power games is generally static. This limits the performance of systems, especially in IoT systems, etc., in 5G. As an effort to address these problems, we design a novel framework of Nash noncooperative game with iterative convergence for downlink MU-MIMO. We first decompose the MU-MIMO into multiple virtual single-antenna transmit-receive pairs with a stream analytical model. Afterwards, based on streams, we propose a noncooperative water-filling power game with pricing (WFPGP) where the power strategy space of each stream can be dynamically determined by iterative water-filling . We derive the sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of WFPGP game, in which the verification of the sufficient condition can be executed in a distributed manner. By simulations, we verify the performance of WFPGP compared to other Nash noncooperative games."

These are wired and wireless sensing systems that send information from one device to another. The network traffic prediction problem includes the prediction of future network traffic characteristics from observations of past traffic. Network traffic forecasting has many applications including network monitoring, resource management, and fault detection. Machine learning (ML) has been successfully applied to traffic prediction. ML technologies have proven capable of capturing nonlinear patterns in data, making them a good candidate for traffic prediction. In this paper, we perform the delay prediction in IoT communication using a multistep ahead prediction (MSP) and single-step ahead prediction (SSP) with Time Series NARX Recurrent Neural Networks.

9079930,Energy-Efficient Spectrum Sensing for IoT Devices,"Device-to-device communications have been considered as an indispensable enabler, which reduces the traffic burden associated with fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. To improve the radio spectrum utilization under such a communications scheme, cognitive spectrum sensing can be used to identify temporarily available spectrum chunks for direct interconnections among user devices. Although various sensing techniques have been proposed during the last decade, improving the sensing efficiency (SE), such as energy reduction and positive sensing ratio, remains an open challenge. The problem becomes more pronounced in 5G networks, wherein battery-constrained Internet-of-Things devices (IoTDs) are densely interconnected. In this article, we optimize the SE by leveraging a lightweight yet effective adaptive medium learning method with a probabilistic decay feature. Specifically, the wireless channels that are likely available for IoTDs are sorted and sensed in the descending order of their availability likelihood/probabilities, which indicate the estimated percentage of the availability of the sensed channels. These probabilities learn from the preceding sensing results, and they decay with time. Numerical results show that the proposed sensing approach achieves significant SE improvement compared to state-of-the-art algorithms."
9739352,Efficient Privacy Protection Protocols for 5G Enabled Positioning in Industrial IoT,"High-accuracy positioning has drawn huge attention with the potential in enhancing location-aware communications, intelligent transportation, and so on. The emergency of the fifth-generation (5G) technologies like device to device (D2D) communications, vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications and crowdsourcing networks is expected to help achieve highly accurate positioning. By employing nearby mobile terminals to estimate position cooperatively, these technologies can improve positioning accuracy effectively, especially in indoor and urban areas. Despite the benefit, the potential information disclosure in these positioning systems threatens the engagement of public participants (also known as reference points). The location of the reference points and their distances to a target point is quite sensitive since they can be easily used to locate the reference points once exposed. Though existing solutions based on Paillier homomorphic encryption have been proposed to preserve the privacy of distance information. The sensitivity of reference points’ locations is ignored. Additionally, the adoption of Paillier introduces a high computation cost, which is impractical in reality. To address the above problems, this paper proposes two efficient protocols, named Pub-pos and Pri-pos. By leveraging matrix concatenation and multiplication, these two protocols can disguise the original sensitive data, including both distance and location information, into a random matrix while keeping a positioning result intact. We analyze security strength, complexity and optimal variable selection of the proposed protocols. Numerous experiments verify that our proposed protocols have significant efficiency improvement in both system and individual levels compared with a Paillier based solution."

Thereby, 5G will provide important steps towards unlocking the full potential of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we propose a lightweight IoT platform for continuous vital sign analysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) is acquired via textile sensors and continuously sent from a smartphone to an edge device using cellular networks. The edge device applies a state-of-the art deep learning model for providing a binary end-to-end classification if a myocardial infarction is at hand. Using this infrastructure, experiments with four volunteers were conducted. We compare 3rd, 4th-, and 5th-generation cellular networks (release 15) with respect to transmission latency, data corruption, and duration of machine learning inference. The best performance is achieved using 5G showing an average transmission latency of 110ms and data corruption in 0.07% of ECG samples. Deep learning inference took approximately 170ms. In conclusion, 5G cellular networks in combination with edge devices are a suitable infrastructure for continuous vital sign analysis using deep learning models. Future 5G releases will introduce multi-access edge computing (MEC) as a paradigm for bringing edge devices nearer to mobile clients. This will decrease transmission latency and eventually enable automatic emergency alerting in near real-time."

It is due to the fact that with an increase in the enormous amount of the number of users and devices, there has been an increase in the demands of service availability within a fraction of seconds by the end users. It results in an increase in burden on the existing network infrastructure with respect to Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) provisions to the end users and service providers. However, caching the most popular content on the user equipments (UE's) can resolve the aforementioned problems. Motivated from these facts, in this article, we propose a model to address the problem of the cache localization decision making. In the proposed scheme, first, we collected the data set traces to predict the cache locations. Then, we predicted the locations where the user can cache the most accessed content using machine learning classification models. The classification models used in the proposed solution are decision tree and random forest. The metrics used for evaluation of the results obtained are access delay and energy consumption of the UEs. On comparing the proposal with the other existing state-of-the-art models, we observed that the random forest model yields higher accuracy as compared to other existing models. Also, we have observed that the access delay is maximum at the user's end when contents are shared with the gateway."

9540762,Blockchain-based Cross-domain Authentication for Intelligent 5G-enabled Internet of Drones,"While 5G can facilitate high-speed Internet access and make over-the-horizon control a reality for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones), there are also potential security and privacy considerations, for example, authentication among drones. Centralized authentication approaches not only suffer from a single point of failure, but they are also incapable of cross-domain authentication, which complicates the cooperation of drones from different domains. To address these limitations, a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme for intelligent 5G-enabled Internet of drones is proposed in this paper. Our approach employs multiple signatures based on threshold sharing to build an identity federation for collaborative domains. This allows us to support domain joining and exiting. Reliable communication between cross-domain devices is achieved by utilizing smart contract for authentication. The session keys are negotiated to secure subsequent communication between two parties. Our security and performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme is resistant to common attacks targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices (including drones), as well as demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency."
9656675,Data-Driven Random Access Optimization in Multi-Cell IoT Networks with NOMA,"Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a key technology to enable massive machine type communications (mMTC) in 5G networks and beyond. In this paper, NOMA is applied to improve the random access efficiency in high-density spatially-distributed multi-cell wireless IoT networks, where IoT devices contend for accessing the shared wireless channel using an adaptive p-persistent slotted Aloha protocol. To enable a capacity-optimal network, a novel formulation of random channel access management is proposed, in which the transmission probability of each IoT device is tuned to maximize the geometric mean of users’ expected capacity. It is shown that the network optimization objective is high dimensional and mathematically intractable, yet it admits favourable mathematical properties that enable the design of efficient data-driven algorithmic solutions which do not require a priori knowledge of the channel model or network topology. A centralized model-based algorithm and a scalable distributed model-free algorithm, are proposed to optimally tune the transmission probabilities of IoT devices and attain the maximum capacity. The convergence of the proposed algorithms to the optimal solution is further established based on convex optimization and game-theoretic analysis. Extensive simulations demonstrate the merits of the novel formulation and the efficacy of the proposed algorithms."
8736974,SAHCI: Scheduling Approach for Heterogeneous Content-Centric IoT Applications,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the dominating paradigms of the new era with its abilities to provide ubiquitous intelligence and pervasive interconnections to diverse physical objects. With the advancements, such as new generation 5G communication and cloud/edge computing-based paradigms, the degree of domination is expected to further increase. Therefore, improvements for quality of service have become a critical issue. Traditional packets scheduling algorithms cannot meet the requirements of the large-scale IoT systems. In this paper, a novel scheduling approach is proposed for different data classes (types) to be exchanged between heterogeneous nodes of a generic IoT infrastructure. The possible ways of organizing these classes depending on different metrics, such as time latency, reliability, and data loss, are investigated. The proposed approach has the advantage of being able to tune the priorities and network characteristics to reach a specifically desired performance state. Since each type of packets is considered separately, it is possible to prioritize them, by tuning the related parameters, which changes the priorities between packets. The numerical results presented show that the new approach performs better than the existing typical scheduling approaches. The developed approach can be used in the various IoT applications with the support of 5G communication and edge computing, such as agriculture, wearables, connected cars, smart retail, and smart cities."

With the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) by 5G networks, the number of radio devices by each user will drop from 2 to around 7 to 10 devices. Despite this, the saturation of the system does not arise, thanks to the connected equipment's high density, offered by Massive machine type communications (mMTC). A Radio Resource Management RRM procedure for efficient distribution of available radio resources between those devices is essential for 5G systems. In this article, we have studied the behavior of scheduling algorithms in a 5G environment, for a large number of connected objects and for different types of data flows, while limiting to small cells (Femtocells) with a speed of 3 km/h of the User Equipment (UE). In this objective, we program in C++ two new scheduling algorithms at the base station gNb, namely Exponential PF (EXP/PF) and Exponential Rule (EXP-rule), in addition to those already existing (Maximum-Weight (MW) and Proportional Fair (PF)), using the mmWave model of the famous NS-3 simulator. The performance comparison of the different 5G scheduler schemes was inspected via two important parameters, which are the user throughput and the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR). Consequently, we have demonstrated that the scheduling algorithms used by LTE networks can be implemented at the 5G gNB level. The results of our simulations have shown that the EXP-rule algorithm provides the best SINR and DataRate values for voice, video and data streams."

In this paper, the CRNs do cross-layer (X-layer) optimization by finding the parameters from the physical layer (Layer-1) of the OSI model and the network layer (Layer-3) of the OSI model so as to progress the end-to-end secure transmission of cognition for 5G and IoT traffic. The proposed model follows the invention target by applying a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to select after that hop for sending based on the waiting duration found on every router when keeping SINR lower than threshold determines by primary channel. A fully linked feed-forward Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is applied by secondary users (SUs) to estimate the activity value function. The activity value contains SINR to the primary user (PU) at the layer-1 and following hop to the routers for every packet at the layer-3. The advantage to the neural network (NN) is Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for secure encrypted high-resolution video traffic over 5G network which depends upon the packet drop rate and the bit error rate applied for transmission. As evaluated to the execution of DQN learning at the physical layer, this system gives for 37% gain in the video quality for routers with short queues and besides reaches a balanced load upon a network with routers with different service rates."

Conventional cloud and edge computing paradigms may thus become insufficient in supporting the increasingly stringent operating requirements of intelligent IoT devices that can move unpredictably and at high speeds. Complementing these, the concept of fog emerges to deploy cooperative cloud-like functions in the immediate vicinity of various moving devices, such as connected and autonomous vehicles, on the road and in the air. Envisioning the gradual evolution of these infrastructures toward an increasingly denser geographical distribution of fog functionality, we in this work put forward the vision of dense moving fog for intelligent IoT applications. To this aim, we review the recent powerful enablers, outline the main challenges and opportunities, and corroborate the performance benefits of collaborative dense fog operation in a characteristic use case featuring a connected fleet of autonomous vehicles."

The performances of the proposed design are then compared with other referred power amplifier circuits. It can be noticed that this proposed design exhibits outstanding performance incase of PAE and power gain. Three-stage PA is proposed targeting the 802.11n WLAN protocol that operates in the 2.8 GHz frequency band with strict linearity specifications."
9113305,"A Survey of Multi-Access Edge Computing in 5G and Beyond: Fundamentals, Technology Integration, and State-of-the-Art","Driven by the emergence of new compute-intensive applications and the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is foreseen that the emerging 5G network will face an unprecedented increase in traffic volume and computation demands. However, end users mostly have limited storage capacities and finite processing capabilities, thus how to run compute-intensive applications on resource-constrained users has recently become a natural concern. Mobile edge computing (MEC), a key technology in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network, can optimize mobile resources by hosting compute-intensive applications, process large data before sending to the cloud, provide the cloud-computing capabilities within the radio access network (RAN) in close proximity to mobile users, and offer context-aware services with the help of RAN information. Therefore, MEC enables a wide variety of applications, where the real-time response is strictly required, e.g., driverless vehicles, augmented reality, robotics, and immerse media. Indeed, the paradigm shift from 4G to 5G could become a reality with the advent of new technological concepts. The successful realization of MEC in the 5G network is still in its infancy and demands for constant efforts from both academic and industry communities. In this survey, we first provide a holistic overview of MEC technology and its potential use cases and applications. Then, we outline up-to-date researches on the integration of MEC with the new technologies that will be deployed in 5G and beyond. We also summarize testbeds and experimental evaluations, and open source activities, for edge computing. We further summarize lessons learned from state-of-the-art research works as well as discuss challenges and potential future directions for MEC research."

9647759,of Kalman Filtering for Clock Synchronization in PTP-Unaware Networks,"In fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications and beyond, clock synchronization is essential for base stations to perform time-coordinated transmissions. In particular, the IEEE 1588 precision time protocol (PTP) is the industry standard for precise time synchronization over a packet-based network. In this context, clock synchronization algorithms play a fundamental role to achieve more accurate and robust estimates by improving stability against packet delay variation (PDV), environmental phenomena and other sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we use datasets collected by a testbed composed of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to evaluate the performance of the Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm for clock synchronization in a realistic environment. More specifically, the evaluation is performed using a legacy Ethernet network with differents network loads and two different oscillators."
9216581,"Ultra-Low-Latency, High-Fidelity Analog-to-Digital-Compression Radio-Over-Fiber (ADX-RoF) for MIMO Fronthaul in 5G and Beyond","Wired-wireless convergence technology such as radio-over-fiber (RoF) is regarded as a promising candidate to deliver broadband wireless data from/to edge cloud to/from antenna sites, a notable example being the fronthaul (FH) in centralized/cloud radio access network (C-RAN). In 5G and beyond, the latency, bandwidth and fidelity requirements on FH pose great challenges to the RoF schemes. In this article, we focus on analog-to-digital-compression RoF (ADX-RoF) scheme based on low-latency MIMO data compression, which has the potential to reduce FH data rate by ~90% compared with traditional digital RoF (CPRI) while still maintaining signal fidelity for high-order radio modulation. To verify the practicality of ADX-RoF in the latency-sensitive FH scenario, real-time hardware demonstration with latency evaluation is indispensable. We propose and design a real-time ADX, which achieves low-latency and high-throughput together with high-fidelity. Enabled by the ADX prototyped on a single-chip field-programmable radio platform (i.e., Xilinx RFSoC), we experimentally demonstrate 16-channel MIMO radio reception, real-time ADX processing and RoF transport. With <; 500 ns one-way ADX latency, less than 1.5% average EVM is achieved for 1024QAM, 61.44 MHz NR-class signals at a compression ratio of 13.3%. Negligible fiber-induced performance penalty is observed after 40 km transport. The results highlight the attractiveness of ADX-RoF for future FH."
9355538,Joint Traffic Offloading and Aging Control in 5G IoT Networks,"The widespread adoption of 5G cellular technology is becoming the major driver for the growth of IoT-based applications. In this paper we consider a Mobile Service Provider (MSP) that launches a smart city service based on IoT data readings. In order to serve IoT data collected across different locations, the MSP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across regional sites and IoT data collection patterns.We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of MSPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the MSP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the MSP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data."
8854858,Multiplierless Filtered-OFDM Transmitter for Narrowband IoT Devices,"In cyclic-prefix orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CP-OFDM)-based radio access, the coexistence of different technologies without precise time-frequency synchronization is limited due to high out-of-band (OOB) emissions. Therefore, the spectrum enhancement techniques play a key role in relaxing the synchronization and power control requirements. This allows a higher degree of opportunistic spectrum use with minimized interference. In addition, all the transmitting devices have to fulfill specific transmitted signal quality requirements, including the maximum OOB radiated signal power. With the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based radio access, some additional signal processing for improved spectrum containment is commonly needed to achieve these requirements. The filtering and time-domain windowing are two fundamentally different approaches for spectrum enhancement. The filtered OFDM (F-OFDM) provides better spectrum localization than the time-windowing schemes [such as windowed overlap-add (WOLA)], with the cost of higher complexity. This article introduces low-complexity solutions for spectrally enhanced narrowband OFDM transmitters based on the use of lookup tables (LUTs). The proposed LUT approach, requiring only memory units and a low number of additions, allows to avoid all computationally expensive operations in online transmitter processing, as it builds the transmitted signal by summing the stored partial waveforms optimized offline. In certain cases, completely multiplication- and summation-free designs are possible. The transmitters of narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) devices are natural applications for the proposed LUT approach, as they require additional digital baseband signal processing to reach the emission requirements. It is shown that the proposed LUT schemes can provide significant savings in real-time computations of NB-IoT devices, while fulfilling the 3GPP requirements."
8630586,Waveform and Space Precoding for Next Generation Downlink Narrowband IoT,"Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) was introduced by 3GPP in low power wide area network to support low power and wide coverage applications. Since it follows long term evolution standard, its signal quality is guaranteed and its deployment is straightforward via reusing existing infrastructures. Current NB-IoT supports low data rate services via using low order modulation formats for the purpose of power saving. However, with the increase of data rate driven applications, next generation NB-IoT would require data rate enhancement techniques without consuming extra battery power. In this paper, a downlink framework, using a nonorthogonal signal waveform for next generation enhanced NB-IoT (eNB-IoT), is proposed and experimentally tested in both single-antenna and multiantenna systems. In the single-antenna scenario, waveform precoding is used to pre-equalize the self-created inter carrier interference distorted signal waveform. For the multiantenna multiuser scenario, both waveform and antenna space precoding have to be used. Measured results show that in both single-antenna and multiantenna systems, the proposed signal waveform in eNB-IoT can increase data rate by ~11% compared with NB-IoT occupying the same spectral resource in similar receiver computational complexity."
9547115,Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in 5G from the Energy Efficiency Perspective,"5G communications represent a large ecosystem of several use cases with very different requirements and characteristics. For this reason, analyses based on capacity and robustness are not fully representative, and different aspects such as energy consumption, interference management, or latency must be taken into account. Specifically, energy consumption and efficiency are of special relevance in future wireless communications due to the requirements of the receivers. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques have shown significant system capacity and reliability gains compared to Time Domain Multiple Access (TDMA). However, its energy impact in broadcast/unicast convergence networks has not been studied. This work analyzes the impact of using jointly 5G and NOMA from the transmitter and the receiver point of view. On the one hand, it is proposed to use the gain provided by NOMA to reduce the transmitted power while offering the same services as in TDMA. The receiver analysis considers different use cases: fixed receivers of individualized quality improvement services, mobile video receivers, and IoT devices. The evaluation metrics are energy efficiency and consumption. The results indicate that NOMA provides gains from the transmitter point of view and reduces the energy consumption of sporadic content downloads. On the contrary, TDMA is a better candidate from the receiver enerav efficiency point of view."
9128505,Asynchronous Scrambled Coded Multiple Access for 5G Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: System Level Performance,"Asynchronous Scrambled Coded Multiple Access (ASCMA) technology presents several features that make it well suited for IoT and mMTC type applications over state-of-the-art terrestrial wireless networks. These include low-rate error correction coding combined with low complexity receiver processing and an ability to transmit data asynchronously using single as well as multiple-streams from a user terminal. The resulting advantages in terms of spectral efficiency, low-latency, and reduced power consumption have been quantified previously using link-level simulations. In this paper, we evaluate the system level performance of a 5G New Radio (NR) mobile network employing ASCMA for uplink mMTC type applications. Using an accurate system level simulator, we evaluate two different scheduling schemes for ASCMA, the first assumes a grant-based scheduling of user terminals over available network resources and the second assumes random access or grant-free scheduling of the same. A novel abstraction method is developed to aid the system level evaluations. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate the ability of ASCMA technology to provide significant improvements to key network performance indicators such as packet loss rate, average retransmission rate, average cell throughput and cell-edge throughput."
8848540,Joint Congestion Control and Resource Allocation for Massive MTC in 5G Networks Based on SCMA,"The massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) usage scenario, also known as massive Internet of Things (mIoT), involves a large number of MTC devices having high requirements on increased battery lifetime, which autonomously transfer small amounts of data with relaxed delay requirements, without human intervention. The current cellular network is unsuitable for this scenario, due to the limited uplink resources allocated to the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) and to the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH). With this in mind, in this paper we propose a new framework, customized for massive MTC services, that includes a joint control of the dynamic resource allocation between the PRACH and the PUSCH, and a new random access procedure based on an adaptive Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme that appropriately spreads random access re-attempts in time. In addition, to further increase the transmission efficiency, we adopt the Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) technique for PUSCH resources, because SCMA results as the most promising Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique to support massive MTC connectivity with small-size data. Simulation results show that the proposed control framework significantly improves the number of succeeded communications and guarantees lower energy consumption in comparison with other proposals available in literature."
9685419,PFCC: Predictive Fast Consensus Convergence for Mobile Blockchain over 5G Slicing-enabled IoT,"As the security requirements increases, 5G slicing-enabled Internet of things needs to adopt end-to-end standalone networking, which limits the consensus convergence of mobile blockchain. Although the rise of FIBRE (Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine) gives a huge promotion to block propagation, existing approaches cannot consider the influence of link outages among 5G slices on mobile blockchain. In this paper, we focus on decreasing the block propagation time among blockchain peers under the scenario where link outages among 5G slices exist. A predictive fast consensus convergence (PFCC) scheme is proposed for mobile blockchain over 5G slicing-enabled internet of things. In PFCC, federated semi-supervised learning is used to learn the features of withdraw packets, reroutes the packets of blockchain peers, and ultimately reduces the scale of link outages quickly. With PFCC, different blockchain peers located in standalone 5G slices of IoT can transact local sensing data more efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the consensus convergence speed of mobile blockchain by optimizing communications between 5G slices. Experiments shows the feasibility of proposed scheme."

It is also a key enabler for ultra-reliable and low-latency (URLL) communications. Moreover, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm has emerged to practically provide massive connectivity for smart devices and systems, which entails spectrum- and energy-efficient transmission schemes. To this aim, NOMA and energy-harvesting (EH) solutions have been put forth to address such demands, making the combination of such technologies inevitable in NOMA-based URLL-EH-IoT networks. On the other hand, random-access (RA) techniques are the key solution to enable massive URLL-EH-IoT networks, since they reduce signaling overhead, packet latency, and energy consumption when massive numbers of clustered IoT devices with sporadic traffic behavior are considered. In this paper, uplink RA-NOMA in URLL-EH-IoT networks with short packet and diversity transmissions is studied and analyzed. Network metrics-such as average packet latency, reliability, and GoodPut-are derived for the RA-NOMA scenario and compared with its RA-OMA counterpart to explore the advantages of RA-NOMA over RA-OMA. Moreover, the analytical derivations have been validated and shown to coincide with the simulation results. Furthermore, the effect of the transmission diversity and number of data bits per blocklength on the different network metrics are extensively evaluated. Lastly, the analytical derivations are utilized to find the optimum values of the IoT nodes' transmit power, number of packet replicas, and number of transmitted data bits per blocklength, such that the maximum sum-GoodPut of a RA-NOMA IoT cluster is achieved, subject to URLL constraints."

Spectrum limitation in the deployment of 5G currently becomes a challenge in Indonesia. One of the spectrums that potentially for the early 5G deployment in Indonesia is the 3.4-3.7 GHz band known as the Ext. C-Band. This band is currently being utilized by 5 satellites. Therefore the reallocation process and the allocation of compensation carried out towards the satellite operator by assuming that 200 MHz bandwidth is used for 5G from 3.4 GHz-3.6 GHz frequency and 100 MHz guard band from 3.6 GHz-3.7 GHz frequency. Compensation calculation was conducted by using GHz band approach to find out what the techno-economics value of this method is and whether there is a solution to the problem if the model is applied in Indonesia. The obtained result of the research was the income compensation is 2 times greater than the cost compensation. The spectrum license fee value of 3.5 GHz frequency per 100 MHz is IDR 3.098 trillion. In the case of the NPV value business of each compensation for 10 years shows a positive value. This scenario can be a good solution for satellites operator and regulator as well as cellular operator because it can help improve the financial health of operator in the deployment of 5G.

9590534,NB-IoT Random Access for Non-Terrestrial Networks: Preamble Detection and Uplink Synchronization,"The satellite component is recognized as a promising solution to complement and extend the coverage of future Internet of things (IoT) terrestrial networks (TNs). In this context, a study item to integrate satellites into narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) systems has been approved within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization body. However, as NB-IoT systems were initially conceived for TNs, their basic design principles and operation might require some key modifications when incorporating the satellite component. These changes in NB-IoT systems, therefore, need to be carefully implemented in order to guarantee a seamless integration of both TN and non-terrestrial network (NTN) for a global coverage. This paper addresses this adaptation for the random access (RA) step in NB-IoT systems, which is in fact the most challenging aspect in the NTN context, for it deals with multi-user time-frequency synchronization and timing advance for data scheduling. In particular, we propose an RA technique which is robust to typical satellite channel impairments, including long delays, significant Doppler effects, and wide beams, without requiring any modification to the current NB-IoT RA waveform. Performance evaluations demonstrate the proposal’s capability of addressing different NTN configurations recently defined by 3GPP for the 5G new radio system."

UFMC is a multicomponent network modulation technique (5G). In this paper we discuss the different modulation technologies for 5 G technology and support the need for UFMC technology in wireless 5 G communication. Some drawbacks such as lateral band leakage, high Peak to Average Power ratio (PAPR) and spectrum utilization are used to decreases the performance of the system in 4 G OFDM modulation technique. Though, with the introduction of Internet of Things (IOT) and the transition to user-centered computing, it is difficult to utilize the OFDM methodology. There are still some problems in realistic terms of a single-carrier strategy called filter bank multi carrier (FBMC) which is stronger than OFDM. And a switch to a separate strategy named Universal Filtered Multi Carrier (UFMC) is used due to efficient usage of the spectrum by considering the formats above. This article also explains the PAPR reduction method in 5G waveform (UFMC). The usages of the UFMC waveform in 5G system to achieve the requirements are many useful than the OFDM waveform."

With the proliferation of aerial IoT devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), interference characteristics in 3D environments will be different than those in the existing terrestrial IoT networks. In this paper, we consider 3D topology IoT networks with a mixture of aerial and terrestrial links, with low-cost cross-dipole antennas at ground nodes and both omni-directional and cross-dipole antennas at aerial nodes. Considering a massive-access communication scenario, we first derive the statistics of the channel gain at IoT receivers in closed form while taking into account the radiation patterns of both ground and aerial nodes. These are then used to calculate the ergodic achievable rate as a function of the height of the aerial receiver and the cumulative interference. We propose a low-complexity interference mitigation scheme that utilizes 3D antenna radiation pattern with different dipole antenna settings. Our results show that using the proposed scheme, the ergodic achievable rate improves as the height of the aerial receivers increases. In addition, we also show that the ratio between the ground and aerial receivers that maximizes the peak rate increases with the height of the aerial IoT receiver."

In this type of service, latency is one of the key element. 5G and VLC are both technologies that can provide ultra-low latency services. In this paper, we describe an original experiment: a VLC link between traffic-light and vehicle, supported by a 5G network. In particular, IoT sensors data flows are gathered together by the 5G network and sent to the traffic-light which sends this information to the vehicle by modulating the light (VLC). The results show that the joint use of 5G and VLC can provide very low latency at the receiver."

Moreover, NOMA is a potential solution, to be incorporated in future releases of 5G, to increase the capacity required to support extremely high number of Internet of Things (IoT). It is shown that combining NOMA with SC-FDE and mMIMO only suffers a moderate degradation, while a capacity gain is achieved due to the sharing of the spectrum."
9708301,Development of an Algorithm for Reducing Signalling Overhead Cost in 5G Networks,"The 5G mobile networks aim to accomplish the austere requirements on data rates, reliability, and connectivity. In order to achieve these objectives, heterogeneous radio access technologies are used. In order to use the technology efficiently, massive connectivity of devices has been proposed in 3GPP Release 15. In the stand alone architecture, small base stations are deployed without any dependency on LTE core network. Increase in the number of devices will lead to an increase in signalling overhead consisting of tracking area update and paging overhead. This paper proposes an approach to reduce the signalling cost using clustering algorithm. The base stations form clusters using the proposed algorithm, and act as static cluster heads. The clustering algorithm is used to connect different types of User Equipments (UEs), including the vehicles, machines and various stationary IoT devices. In addition, this paper also deals with a hybrid scenario which represents the unification of both the layers (LTE and NR) for the initial rollout of the 5G to fill the coverage gaps. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides better performance in terms of reduced energy consumption by the UEs."

9547348,Opportunistic Federation of CubeSat Constellations: a Game-Changing Paradigm Enabling Enhanced IoT Services in the Sky,"Internet of Space Things (IoST) is a challenging paradigm, which is currently attracting great interest from the scientific and industrial communities. IoST is based on the integration of the space segment into the global Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure. In the relevant literature, reference is generally made to multiple constellations of nanosatellite platforms, used to enable IoT services on a global scale, including also disadvantaged and poorly infrastructured areas. In this paper, we focus on multi-tenant IoT scenarios, wherein multiple CubeSats constellations are enabled to offer services by exploiting a dynamic federation model. The objective is to efficiently provide services in an IoST scenario by leveraging an effective cooperation strategy originally designed for terrestrial IoT networks, the Mobile-IoT-Federation-as-a-Service (MIFaaS) paradigm. We extend this vision to IoT satellite networks in order to allow a constellation of satellites to effectively execute tasks through a tight cooperative behaviour with other CubeSats constellations. The reported performance evaluation studies show that better performance, in terms of percentage of tasks successfully completed, can be achieved through the implementation of the proposed cooperation paradigm."
8772198,Cross-Layer Design for Mission-Critical IoT in Mobile Edge Computing Systems,"In this paper, we establish a cross-layer framework for optimizing user association, packet offloading rates, and bandwidth allocation for mission-critical Internet-of-Things (MC-IoT) services with short packets in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, where enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services with long packets are considered as background services. To reduce communication delay, the fifth generation new radio is adopted in radio access networks. To avoid long queueing delay for short packets from MC-IoT, processor-sharing (PS) servers are deployed at MEC systems, where the service rate of the server is equally allocated to all the packets in the buffer. We derive the distribution of latency experienced by short packets in closed form, and minimize the overall packet loss probability subject to the end-to-end delay requirement. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, we propose an algorithm that converges to a near optimal solution when the throughput of eMBB services is much higher than MC-IoT services, and extend it into more general scenarios. Furthermore, we derive the optimal solutions in two asymptotic cases: communication or computing is the bottleneck of reliability. The simulation and numerical results validate our analysis and show that the PS server outperforms first-come-first-serve servers."

In the mobile network, users need to choose appropriate slices for access. Its performance is related to the quality of service and determines the efficiency of system resources utilization. We research the problem of slice re-access and slice resource scheduling caused by user mobility in 5G network slicing architecture and propose a slice access mechanism based on maximum throughput. A slice access selection algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. Related simulations and comparative tests are carried out to prove the effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm."

Content sharing through the device to device (D2D) multicast communication can effectively mitigate the burden of the cellular network and add to network capacity.

9032144,Identity-Based Signature With Server-Aided Verification Scheme for 5G Mobile Systems,"Recently, security and privacy issues in mobile communication systems became an enormous challenge due to the limited resources of mobile networks regarding communication overhead, computational cost, and battery power. 5G systems provide high performance and flexibility that can connect billion of objects through Heterogeneous Wireless Networks (HWN) concerning the Internet of Things (IoT). However, some of these security challenges can be addressed by using outsourced assistants such as Server-Aided Verification (SAV) to contribute partially with the authentication process among 5G network entities.

In this context, several key issues for 5G communications should be considered to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) user selection and resource allocation are considered as an important key issues for Internet of Things (IoT) communications. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive V2X users selection and resource allocation for Ultra-Dense 5G HetNet network (AU-HetNet). AU-HetNet consists on two stages; Vehicle Selection Stage (VSS) and Adaptive Resource Allocation Stage (ARAS). The first stage defines the selected vehicle that will be served based on an utility function results to designate the set of candidate vehicles and a maximum throughput of each vehicle. The second stage concerns the adaptive resource allocation model which is based on QoS priority in order to privilege real time and non-real-time traffics.

Rooted in LTE, NB-IoT introduces several innovation aimed at meeting the 5G IoT requirements, especially in terms of capacity. Already a commercial success with 94 deployments in over 35 countries, the performance of NB-IoT remains, however, poorly understood.In this paper, we introduce a theoretical model based on M/D/1-PS queues for assessing the performance of NB-IoT as function of different network settings and protocol configurations. Our model is the first to accurately capture the random access procedure for connection establishment (the contention phase) and the entire communicate process, with signalling, connection release and uplink, downlink messages (the congestion phase).After using simulations to demonstrate its accuracy, we use our model to assess the performance of NB-IoT as function of its key parameters. Our analysis reveals a) the NPRACH/NPUSCH ratio has to be chosen carefully and take into account the traffic distribution, and b) for small packet sizes, the NB-IoT signalling becomes a significant bottleneck to the number of UEs that can be supported."

In this framework, massive connectivity represents one of the key issues. This is especially relevant when IoT systems are expected to cover a large geographical area or a region not reached by terrestrial network connections. In such scenarios, the usage of satellites might represent a viable solution for providing wide area coverage and connectivity in a flexible and affordable manner.

9569635,5G QoS Flow Migration Over URLLC Relays,"Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), a key area of 5G, is designed to support dependable and time-sensitive communications. Yet when addressing Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, traditional 5G does not consider delay spread an interference metric reported back to the base station (as delay spread approaches the duration of the cyclic prefix, the channel capacity decreases due to inter-symbol interference). As IoT equipment may lack the processing capability to mitigate delay spread’s effects, not accounting for delay spread in reported channel condition metrics can result in resources not being assigned in an efficient manner.For out-of-coverage remote devices, such as in smart factories and Industrial Internet of Things [1] (IIoT), Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) small cells or Layer 3 User Equipment (UE) to Network (UE-to-Network) relays must be relied on to extend the network to localized areas. Due to power domain NOMA’s Resource Block (RB) multiplexing, in a multi-level NOMA system the impact of delay spread on the set of viable resource allocations becomes more evident as the interference generated can render 2nd level RBs unusable. Consequently, the likelihood of achieving URLLC’s low End-to-End Radio Latency requirements becomes more difficult in multi-level NOMA systems.In this paper we investigate a tractable methodology to mitigate the impact of delay spread and improve the End-to-End latency of IIoT devices via 5G NOMA multicast flow numerology migration for URLLC NOMA relays used in a non-public network. We derive a theoretically optimal integer linear programming (ILP) resource allocation algorithm and present a tractable low-complexity approximation algorithm, 5G Multicast Flow Migration over NOMA (5GMFMN). In terms of end-to-end radio latency, our evaluation shows 5GMFMN yields results similar to ILP, and both algorithms can yield over 4× improvement over traditional 5G at a max delay spread of 2.1µs.

Achieving ultra-low latency is one of the fundamental goals for 5G wireless networks to enable new services and applications such as, virtual reality, live content streaming, automated vehicle control, internet of things (IoT) where machines and tools can be controlled remotely with extreme response, and many delay sensitive applications over the mobile network. This paper investigates hybrid strategy of traffic dispersion and network densification, which aims to split and transmit an arrival traffic over multiple different paths within the ultra-dense network. This improved the capacity of, and reduced the communication delay in, planned 5G-wireless network for urban area in Taiz city, Yemen. For our proposed 5G-wireless network there are 376 microcells, which operates using millimeter-Wave (mm-Wave) with the 73 GHz band, and used as providers for 274702 subscribers within the covered urban area of Taiz city. The planned 5G-network is carried out using OMNET++ and MATLAB simulation tools, hence the performance of this network is evaluated by key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average throughput, and communication delay. Based on the obtained results the amount of network throughput has reached a high value, up to 9 Gbps at each cell, with 88% probability that average one hop delay less than 0.5 ms."
9592432,Efficient Mobility Support Services for Highly Mobile Devices in 5G Networks,"Cellular networks have to provide continuous network connectivity services to mobile devices. 5G networks are expected to support a huge number of highly mobile devices, roaming seamlessly across very small cells. Consequently, the handover rate for these extremely dense networks is expected to be very high. To reduce the burden caused by rapid handover requests, this study suggests a scalable cellular mobility management scheme, aiming to support a massive number of highly mobile devices in 5G and beyond networks. This goal is achieved by partitioning the mobile devices into proximity-based clusters established hierarchically and using the concept of nomadic cells.Previous distributed mobility management schemes are not sufficiently efficient to support the rate of handover requests expected for 5G networks. Due to their high computational complexity, previous group-based methods are not applicable for real-time services.

9514451,A First Look at Energy Consumption of NB-IoT in the Wild: Tools and Large-Scale Measurement,"Recent years have seen a widespread deployment of NB-IoT networks for massive machine-to-machine communication in the emerging 5G era. Unfortunately, the key aspects of NB-IoT networks, such as radio access performance and power consumption have not been well-understood due to lack of effective tools and closed nature of operational cellular infrastructure. In this paper, we develop NB-Scope - the first hardware NB-IoT diagnostic tool that supports fine-grained fusion of power and protocol traces. We then conduct a large-scale field measurement study consisting of 30 nodes deployed at over 1,200 locations in 4 regions during a period of three months. Our in-depth analysis of the collected 49 GB traces showed that NB-IoT nodes yield significantly imbalanced energy consumption in the wild, up to a ratio of 75:1, which may lead to short battery lifetime and frequent network partition. Such a high performance variance can be attributed to several key factors including diverse network coverage levels, long tail power profile, and excessive control message repetitions. We then explore the optimization of NB-IoT base station settings on a software-defined eNodeB testbed, and suggest several important design aspects that can be considered by future NB-IoT specifications and chipsets."

Besides that, the modulator presents the lowest power consumption compared with the state of the art. An extensive estimation of error vector magnitude (EVM) values for different frequencies and modulations (16, 32, and 64-QAM) is presented.

8961191,5G-Enabled Fault Detection and Diagnostics: How Do We Achieve Efficiency?,"The fifth-generation (5G) wireless network technologies and mobile-edge computing (MEC) provide great promises of enabling new capabilities for the industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, the solutions enabled by the 5G ultrareliable low-latency communication (URLLC) paradigm come with challenges, where URLLC alone does not necessarily guarantee the efficient execution of time-critical fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) applications. Based on the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process model, we propose the concept of the communication-edge-computing (CEC) loop and a system model for evaluating the efficiency of FDD applications. We then formulate an optimization problem for achieving the defined CEC efficiency and discuss some typical solutions to the generic CEC-based FDD services (FDDS) and propose a new uplink (UL)-based communication protocol called “ReFlexUp.” From the performance analysis and numerical results, the proposed ReFlexUp protocol shows its effectiveness compared to the typical protocols, such as Selective Repeat automatic repeat request (ARQ), hybrid ARQ (HARQ), and “Occupy CoW” in terms of the key metrics, such as latency, reliability, and efficiency. These results are further convinced from the mmWave-based simulations in a typical 5G MEC-based implementation."

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided network is emerging as a promising technique to overcome the above challenges. In this paper, an emergency communications framework of NOMA-based UAV-aided networks is established, where the disasters scenarios can be divided into three broad categories that have named emergency areas, wide areas and dense areas. First, a UAV-enabled uplink NOMA system is established to gather information from IoT devices in emergency areas. Then, a joint UAV deployment and resource allocation scheme for a multi-UAV enabled NOMA system is developed to extend the UAV coverage for IoT devices in wide areas.

In this study, a novel 3D convolutional neural networks is proposed for beam selection in a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) application scenario, which is based on 5G mmWave communication system and Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform than the previous methods."
8851617,A UL-NOMA system providing low E2E latency,"The 5G (5th generation mobile communications systems) will not only realize high speed and high capacity communication but also support the Internet of Things (IoT). To support IoT, it is important that a base station (BS) of 5G is able to deal with massive uplink signals transmitted from IoT devices. In addition, some IoT devices used for automatic operation require low latency communication. Therefore, low latency communication is also important to support IoT. We have developed techniques based on non-orthogonal multiple access in uplink (UL-NOMA) in order to realize both massive device connectivity and low latency. Although we could not measure the delay time between an UE transmitting uplink data and receiving downlink data (E2E latency) because of no downlink signal in our previous system, we developed a downlink system and an application to measure E2E latency, and measured E2E latency at this time. We conducted the experiment using hardware to evaluate the E2E latency. Under the condition of Rician and Nakagami fading with K factor = 20 dB, we confirm that the probability that our system can achieve an E2E latency of 20 ms or less is about 90% when two UEs send the uplink signals. In the case of three UEs, the probability is about 50%."

The chosen operating frequency is 38 GHz which also lies in the mm-wave band. This paper discusses two antennas. The first antenna is designed using polyimide film and the other using polyimide film as a superstate with Rogers RT 5880 as the main substrate. The first antenna exhibits an intensive radiation absorption of 38.7 W/kg for every 10g of tissue, which is mitigated by the design of the second antenna. Therefore, the second antenna is analyzed for on-body humidity sensing. Due to polyimide's high sensitivity towards humidity, any change in humidity is detectable through the changes in the dielectric constant of polyimide and changes in the resonant frequency."
9356513,A High-End IoT Devices Framework to Foster Beyond-Connectivity Capabilities in 5G/B5G Architecture,"The impressive advancements in embedded systems and the integration of new types of smart devices into the Internet of Things (IoT) continue to revolutionize the communication technologies. Gradually, such devices are enriched with additional capabilities (e.g., sense, learn, reason, move, act on the environment) beyond classic connectivity services. However, there are no unified and coherent software architectures to seamlessly integrate and manage high-end devices. This work envisages a novel architectural framework, ITHACA: IoT High-end Autonomous Cooper-Ative framework, for 5G and beyond communications toward seamless integration of autonomous and intelligent devices. The framework offers necessary functional enrichments on top of existing architecture involving functions, mechanisms, algorithms, and protocols. The usefulness of the proposed ITHACA framework is corroborated considering a recent Industry 4.0 use case of aerial robotics pertaining to design of an intelligent industrial infrastructure inspection system."

However, as the rapid growth of IoT connections, personalized requirements of services requested and heterogeneity deepening of the network system, how to design an intelligent network selection scheme for user devices (UDs) is becoming a crucial challenge in the 5G heterogeneous network system. Most of the existing network selection methods only optimize the selection strategies from the user side or network side, which results in heavy network congestion, poor user experience, and system performance degradation. Accordingly, we propose a multiagent
Q
-learning network selection (MAQNS) algorithm based on Nash
Q
-learning, which can learn a joint optimal selection strategy to improve system throughput and reduce user blocking on the premise of ensuring the requirements of IoT services. In particular, we apply the discrete-time Markov chains to model the network selection, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and gray relation analysis (GRA) are jointly utilized to obtain user preferences for each network. Finally, performance evaluation demonstrates that comparing to the existing schemes, MAQNS proposed cannot only improve system throughput and reduce user blocking but also promote user experience on average energy efficiency and delay."

The service distribution challenge is becoming more evident and a need for better service options is emerging. The focus of the work is to optimize issues related to the allocation of resources in Edge Computing, improving the quality of service (QoS) with new methodologies. An algorithm based on a bio-inspired model was developed. This algorithm is based on the behavior of gray wolves and it is called Algorithm for 5G Resource Management Optmization in Edge Computing (GROMEC). The algorithm uses the meta-heuristic technique applied to Edge Computing, to result in a better allocation resources through user equipment (UE). The resources considered for allocation in that work are processing, memory, time and storage. Two genetic algorithms were used to define the fitness of an Edge in relation to the resource. Two other algorithms that use traditional techniques in the literature, the Best-First and AHP methods, were considered in the evaluation and comparison with the GROMEC. In the function used to calculate fitness during the simulation made with the GROMEC, the proposed algorithm had a lower number of denied services, presented a low number of blocks and was able to meet the largest number of UEs allocating on average up to 50% more in relation to the Best and 5.25% in relation to Nancy."

In this paper, we investigate a new radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting based on the distinctive signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) trace in the sector level sweep (SLS) procedure of 5G IEEE 802.11ad devices. This SLS SNR trace-based fingerprinting can directly apply to offthe- shelf devices without any extra hardware requirements and be independent of the wireless channel and environment. To tackle the orientation change challenge, we proposed a novel fingerprinting framework, involving correlation analysis, surface fitting, curve pursuing, and binary classification, named CSCB framework. Using this framework, the proposed SLS SNR tracebased fingerprinting can achieve device authentication at any orientation with one receiver under line-of-sight (LOS) or nonline-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. We conduct proof-of-concept experiments using off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices (Talon AD7200 and MG360 WiGig) to evaluate the performance of the proposed fingerprinting schemes.

To unleash its full potential, end devices are expected to work in a plug-and-play fashion, with zero or minimal configuration of parameters, still exhibiting excellent energy efficiency. We performed the most comprehensive set of empirical measurements with commercial IoT devices and different operators to date, quantifying the impact of several parameters to energy consumption. Our findings prove that parameters' settings do impact energy consumption, so proper configuration is necessary. We shed light on this aspect by first illustrating how the nominal standard operational modes map into real current consumption patterns of NB-IoT devices. Furthermore, we investigated which device-reported metadata metrics better reflected performance and implemented an algorithm to automatically identify device state in the current time-series logs. We worked with two major western European operators to provide a measurement-driven analysis of energy consumption and network performance of two popular NB-IoT boards under different parameter configurations. We observed that energy consumption is mostly affected by the paging interval in connected state, set by the base station. However, not all operators correctly implement such settings. Furthermore, under the default configuration, energy consumption in not strongly affected by packet size nor by signal quality, unless it is extremely bad. Our observations indicate that simple modifications to the default parameters' settings can yield great energy savings."

In order to improve power efficiency, 3GPP proposed a new random access (RA) waveform for NB-IoT based on a single-tone frequency-hopping scheme. RA handles the first connection between user equipments (UEs) and the base station (BS). Through this, UEs can be identified and synchronized with the BS. In this context, receiver methods for the detection of the new waveform should satisfy the requirements on the successful user detection as well as the timing synchronization accuracy. This is not a trivial task, especially in the presence of radio impairments like carrier frequency offset (CFO) which constitutes one of the main radio impairments besides the noise. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a new receiver method for NB-IoT physical RA channel (NPRACH). The method is designed to eliminate perfectly the CFO without any additional computational complexity and supports all NPRACH preamble formats. The associated performance has been evaluated under 3GPP conditions. We observe a very high performance compared both to 3GPP requirements and to the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and complexity."

It will support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and enable new applications in health, banking, education, etc. Security is essential in this network because vulnerabilities may be exploited to disrupt these applications which may directly impact our life. Authentication and key agreement (AKA) and handover (HO) are usually the target of cyberattacks in any cellular network. On the other hand, blockchain is a peer-to-peer network that aims to maintain an immutable and secure ledger. This new technology will be used widely to secure many applications. This paper aims to develop an efficient and secure AKA scheme and uniform handover protocol for 5G network using blockchain. The home network (HN) is not involved in the AKA scheme and HO protocol to protect the HN from attacks, such as denial of service (DoS) attacks, and also lower the communication and computation overhead. Moreover, our HO protocol is uniform in the sense that it can be used for all HO scenarios. The protocol is also efficient because it requires exchanging a few amount of data. It can also achieve forward/backward secrecy. Furthermore, the blockchain is used to verify the public keys of the network nodes which is necessary to secure our AKA scheme and HO protocol. It also records the locations of the users which is necessary for the functionality of the network. Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed HO protocol is secure, uniform, and can achieve the forward/backward secrecy. Furthermore, our AKA scheme requires lower computation and computation overhead comparing to the existing schemes, and preserves the energy of the limited-energy mobile devices."

Increased data transfer speeds, reduced latency, and extended bandwidths enable the true power of 5G networks. To support increased bandwidths cellular industry looked to high-frequency bands with high data rates in the spectrum above 24 GHz which are typically called “millimeter waves”. The introduction of millimeter waves reduces the coverage radius drastically due to high penetration losses and the blocking nature of this wave spectrum. The reduced coverage radius causes higher infrastructure costs for the network providers. This research will focus on a crowdsourcing mechanism where network data is collected through a mobile application and use this data to generate a real-time network coverage map. In addition, collected data will be used to predict future network quality demands and locations for cell towers with the help of machine learning technologies. The outcome of this research will be beneficial to network providers to reduce infrastructure costs by optimally laying infrastructures."

The Quality of Network Services (QoNS) of the future 5G and 6G networks are aiming to address all possible types of flexible user demands optimally. Telecom. Service Providers (TSPs) are rigorously looking for suitable network architectures that can assist them to realize such user-friendly systems. vSDN or virtualized Software Defined Network Architecture is the key technology enabler that makes such functionalities possible. In the recent paradigm shift where everything is being based on IoT, service availability and system stability are two major concerns. For keeping the quality index of the network services high, it is essential to orchestrate and deploy the network infrastructures that will provide additional and upgraded network services. Keeping these fundamental issues in mind, in this work, we have proposed a novel multi-instance deployment strategy for Controllers and Hypervisors over an actual network topology. While defining the work, our prime concern targets improving service availability within the ULL (Ultra-Low Latency) environment.

While we are excited about the delay-free high speeds 5G will bring, security problems are becoming more and more serious. Increasingly rampant Distributed Denial of service (DDoS) attacks, particularly Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DrDoS) attacks with User Datagram Protocols (UDPs) have developed into a global problem. This article presents a design, implementation, analysis, and experimental evaluation of an authentication scheme, a defense against UDP DrDoS attacks, by which attackers cleverly use rebound server farms to bounce a flood of packets to a target host. We call our solution IEWA because it combines the concepts of increasing expenses and weak authentication. In this paper, we apply IEWA to Network Time Protocol (NTP). First, we simulate and compare the original and improved protocols. Next, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. We show that our improved scheme is safer than the original scheme. Finally, we compare our solution with existing state-of-the-art schemes, using indicators such as communication overhead, server storage costs, client storage costs, computation costs of server and computation costs of client. We find that our scheme improves system stability and security, reduces communication overhead, server storage cost and computational costs. Our solution not only improves the NTP protocol to mitigate DrDoS attacks, but also strengthens other UDP protocols that are vulnerable to DrDoS attacks. Therefore, our solution can be used as a solution to UDP DrDoS attacks in 5G Networks."

In this paper, we demonstrate an advanced lightweight compliant environmental monitoring system: ""Marine-Skin"" with enhanced sensing and logging capabilities, having soft-packaging and endurance up to a depth of 2 km in highly saline Red sea water for multiple weeks. Unlike invasive biologgers, we demonstrate a unique non-invasive attachment strategy by designing a wearable jacket from soft-polymers that can be adhered to any species irrespective of their skin type. We have successfully deployed the feather-light (<;0.5g in air, 3g with jacket) wearable gadget on Wobbegong shark, Seabream, and common Goldfish to demonstrate the non-invasive and pragmatic attachment mechanism for different species of variable sizes without any hindrance to natural movement or behavior of animal tagged."
8951149,5G Vehicular Network Resource Management for Improving Radio Access Through Machine Learning,"The current cellular technology and vehicular networks cannot satisfy the mighty strides of vehicular network demands. Resource management has become a complex and challenging objective to gain expected outcomes in a vehicular environment. The 5G cellular network promises to provide ultra-high-speed, reduced delay, and reliable communications. The development of new technologies such as the network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) are critical enabling technologies leveraging 5G. The SDN-based 5G network can provide an excellent platform for autonomous vehicles because SDN offers open programmability and flexibility for new services incorporation. This separation of control and data planes enables centralized and efficient management of resources in a very optimized and secure manner by having a global overview of the whole network. The SDN also provides flexibility in communication administration and resource management, which are of critical importance when considering the ad-hoc nature of vehicular network infrastructures, in terms of safety, privacy, and security, in vehicular network environments. In addition, it promises the overall improved performance. In this paper, we propose a flow-based policy framework on the basis of two tiers virtualization for vehicular networks using SDNs. The vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication is quite possible with wireless virtualization where different radio resources are allocated to V2V communications based on the flow classification, i.e., safety-related flow or non-safety flows, and the controller is responsible for managing the overall vehicular environment and V2X communications. The motivation behind this study is to implement a machine learning-enabled architecture to cater the sophisticated demands of modern vehicular Internet infrastructures. The inclination towards robust communications in 5G-enabled networks has made it somewhat tricky to manage network slicing efficiently. This...

We first outline the motivation and challenges of such a scenario. Then, we illustrate our approach and present results derived from live measurements in a testbed deployed in the city of Turin within the 5G-EVE project.

9547167,5G SA Multi-vendor Network Interoperability Assessment,"Fifth Generation (5G) is the latest generation of mobile networks developed by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). This new generation aims to end the one network fits all paradigm by solving many use cases, such as ultra low latency, enhanced mobile broadband or massive machine communication as occurs in Internet of Things (IoT), that previous generations such as 4G do not support. In order to enable these use cases and make them elastic, agile and intelligent, the use of virtualization and softwarization technologies that can be applied in all parts of the mobile network makes a difference. However, although this new generation is not yet fully implemented, more and more solutions are appearing that allow the deployment of the complete own 5G private networks with specific requirements and characteristics. Among these solutions, some of them are open-source, which, unlike the commercial solutions, offer high flexibility to modify and adapt them to each situation. In this paper, we present an end-to-end multi-vendor 5G Standalone (SA) mobile network setup to validate the operation of a system comprised of different software both commercial and open-source. To perform this validation, an integration of different types of technologies has been carried out for each part of the mobile network architecture, combining commercial and open-source solutions. In addition, during this integration, the different solutions have been virtualized to simplify the deployment and management of the network. The result addresses interoperability between different solutions, as well as a comparison between them."
9042229,Genetic Algorithm for Holistic VNF-Mapping and Virtual Topology Design,"Next generation of Internet of Things (IoT) services imposes stringent requirements to the future networks that current ones cannot fulfill. 5G is a technology born to give response to those requirements. However, the deployment of 5G is also accompanied by profound architectural changes in the network, including the introduction of technologies like multi-access edge computing (MEC), software defined networking (SDN), and network function virtualization (NFV). In particular, NFV poses diverse challenges like virtual network function (VNF) placement and chaining, also called VNF-mapping. In this paper, we present an algorithm that solves VNF-placement and chaining in a metro WDM optical network equipped with MEC resources. Therefore, it solves the VNF-mapping in conjunction with the virtual topology design of the underlying optical backhaul network. Moreover, a version of the method providing protection against node failures is also presented. A simulation study is presented to show the importance of designing the three problems jointly, in contrast to other proposals of the literature that do not take the design of the underlying network into consideration when solving that problem. Furthermore, this paper also shows the advantages of using collaboration between MEC nodes to solve the VNF-mapping problem and the advantage of using shared protection schemes. The new algorithm outperforms other proposals in terms of both service blocking ratio, and number of active CPUs (thus reducing energy consumption). Finally, the impact of deploying different physical topologies for the optical backhaul network is also presented."

8635329,Efficient Fire Detection for Uncertain Surveillance Environment,"Tactile Internet can combine multiple technologies by enabling intelligence via mobile edge computing and data transmission over a 5G network. Recently, several convolutional neural networks (CNN) based methods via edge intelligence are utilized for fire detection in certain environment with reasonable accuracy and running time. However, these methods fail to detect fire in uncertain Internet of Things (IoT) environment having smoke, fog, and snow. Furthermore, achieving good accuracy with reduced running time and model size is challenging for resource constrained devices. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient CNN based system for fire detection in videos captured in uncertain surveillance scenarios. Our approach uses light-weight deep neural networks with no dense fully connected layers, making it computationally inexpensive. Experiments are conducted on benchmark fire datasets and the results reveal the better performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art. Considering the accuracy, false alarms, size, and running time of our system, we believe that it is a suitable candidate for fire detection in uncertain IoT environment for mobile and embedded vision applications during surveillance."

To deal with the new product projects decision problem, it is important to collect information to make the right decision at the initial stage of product development In past research, managers usually evaluate the product development projects (PDP) only based on its own resources. However, competitors can generate the similar products to compete in the market. Under this way, the PDP decision, is a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, should consider the internal and external factors. To address this MCDM problem, we propose a new method by combining the linguistic variables with intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on the intuitionistic fuzzy projection approach to analyze performance of PDPs. Then, a case example will implement to evaluate new kind of smart phone in order to fit with the 5 th generation mobile networks (5G) by using the proposed method.

The buzz is all about creating smart environments and getting every type of device connected to the internet. 5G will revolutionize the speed at which the data is transferred, and how much can be transferred at one time. Millimeterwave (mmWave) and massiveMIMO are the two key technologies which plays an essential role to address this problem and represents the next frontier of wireless technology, bringing 10 times higher frequencies and 10 times wider channel bandwidths than the most advanced Wi-Fi and cellular technologies. Millimeter-wave technology is going to become less expensive and easier to deploy, making it a candidate for many wireless connections, including backhaul, personal area networks and LANs. In the world of IoT, this translates into instant, reliable machine communication across every industry and application possible [1]. As the density of wireless devices increases and requirements of all their applications change drastically, it becomes more challenging to provide them connectivity within the stipulated amount of time to deliver the needs. As a result, several challenges such as improving the network capacity, coverage area, efficient data capturing, security, signal processing becomes a necessity to be handled. In line with these, a very recent area of research is to exploit mm-wave band for use in 5G IoT implementations unlike the traditional usage of Zigbee and Bluetooth technologies.

9121242,Sharing Distributed and Heterogeneous Resources toward End-to-End 5G Networks: A Comprehensive Survey and a Taxonomy,"Regardless of the context to which it is applied, sharing resources is well-recognized for its considerable benefits. Since 5G networks will be service-oriented, on-demand, and highly heterogeneous, it is utmost important to approach the design and optimization of the network from an end-to-end perspective. In addition, in order to ensure end-to-end performance, this approach has to entail both wireless and optical domains, altogether with the IoT, edge, and cloud paradigms which are an indispensable part of the 5G network architecture. Shifting from the exclusive ownership of network resources toward sharing enables all participants to cope with stringent service requirements in 5G networks, gaining significant performance improvements and cost savings at the same time. The main objective of this paper is to survey the literature on resource sharing, providing an in-depth and comprehensive perspective of sharing by recognizing the main trends, the techniques which enable sharing, and the challenges that need to be addressed. By providing a taxonomy which brings the relevant features of a comprehensive sharing model into focus, we aim to enable the creation of sharing models for more efficient future communication networks.

9339747,Key Technology Implementation of Poultry Breeding System for 5G Intelligent IOT,"As one of the key applications of the Internet of things technology, the development of intelligent breeding system has completely changed the traditional artificial feeding mode of poultry, used modern means to remote real-time monitor the environment of the breeding place, liberated the breeding personnel from the traditional heavy breeding work, and greatly improved the work efficiency. In this paper, the key technologies of 5g intelligent IoT poultry breeding system are studied.

On the basis of solving the storage and processing problems of massive perceptual data, the real-time collection and query of breeding process data, real-time monitoring of poultry growth status and poultry house environment, as well as the digital production and operation management of farms are realized, which provides scientific basis for poultry breeding managers to query, manage and make decisions on poultry information. A remote monitoring system of poultry breeding environment based on Internet of things is designed, which is convenient for poultry production managers to obtain and monitor the breeding environment information anytime and anywhere, without the limitation of time and place. Undoubtedly, the development of the system has important practical significance for the informatization and intelligent management of poultry production."
9306840,Secrecy Outage Probability of Relay Selection Based Cooperative NOMA for IoT Networks,"As an important partner of fifth generation (5G) communication, the internet of things (IoT) is widely used in many fields with its characteristics of massive terminals, intelligent processing, and remote control. In this paper, we analyze security performance for the cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks for IoT, where the multi-relay Wyner model with direct link between the base station and the eavesdropper is considered. In particular, secrecy outage probability (SOP) for two kinds of relay selection (RS) schemes (i.e., single-phase RS (SRS) and two-phase RS (TRS)) is developed in the form of closed solution. As a benchmark for comparison, the SOP for random RS (RRS) is also obtained. To gain more meaningful insights, approximate derivations of SOP under the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region are provided. Results of statistical simulation confirm the theoretical analysis and testify that: i) Compared with RRS scheme, SRS and TRS may improve secure performance because of obtaining smaller SOPs; ii) There exists secrecy performance floor for the SOP in strong SNR regime, which is dominated by NOMA protocol; iii) The security performance can be enhanced by augmenting the quantity of relays for SRS and TRS strategies. The purpose of this work is to provide theoretical basis for the analysis and design of anti-eavesdropping for NOMA systems in IoT."
8798806,Two-tier Architecture for NB-IoT: Improving Coverage and Load Balancing,"In the context of massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), 3GPP has introduced in Release 13 the Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) standard, that appears particularly suitable for uplink, delay-tolerant low-rate communications. On the one hand, being compatible with the existing 4G cellular systems, and also envisioned as a primary player in next 5G, NB-IoT is developed upon the existing heterogeneous architecture, formed by several overlapping tiers (HetNets), e.g. macro and small cells. On the other hand, in order to improve coverage and connection reliability in harsh environments, NB-IoT adopts its own coverage enhancement (CE) techniques, mainly based on signal repetition procedures, thus questioning the need of low-level tiers in such new communication scenario. This paper analyzes the performance of NB-IoT in a HetNets system, taking into account its specific features, and how they combine with a multi-tier architecture. The analysis is carried out by simulation, via proper adaptation of ns-3 simulator to the NB-IoT scenario. Results show that the use of a 2-tier dedicated architecture nicely combines with the NB-IoT CE technique, boosting system efficiency and coverage, while also triggering improved load balancing."
9745104,Aerial Intelligent Reflecting Surface Enabled Terahertz Covert Communications in Beyond-5G Internet of Things,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to be extensively employed for assisting wireless communications in the Internet of Things (IoT). On the other hand, terahertz (THz) enabled intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is expected to be one of the core enabling technologies for forthcoming beyond-5G wireless communications that promise a broad range of data-demand applications. In this paper, we propose a UAV-mounted IRS (UIRS) communication system over THz bands for confidential data dissemination from an access point (AP) towards multiple ground user equipments (UEs) in IoT networks. Specifically, the AP intends to send data to the scheduled UE, while unscheduled UEs may behave as potential adversaries. To protect information messages from the privacy preservation perspective, we aim to devise an energy-efficient multi-UAV covert communication scheme, where the UIRS is for reliable data transmissions, and an extra UAV is utilized as an aerial cooperative jammer, opportunistically generating artificial noise (AN) to degrade unscheduled UEs detection, leading to communication covertness improvement. This poses a novel max-min optimization problem in terms of minimum average energy efficiency (mAEE), aiming to improve covert throughput and reduce UAVs’ propulsion energy consumption, subject to satisfying some practical constraints such as the covertness requirements for which we obtain analytical expressions. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, we tackle it via the block successive convex approximation (BSCA) approach to iteratively solve a sequence of approximated convex sub-problems, designing the binary user scheduling, AP’s power allocation, maximum AN jamming power, IRS beamforming, and both UAVs’ trajectory and velocity planning. Finally, we present a low-complex overall algorithm for system performance enhancement with complexity and convergence analysis. Numerical results are provided to verify the analysis and demonstrate significant outperfo...

9354921,Design Guidelines for Blockchain-Assisted 5G-UAV Networks,"Fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are designed to meet various end-user quality of service (QoS) requirements through high data rates (typically of gigabits per second) and low latencies. Coupled with fog and mobile edge computing, 5G can achieve high data rates, enabling complex autonomous smart city services such as the large deployment of self-driving vehicles and large-scale artificial-intelligence-enabled industrial manufacturing. However, to meet the exponentially growing number of connected IoT devices and irregular data and service requests in both low- and high-density locations, the process of enacting traditional cells supported through fixed and costly base stations requires rethought to enable on-demand mobile access points in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for diversified smart city scenarios. This article envisions a 5G network environment that is supported by blockchain-enabled UAVs to meet dynamic user demands with network access supply. The solution enables decentralized service delivery (drones as a service) and routing to and from end users in a reliable and secure manner. Both public and private blockchains are deployed within the UAVs, supported by fog and cloud computing devices and data centers to provide a wide range of complex authenticated service and data availability. Particular attention is paid to comparing data delivery success rates and message exchange in the proposed solution against traditional UAV-supported cellular networks. Challenges and future research are also discussed with highlights on emerging technologies such as federated learning."
9312185,Analysis of Two-Step Random Access Procedure for Cellular Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications,"Due to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoTs), it can be expected that the bandwidth provided by cellular systems might be consumed up soon. Some applications of them are delay-sensitive such that it would be critical to guarantee random access (RA) delay less than a threshold. Since the existing Long-Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) RA procedure is a four-step signaling procedure, it may not be suitable for such delay-sensitive applications due to its time-consuming procedure. This work investigates a two-step RA procedure for 5G New Radio systems, where RA preamble and bandwidth request message are transmitted at the same time. First we show that the operating region of two-step RA procedure can be divided into three regions such as unsaturated stable, bistable, and saturated regions in terms of a packet generation probability, retransmission probability, the number of devices, and the number of RA preambles. To see whether RA delay requirement of delay-sensitive applications can be guaranteed, this work shows that the system should run under unsaturated region and derives RA delay distribution when IoT devices employ geometric probability backoff (GPB) or uniform window backoff (UWB) algorithm. We then examine the probability that the RA delay would be larger than some threshold depending on the operation regions."

8949670,Mobility Support Challenges for the Integration of 5G and IoT in Named Data Networking,"Named Data Networking is a consumer-driven network that supports content consumer mobility due to the nature of in-network catching. Consumer mobility was inherently supported in NDN while producer mobility was not supported, also faces many challenges from initial architectural design. Therefore, there is needs to provide substantial producer mobility support to minimize the handoff latency, handoff signaling overhead cost, reduce the unnecessary Interest packets loss to improve data packets delivery once a content producer relocated. In this paper, the Broadcasting Approach is proposed as a solution to the problem of the mobile producer in NDN. Consequently, the result may solve the inherited problems of triangular routing in NDN network mobility.

The compact, ultra-thin planar structure is bent both along its longitudinal and transversal directions. Bending the structure along the short edge (transversal direction), provides very similar performance to the flat structure. On the other hand, when the structure is bent along the long edge, the resonance frequency of the antenna experiences a slight down shift and its front-to-back ratio (FTBR) decreases a little. Nevertheless, it is demonstrated that the performance is still very acceptable and the quadrupolar system works very well in its planar and both bent states."

8713653,UWB Nanocellulose Coconut Coir Fibre Inspired Antenna For 5G Applications,"This paper intended to design an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Antenna for IoT applications that operates within 5G operating frequencies. One of the IoT-based devices architecture is Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). WBAN allows computer device to communicate with human body signal by trading digital information such as electrical conductivity. 5G is the state-of-the-art generation mobile communication. A higher data speed it offers will improve data communication efficiency in WBAN system. Two biggest challenge foreseen for the wearable UWB antenna are the physical flexibility and the antenna bandwidth. Since it is a wearable device, the selection of the material is crucial in order to ensure high flexibility and mechanical robustness. The next challenge is to warrant a wideband performance throughout the operating frequency and a trade-off with a high-dielectric in proposed substrate is essential. This paper presents a design and parametric analysis of an antenna using Nanocellulose Fiber Coir substrate with wider bandwidth as compared to 5G frequencies, 10.125 to 10.225 GHz. This paper also exhibits bandwidth improvement with the presence of artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) as a metasurface. A typical UWB patch antenna was initially designed before being integrated with AMC through a parametric sweep analysis. This paper analyzes the frequency, gain, directivity, antenna efficiency before and after optimization. This paper successfully demonstrates a Y-shaped antenna design with coplanar waveguide (CPW) using a thin film Nanocellulose Coconut Fibre Coir as a substrate and the bandwidth improvement by 16.12% with the AMC as a metasurface."
9562181,A Concurrent Training Method of Deep-Learning Autoencoders in a Multi-user Interference Channel,"Autoencoder (AE) has been proposed recently as a promising, and potentially disruptive approach to design the physical layer (PHY) of future beyond-5G networks. In this paper, we propose a novel concurrent and interactive training method for autoencoder-based physical layer for the multiuser interference channel scenario, which is highly relevant to beyond-5G dense systems. In our approach, AEs use a concurrent training approach in order to minimise the interference in the presence of other AEs. Deep learning-based AE design for a multi-user interference channel is proposed in a dense urban environment where the AE is adapted to the interference from nearby intelligent base stations (BSs) by considering other BSs randomly distributed over 200 meters. Interference is modelled based on a 3GPP channel model in an urban microcell environment. We simulate and test the system, and compare the performance with a conventional QPSK modulation in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Results show that at low signal-to-noise ratios, the AE in an interference channel delivers similar performance to that of QPSK in a noisy channel. However, at high signal-to-noise ratios, every trained AE outperforms the theoretical limit for QPSK systems in a noisy channel, in an interference-limited environment. The learned constellations is studied. We show that AEs can augment their own transmitted symbols based on the interference from nearby BSs via a learning process, which can counteract the effects of channel noise."

Vehicles communicate with each other through wireless networks. However, the deployment of new generation of mobile networks 5G needs a major upgradation of its existing systems such as 4G, LTE and other infrastructure. Therefore, it is proposed to introduce advanced technology of 5G networks upgradation in Vehicle to Vehicle communication.

Network slicing is identified as a key enabling technology to enable 5G networks with multi-services. Network slicing allows a transition from a network-as-an-infrastructure setup to a network-as-a-service to enable numerous 5G smart services with diverse requirements. Although several surveys and tutorials have discussed network slicing in detail, there is no comprehensive study discussing the taxonomy and requirements of network slicing. In this paper, we present and investigate key recent advances of network slicing towards enabling several Internet of Things (IoT) smart applications. A taxonomy is devised for network slicing using different parameters: key design principles, enablers, slicing resources levels, service function chaining schemes, physical infrastructures, and security. Furthermore, we discuss key requirements for network slicing to enable smart services. Finally, we present several open research challenges along with possible guidelines for network slicing."
8766786,An Intelligent Deterministic D2D Communication in Narrow-band Internet of Things,"To enable the internet of things (IoT) devices with increased coverage and optimized power consumption, the 3 rd generation partnership (3GPP) standardizes the idea of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) technology in the fifth generation (5G) of cellular communication. Re-transmission of control and data packets due to a poor link between user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS), is considered as one of the key feature in NB-IoT to ensure the data delivery of delay-sensitive applications, e.g. ambulance services and body sensor networks (BSN). This phenomenon degrades the energy efficiency of the already resource constrained systems. One key solution for NB-IoT UE is to exploit the device-to-device (D2D) communication using two hops instead of transmitting on a direct uplink, due to which the system performance increases. In an attempt to transmit the NB-IoT UE uplink data packet, splendid researchers have focused towards developing a D2D communication based strategy, which typically optimizes the expected packet delivery ratio (EDR) and end-to-end delay (EED) through an opportunistic method. However, such methodology imposes an additional delay due to the unavailability of active relaying nodes and increases the overall energy consumption of the system. This necessitates us to design an intelligent deterministic D2D (2D2D) relay selection strategy for delay sensitive NB-IoT UEs. The EDR and EED have been improved using deterministic programming based algorithm. Simulations with various parameters are carried out, and results are presented. Simulation results show that the deterministic algorithm gives better performance with a 10% increase in EDR and overcomes the additional delay."

It is a brain disorder caused by sudden and unprovoked seizures as a result of excitation of a lot of brain cells simultaneously which may lead to physical symptoms abnormalities and deformation such as failure in concentration, memory, attention etc. therefore, proper and efficient method of continues monitoring and detection of these epileptic seizures is paramount. This work presents an effective and efficient technique suitable for smart, low cost, power and real time devices that can be easily integrated with recent 5G network IoT devices for mobile applications, home and health care centers for monitoring and alert the doctors and patients about its occurrence to prevent a sudden collapse and consciousness which may cause injury and death. We proposed a low computational cost features extraction method by utilizing the efficacy of time-frequency, statistical and non-linear features known as hybrid techniques. The efficiency and accuracy of these smart devices is highly depends on quality of feature extraction methods and classifier performance. Therefore, this work employed two machine learning classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) and feedforward neural network (FFNN) to detect and classify interictal (normal) and ictal (seizure) signals. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is employed to decomposes the signals into decomposition levels as sub-bands of the signals to capture the non-stationarity of the EEG signals. Mean, median, maximum, minimum etc. were calculated for each sub-band as statistical parameters, non-linear features such as sample entropy, approximate entropy and wavelet energy were also calculated. The combination of features is then fed to two classifiers for the classification.

Current IoT unlicensed band technologies, such as Sigfox and LoRa, are all at an early stage of deployment without a significant market share. In this context, the MulteFire (MF) Alliance has envisioned to adapt the cellular NB-IoT design to operate within the Sub-1 GHz unlicensed spectrum. However, the diverse regulatory requirements within this unlicensed band put a hurdle to the worldwide deployment of unlicensed band IoT technologies. To settle this challenge, MF has designed a specific framework for narrow-band (NB)-IoT systems operating on unlicensed spectrum (NB-IoT-U), which can be utilized under both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) regulatory requirements. In this paper, enhanced synchronization and physical broadcasting signals are proposed based upon the framework designed by MF with the aim to allow a more robust detection, and to fulfil the coverage targets set for this technology. Furthermore, in order to allow the system to operate as a frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) system, a novel frequency hopping pattern generator compliant with the regulatory requirements is designed, and its performance is evaluated."

If D2D link is controlled by an enhanced node base station (eNB), and thus, remains a burden on the eNB and it causes delayed latency. This paper proposes a fully autonomous power allocation method for IoT-D2D communication underlaying cellular networks using deep learning. In the proposed scheme, an IoT-D2D transmitter decides the transmit power independently from an eNB and other IoT-D2D devices. In addition, the power set can be nearly optimized by deep learning with distributed manner to achieve higher cell throughput. We present a distributed deep learning architecture in which the devices are trained as a group but operate independently.

With the millions of devices expected to connect to 5G through its massive machine-type communication use case, the strict orthogonality and synchronization requirement of cyclic-prefix orthogonal division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) will demand a very large amount of control information between devices and the core network. To overcome this challenge, we study a new air interface for NB-IoT, which utilizes a non-orthogonal multicarrier transmission scheme. The waveform considered in this work is filter-bank muilticarrier with quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC-QAM). The loss of orthogonality in FBMC-QAM results in severe levels of intrinsic interference. Iterative detection and decoding (IDD) using low density parity check (LDPC) encoding and decoding is implemented together with iterative interference cancellation (IIC) to remove the inherent interference and improve the BER rate performance. Simulation results indicate that the proposed IDD receiver can effectively improve BER performance under time-varying channels."

IoT devices are small and light, with little or no processing capability to run complicated and computationally intensive security algorithms. In their natural state, IoT devices are centralized and have a single point of failure. Therefore, when we exchange data, there is a chance of fake authenticity and phishing. Due to its decentralized nature and resilience, this study tries to eliminate data security problems utilizing the phenomenon known as the blockchain.

To mitigate the problems, they are trying to use cognitive radio for interference avoidance and use of 1 GHz link as redundant link utilizing frequency diversity switched scheme for the solution to the problem of rain attenuation. Though cranes will be remotely controlled using NB-IoT (Narrow Band Internet of Things) waveform, live camera and voice are also transmitted through 5G NR (New Radio) waveform interfaced with the same link to have some accidental remedial measures. Majority of the time 28 GHz link will be useable but beyond a threshold rain intensity, NB-IoT control and other data will be diverted through 1 GHz link. One Pilot signal using 1 KHz Tone is used for estimation of rain in the 1GHz link. Beyond threshold rain intensity, the link data will be switched and re-routed through 1 GHz link as rain impact is negligible at 1GHz, thus ensuring reliability in NB-IoT Crane control operation."

The 5G technology and fog computing can reduce the service delay. A challenging problem in fog computing is how to efficiently allocate resources to guarantee the quality of service (QoS). Therefore, studying the cooperation between fog computing resources and cloud computing resources is of great significance. For resource allocation, four optimization objectives are considered: minimizing the time delay and cost and maximizing the load balancing and stability of task execution, and an improved Two_Archive2 algorithm using a novel fitness evaluation method and a shift-based density estimation strategy (SDE) is proposed. For the case of resource allocation in fog-cloud computing, the proposed algorithm shows the better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms and could serve as an effective resource allocation scheme."

Especially, this is emphasized in blockchain (BC) use cases, which typically have a wide business ecosystem and possibly disruptive business models. This paper presents two BC use case value evaluations and results. The IoT use cases were selected from two different industry segments: telecommunications-oriented 5G network slice brokering and the energy industry-related internal electricity allocation in a housing society. The use case value was assessed by applying a resource configuration framework and 4C - commerce, context, content, and connection - business model typology against BC and smart contracts characteristics and capabilities. The results derived from the data collected from the expert workshops proved the expected value of the use cases, and in general, the feasibility of BC technology for facilitating various value-creating resource configuration processes was shown. Furthermore, the resource configuration framework proved to be a valuable theoretical approach for analyzing and developing also the BC-enabled novel use cases and business models. According to the findings, further development of the framework is proposed with an introduced novel decentralized resource configuration prototype that can replace predominant platform-based business models."
9623079,Using CNN to Optimize Traffic Classification for Smart Homes in 5G Era,"With the rapid development and progress of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, more and more businesses have combined housing with emerging technologies to create smart homes to improve residents' quality of life. Many services similar to the three major application scenarios of 5G will be applied to different smart devices in future smart homes. Therefore, the overall network traffic of smart homes will inevitably increase substantially, making network traffic management in smart homes an issue worthy of in-depth discussion. However, due to the widespread use of network encryption, it is not easy to obtain information from most network application services by decrypting the traffic. It is also difficult to classify various service flows through traditional network traffic classification methods into distinct application categories for management. This research assumes that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have to manage tens of thousands of smart homes equipped with various kinds of IoT devices. We used software-defined networking (SDN) technology to simulate a multi-tenant smart home environment, simulate different types of smart home service traffic, and use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify network traffic. ISP operators can thus set the bandwidth ratio according to the classified service category to effectively improve QoS and user QoE. The experimental results show that the traffic classification accuracy of the CNN model for smart homes can reach 86.5%, which is higher than the general neural network model by 6.5%."
8906165,A GRU-Based Prediction Framework for Intelligent Resource Management at Cloud Data Centres in the Age of 5G,"The increasing deployments of 5G mobile communication system is expected to bring more processing power and storage supplements to Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices. It is foreseeable the billions of devices will be connected and it is extremely likely that these devices receive compute supplements from Clouds and upload data to the back-end datacentres for execution. Increasing number of workloads at the Cloud datacentres demand better and efficient strategies of resource management in such a way to boost the socio-economic benefits of the service providers. To this end, this paper proposes an intelligent prediction framework named IGRU-SD (Improved Gated Recurrent Unit with Stragglers Detection) based on state-of-art data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, aimed at predicting the anticipated level of resource requests over a period of time into the future. Our proposed prediction framework exploits an improved GRU neural network integrated with a resource straggler detection module to classify tasks based on their resource intensity, and further predicts the expected level of resource requests. Performance evaluations conducted on real-world Cloud trace logs demonstrate that the proposed IGRU-SD prediction framework outperforms the existing predicting models based on ARIMA, RNN and LSTM in terms of the achieved prediction accuracy."
8721102,A Heuristic Offloading Method for Deep Learning Edge Services in 5G Networks,"With the continuous development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and communications technology, especially under the epoch of 5G, mobile tasks with big scales of data have a strong demand in deep learning such as virtual speech recognition and video classification. Considering the limited computing resource and battery consumption of mobile devices (MDs), these tasks are often offloaded to the remote infrastructure, like cloud platforms, which leads to the unavoidable offloading transmission delay. Edge computing (EC) is a novel computing paradigm, capable of offloading the computation tasks to the edge of networks, which reduces the transmission delay between the MDs and cloud. Therefore, combining deep learning and EC is expected to be a solution for these tasks. However, how to decide the offloading destination [cloud or deep learning-enabled edge computing nodes (ECNs)] for computation offloading is still a challenge. In this paper, a heuristic offloading method, named HOM, is proposed to minimize the total transmission delay. To be more specific, an offloading framework for deep learning edge services is built upon centralized unit (CU)-distributed unit (DU) architecture. Then, we acquire the appropriate offloading strategy by the origin-destination ECN distance estimation and heuristic searching of the destination virtual machines for accommodating the offloaded computation tasks. Finally, the effectiveness of the scheme is verified by detailed experimental evaluations."
9026762,An Adaptive EDCA Selfishness-Aware Scheme for Dense WLANs in 5G Networks,"To keep pace with the current rapid evolution of mobile data requirements, IEEE 802.11 was evolved to provide more desirable performance to fulfill the needs of fifth-generation (5G) and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. It provides two different access contention-based schemes; Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) which not differentiates between different services, and Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) which provides differentiation between various services through four priority Access Categories (ACs). The dilemma of the conventional IEEE 802.11 networks is the static assignation of parameters in DCF and EDCA regardless of the number of associated stations and no matter what kind of service is required by each station (i.e., the activity of ACs). Consequently, this led to a significant degradation in the performance of the network, especially in the case of ultra-dense load network. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for EDCA considering a dynamic assignation of Arbitration Inter-Frame Space Number (AIFSN) and guidance Contention Window (CW) depending on the number of associated stations and ACs activeness status. Based on the analytical models of EDCA, a game-theoretic method is proposed to make each associated station adapts its transmission probability within the guidance CW. The purpose of guidance CW is a pre-stage to detect the selfish stations which pick up a very low CW to maximize its throughput regardless of the overall network throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed game-based algorithm can obtain higher performance than the standard 802.11 networks in terms of normalized throughput, data dropped during retransmissions limit threshold exceeding, and mean average delay for sensitive delay applications."
9385747,Performance Analysis of URLL Random-Access NOMA-Enabled IoT Networks with Short Packet and Diversity Transmissions,"Recently, non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) has been proposed to improve spectrum-efficiency and throughput of 5G cellular networks, and is also considered a key-enabler for ultra-reliable and low-latency (URLL) communications. Moreover, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm has emerged to provide massive-connectivity for intelligent devices and systems, which entail spectrum-efficient transmission schemes. Hence, exploiting NOMA for URLL transmissions in IoT networks is inevitable. Furthermore, random-access (RA) techniques are also considered essential to enable massive URLL IoT networks, since they reduce signaling overhead and packet latency, especially when massive numbers of clustered IoT devices with sporadic traffic behaviour are considered. In this paper, the performance of uplink RA-NOMA in URLL IoT networks with short packet and diversity transmissions is analyzed. Specifically, network metrics-such as average packet latency, reliability, and GoodPut-are mathematically derived. Additionally, the effect of transmission diversity, and number of data bits per blocklength on the different network metrics has been extensively evaluated, illustrating several tradeoffs between the different network metrics as well as highlighting the importance of carefully selecting the network parameters to satisfy the URLL requirements."

9031550,Toward the Standardization of Grant-Free Operation and the Associated NOMA Strategies in 3GPP,"The dramatic increase in Internet traffic to and from wireless devices poses significant challenges for network operators. While the current growth of traffic is mostly due to consumers communicating more frequently and larger amounts of data over the wireless infrastructure, much of the future growth is predicted to originate from non-human-operated devices or so-called IoT communication. The 3GPP standardization activities toward 5G cellular systems envisages two IoT-centric scenarios: mMTC and URLLC. In this article, we quantify the advantages of grant-free operation for 5G mMTC using latency, signaling overhead, and power consumption aspects. We propose the high-level design of a new grant-free state of operation and explain its interaction with the legacy LTE operating states. We also describe promising grantfree NOMA solutions with respect to synchronization and HARQ, and resource collision handling procedures. Our discussion and proposal relate closely to the current 5G standardization activities in 3GPP and highlight solutions that can easily be integrated into the current LTE framework."
8941132,Green Fog Planning for Optimal Internet-of-Thing Task Scheduling,"The incoming 5G technology is expected to proliferate tremendous internet-of-thing (IoT) services with real-time and mobility requirements, which are quite different from the legacy cloud services. Due to the centralized management relying on distant datacenters, cloud computing is short of satisfying the stringent IoT requirements, such as ultra-low latency, mobility, etc. Instead, distributed edge computing, such as fog computing has been coined as a promising approach and has received enormous attention in recent years. In this paper, to optimally provision the huge volume of IoT services with significant diversity, we propose to efficiently organize the leisure network devices in the network edge to form fog networks (fogs), which are then integrated with the cloud to provide storage and computing resources. Specifically, we propose two Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models to solve the fog planning issue under the integrated Cloud-Fog (iCloudFog) framework. In the first ILP model, the objective is to minimize the CAPEX cost caused by planning fogs and the OPEX cost caused by utilizing the planned fogs. In the second ILP model, the objective is to minimize the power consumption while maximizing the number of successfully provisioned IoT tasks on the planned fogs. The proposed ILP models are numerically evaluated by considering different IoT task requirements, such as real-time and mobility. The numerical results show that efficiently planned fogs can help to reduce the planning overhead while satisfying diverse IoT task requirements."

However, most of the existing works on physical layer secret key generation (PLKG) only focus on the pairwise key generation between two users, which is low-efficient and high-cost to be extended to the scenarios of group key generation. In this work, we propose a new efficient MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) physical layer group secret key generation scheme to reduce the consumption of channel probing and improve the efficiency for group key generation. Different from current schemes, in the proposed scheme, the transmitter randomly generates the group secret key, and directly broadcasts the downlink data symbols to the group users. At the receiver end, each group user can efficiently “observe"" the common group key through the downlink broadcasting data symbols, while keeping perfect secrecy of the shared group key against eavesdroppers. The performance of reliability, security and the group key generation rate are fully investigated, which shows the advantages of high efficiency, low consumption and strong robust of the proposed scheme. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

However, the mobile IoT communication networks face serious challenges, which are caused by the complex and variable communication environments. The mobile IoT applications can produce large-scale data, which will consume substantial energy. The transmit antenna selection (TAS) and cooperative communication schemes are commonly used to reduce the complexity and the energy consumption, which directly impact the performance of mobile IoT networks. To evaluate the performance of mobile IoT networks, it is important to analyze outage probability (OP) performance. In this article, we investigate the OP performance analysis of mobile IoT communication networks and propose an OP intelligent prediction algorithm based on an improved convolutional neural network (CNN). First, the mobile OP performance is analyzed by combining the TAS and decode-and-forward cooperative schemes, and the exact OP expressions are derived. Then, an improved CNN is designed to avoid the loss of important information, which contains the input layer, three-convolution layer, one fully connected layer, and output layer. The proposed CNN-based prediction approach is compared with the radial basis function (RBF), generalized regression (GR), Elman, and extreme learning machine (ELM) methods. The simulation results validate that the proposed CNN prediction approach can achieve a better prediction effect than RBF, Elman, GR, and ELM methods.

The F-RAN approach emphasises bringing the computation capability to the edge of the network so as to reduce network bottlenecks and improve latency. However, despite the potential, the management of computational resources remains a challenge in F-RAN architectures. Thus, this paper aims to overcome the shortcomings of conventional approaches to computational resource allocation in F-RANs. Reinforcement learning (RL) is presented as a method for dynamic and autonomous resource allocation, and an algorithm is proposed based on Q-learning. RL has several benefits in resource allocation problems and simulations carried out show that it outperforms reactive methods.

Nowadays, initial generations of connected IoT devices and applications enabled by Cellular-IoT (CIoT) and Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) technologies are deliberately kept simple and based on equidistant, regular communication intervals. However, this simple communication behavior does not meet 5G requirements of massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) regarding high node density, long-term energy efficiency and low cost per data. In contrast, this paper presents an approach for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based model-predictive communication to reduce the effort for continuous, regular data exchange-patterns. Training and test data for the generation of the underlying model are obtained from long-term environment sensor measurements. The derived model approaches are applied to an integrated Industrial-IoT field demonstrator covering a centralized heating control system and decentralized LoRa temperature sensors. Finally, results constitute that overall communication effort per day can be reduced by 60% to more than 95% depending on the required accuracy, significantly contributing to the achievement of mMTC performance targets."
9408706,Enabling Blind Area Coverage for the Smart Grids: Integrating Energy-efficient LoRa Technologies in the 5G,"The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G will open a range of innovations for the deployment of enhanced sensing and novel applications, controlling and interactive systems. The current smart grid (SG) will be more reliable, secure, flexible and durable by implementing 5GIoT monitoring. However, 5GIoT, is inefficiently and costly to travel over large areas and penetrate physical structures. As a complement, the proposed 5G1oRa converged network can offer a low-cost and large scale of coverage without blind areas. There are notable concerns regarding certain energy conservation issues to be overcome in order to achieve a successful integration of multi-hop LoRa systems within 5G architectures. Based on the Charnes-Cooper transform and Lagrange Multiplier iteration algorithm, a non-convex relaxation optimization is proposed to allocate transmit power for multi-hop LoRa to further maximize the system energy efficiency. The solution has been deployed, implemented and validated in a real and integrated 5GLoRa testbed, showing its feasibility to meet the requirements of SG data collection, transmission, cloud storage, and calculation in a wide area. Simulation results also validate the efficiency of our proposed model, which significantly outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of energy efficiency and QoS requirements."

Control plane congestion becomes particularly serious when accommodating massive M2M/IoT terminals into cellular networks. Although various methods have been proposed for accommodation of M2M/IoT terminals, most of them are mainly based on mathematical analysis and simulation experiments. In this paper, we show the experimental evaluation results of the performance of a mobile core network to assess the impact of bursty access from M2M/IoT terminals. First, we constructed our experimental environment based on open-source implementation of mobile core networks and emulated user terminals. Then, we conducted experiments on simultaneous attach requests from multiple user terminals and measured the processing delay at each mobile core node. The results of our evaluations proved that concentrating attach requests from forty user terminals increases the processing time at a mobility management entity (MME) by up to around 510% when an MME node is operated on a virtual machine with 1 GHz / 1 core CPU."

Wireless sensor networks are an important part of modern heterogeneous 5G mobile systems and IoT networks. The architecture, principles of organization of wireless sensor networks and their connectivity are investigated in the paper. The peculiarity of networks with mobile nodes is the alteration of conditions of radio signals propagation, which leads to random structures of such networks. Connectivity in networks with mobile nodes is their paramount characteristic and it is necessary for the functioning of the network.

8761476,Automatic Repeat Spectrum Sensing for 5G IoT Communications with Unstable Channel Conditions,"Spectrum sensing is an important tool to resolve coexistence issue and optimize spectrum efficiency for Internet of things (IoT) systems. Nonetheless, IoT applications in fifth generation (5G) communications involve complicated scenarios with unstable channel conditions, which impedes spectrum sensing performance and will further hinder the spectrum efficiency of entire IoT systems. Motivated by such a circumstance, this paper proposes an Automatic Repeat Sensing (ARS) mechanism. The proposed mechanism exploits the difference degree of sensing results among multiple sensing antennas, and executes repeat-sensing if such a degree satisfies the given requirement. Accordingly, the negative impact of unstable channel conditions can be alleviated. Throughout the paper, we provide the concept and working principle for ARS, and derive the false-alarm probability under ARS mechanism. Numerical results manifest that ARS mechanism can markedly improve the sensing accuracy over other sensing mechanisms. Moreover, ARS mechanism has excellent flexibility and extensibility: its rules and configurations can be freely designed according to practical requirements."

An experimental assessment of NOMA-CAP modulation is performed for future fronthauling in beyond 5G scenarios with IM-DD systems for a cost-effective implementation. Two transmitters are compared: an intensity modulated VCSEL as cheapest implementation; versus a tuneable laser source externally modulated by a MZM as reference of best quality. In addition, the sensitivity at 7% overhead FEC limit for two alternative receivers are analysed for a data rate of 14Gbps over 50km of SSMF in 4GHz electrical bandwidth, providing values of -13dBm (PIN) and -25dBm (APD).

While IoT-enabled many applications and services, several limitations arise in operating IoT deployments in a resilient manner over time; challenges include the energy cost and constraints. In our research, we aim to handle energy challenges caused by perpetual operations in each level of the system architecture (device, communication, and processing). We use a semantic approach that utilizes context of extracted activities of daily living (ADLs) and indoor space-state (normal, anomaly, and emergency) to drive energy optimized sensor activations. In addition, we are uniquely leveraging features such as: heterogeneity of IoT devices (wearable, ambient, and vision) in terms of: energy cost, energy source (battery-operated and wall-powered IoT devices), processing capability, mobility, communication technologies and transmission protocol (NB-IoT, LTE-M, LoRa, Wi-Fi, 4G/5G, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.), processing location (device, edge, could). To validate our approach, we developed an elderly fall detection system using multi-personal and in-situ sensing IoT devices derived from real-world deployments; using our measurements to drive larger simulations. We show that our proposed algorithms such as, Cost-Function-Gradient can achieve greater than 4X reductions in energy dissipation and doubling system-lifetime without loss of sensing accuracy."

It analyzes the problem by considering the imperfect clock synchronization of the radio units and the packet delay variation that fronthaul packets are subject to. Following the analysis, this paper proposes an implementation architecture for distributed RF transmission timing alignment based on synchronized triggering among radio units and centralized processing units. Throughout this discussion, special attention is given to the scheme's impact on the overall achievable fronthaul latency.

9438874,Modeling of IIoT Traffic Processing by Intra-Chip NoC Routers of 5G/6G Networks,"The concept of 5G/6G networks is widely used to design networks of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices. The characteristics of IIoT traffic can differ significantly from the characteristics of voice traffic, so models are required to analyze IIoT traffic. In this paper, we examined the features of IIoT traffic: the Gaussian model of WSN networks, ON/OFF, which is used for target tracking sensors, models with heavy tails (Pareto, Weibull, lognormal distribution, etc.), self-similar (fractal) models - based on normalized Fractal Brownian Motion (fBM) and Fractal Gaussian Noise (fGN), as well as the IIoT traffic model. The models are obtained empirically and approximated by known models of probability distributions. We investigated an exponential distribution IIoT traffic model. In addition, we considered the prospects of using switch fabric of NoC technology and came to the conclusion that decentralization of the process of establishing connections in switch fabric has significant advantages: it allows you to flexibly distribute incoming traffic; perform distributed arbitration; flexibly scale the communication system, with a large traffic flow from one of the system inputs, to split it by assigning many different routes for its transmission; improves system reliability by allowing reconfiguration of the switch fabric. We model the processing of traffic from such systems as OBS, 1C web systems, OWM, OSM by parallel switch fabric of NoC technology. We used the previously created simulation model of the NoC 5×5 switching system and simulated the processing of traffic having an exponential distribution with different parameter values and different packet processing times."

The massive roll out of the MTC devices is a serious challenge for cellular networks from operational and management perspective, including massive access and network congestion. Many proposals have been put forward by the research community to cater to the nuisance of massive MTC (mMTC) access in cellular networks. Recently, data aggregation has attracted a lot of research attention owing to its robust ability to resolve the above-mentioned challenges. In this paper, we review the recent development in data aggregation techniques, including their application scenarios, design, and limitations.

8910339,Dynamic Request Scheduling Optimization in Mobile Edge Computing for IoT Applications,"In the era of 5G, with the increasing demands on computation and massive data traffic of the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile edge computing (MEC) and ultradense network (UDN) are considered to be two enabling and promising technologies, which result in the so-called ultradense edge computing (UDEC). Task offloading as an effective solution offers low latency and flexible computation for mobile users in the UDEC network. However, the limited computing resources at the edge clouds and the dynamic demands of mobile users make it challenging to schedule computing requests to appropriate edge clouds. To this end, we first formulate the transmitting power allocation (PA) problem for mobile users to minimize energy consumption. Using the quasiconvex technique, we address the PA problem and present a noncooperative game model based on subgradient (NCGG). Then, we model the problem of joint request offloading and resource scheduling (JRORS) as a mixed-integer nonlinear program to minimize the response delay of requests. The JRORS problem can be divided into two problems, namely, the request offloading (RO) problem and the computing resource scheduling (RS) problem. Therefore, we analyze the JRORS problem as a double decision-making problem and propose a multiple-objective optimization algorithm based on i-NSGA-II, referred to as MO-NSGA. The simulation results show that NCGG can save the transmitting energy consumption and has a good convergence property, and MO-NSGA outperforms the existing approaches in terms of response rate and can maintain a good performance in a dynamic UDEC network."
9145159,Minimizing Forking in Blockchain-Based IoT Networks,"Blockchain is a special type of data structure in which data, usually termed as transactions, is linked together using cryptographic techniques. Because of these modular features, the applications of blockchain are being investigated in myriad domains such as cybersecurity, finance, transportation, and Internet-of-things (IoT). Although the applications of blockchain in IoT networks have much potential, many research challenges need the attention of researchers from both academia and industry. One of the open research challenges is the frequent occurrence of forking events in blockchain-based IoT networks. The forking of a blockchain can not only lead to potential security attacks but also poses excessive overhead in the largescale IoT networks. To tackle this inefficiency of blockchain-based IoT networks, this paper employs deep learning to minimize forking by reducing the transmission delays. Specifically, a deep neural network is used to reduce the transmission delay by improving the transmission rate. The deep learning approach is also compared with other benchmark techniques to show the superiority of the proposed method. We anticipate that this foundational work on blockchain-based IoT networks would pave the way for researchers to upscale the study into real-world implementations."
9246553,A Survey and Future Directions on Clustering: From WSNs to IoT and Modern Networking Paradigms,"Many Internet of Things (IoT) networks are created as an overlay over traditional ad-hoc networks such as Zigbee. Moreover, IoT networks can resemble ad-hoc networks over networks that support device-to-device (D2D) communication, e.g., D2D-enabled cellular networks and WiFi-Direct. In these ad-hoc types of IoT networks, efficient topology management is a crucial requirement, and in particular in massive scale deployments. Traditionally, clustering has been recognized as a common approach for topology management in ad-hoc networks, e.g., in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Topology management in WSNs and ad-hoc IoT networks has many design commonalities as both need to transfer data to the destination hop by hop. Thus, WSN clustering techniques can presumably be applied for topology management in ad-hoc IoT networks. This requires a comprehensive study on WSN clustering techniques and investigating their applicability to ad-hoc IoT networks. In this article, we conduct a survey of this field based on the objectives for clustering, such as reducing energy consumption and load balancing, as well as the network properties relevant for efficient clustering in IoT, such as network heterogeneity and mobility. Beyond that, we investigate the advantages and challenges of clustering when IoT is integrated with modern computing and communication technologies such as Blockchain, Fog/Edge computing, and 5G. This survey provides useful insights into research on IoT clustering, allows broader understanding of its design challenges for IoT networks, and sheds light on its future applications in modern technologies integrated with IoT."
9056532,DMM-SEP: Secure and Efficient Protocol for Distributed Mobility Management Based on 5G Networks,"In the 5G era, network mobility management is recognized as a very important factor for user service availability. Especially, due to fast speed and shrinking cell coverage, frequent handover is expected than before. Hence, efficient handover procedure is essential to guarantee seamless service to users. Distributed IP Mobility Management (DMM), a major mobility management solution, is a flat architecture that achieves efficiency and fault tolerance by excluding a centralized anchor and minimizing the distance between a mobile device and its serving network. However, DMM, which has no dominant security scheme specified to itself, is excessively dependent on the security of Layer 2 and is vulnerable to various threats. Especially, the existing security schemes are still venerable to redirection attacks launched by malicious Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs) or Control Mobility Database (CMD). Motivated by this, we proposed a DMM-based handover security protocol that can support privacy and defend against redirection attacks in addition to providing essential security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, mutual authentication, and key exchange. The proposed protocol was formally verified to be correct through AVISPA and BAN logic. Moreover, the comparison analysis showed that the proposed protocol is better than the previous studies and standards."

Low-power wide-area networking (LPWAN) has attracted enormous research interests to enable large scale deployment of IoT, with the design objectives of low cost, wide coverage area, as well as low power consumption. In particular, long battery lifetime is essential since many of the IoT devices will be deployed in hard-to-access locations. Prediction of the battery lifetime depends on the accurate modelling of energy consumption. This paper presents a comprehensive power consumption model for battery lifetime estimation, which is based on User Equipment (UE) states and procedures, for two cellular IoT technologies: Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Long Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M). A measurement testbed has been setup and the proposed model has been tested and validated via extensive measurements under various traffic patterns and network scenarios, achieving the modelling inaccuracy within 5%. The measurement results show that the battery lifetime of an IoT device can reach up to 10 years as required by 3GPP, with proper configuration of the traffic profile, the coverage scenario, as well as the network configuration parameters."

The object is usually a sensor with a communication device connected to the Internet. The popularity of IoT is increasing with the advent of 5G technology. However, the threats to the system are also getting more intense. One of the serious threats to IoT systems is known as denial of service (DoS) attack, which usually target broker services on that system. Several researches have been performed to overcome this DoS attack. However, the results appear to be ineffective. It can be seen that the accuracy of the DoS detection systems are still low. This study aims to provide a solution to the above problems by proposing an Intrusion Detection System based on Artificial Intelligence (AI, AdaBoost) for IoT system. The method used in this study is supervised learning which measures the accuracy of predictions in detecting DoS on IoT network data.

The 3D mobility of UAVs can be exploited to improve node localization in IoT networks for, e.g., search and rescue or goods localization and tracking. One of the widespread IoT communication technologies is Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), which allows achieving long communication distances with low power. In this work, we present a drone-aided localization system for LoRa networks in which a UAV is used to improve the estimation of a node's location initially provided by the network. We characterize the relevant parameters of the communication system and use them to develop and test a search algorithm in a realistic simulated scenario. We then move to the full implementation of a real system in which a drone is seamlessly integrated into Swisscom's LoRa network. The drone coordinates with the network with a two-way exchange of information which results in an accurate and fully autonomous localization system. The results obtained in our field tests show a ten-fold improvement in localization precision with respect to the estimation provided by the fixed network. Up to our knowledge, this is the first time a UAV is successfully integrated in a LoRa network to improve its localization accuracy."

On the other hand, 5G networks will provide ultra-reliable and low-latency communication for the wireless integration of autonomous industrial machinery, mobile vehicles, and robots, and management systems, aimed at the real-time control and management of industrial machinery toward smart factories. In IIoT, machine learning (ML) will also play a fundamental role in handling complex tasks at industrial machinery and 5G networks management, configuration, and control. However, ML suffers from the cold-start problem and needs a large amount of highly accurate data samples for model training, which is costly and difficult to obtain in IIoT applications.

Therefore, Fog computing, or mobile edge computing, is introduced as a promising solution to the service provision in the tiered IoT infrastructure to compensate the shortage of traditional cloud-only architecture. In this cloud-to-things continuum, several cloudlet or mobile edge server entities are placed at the access network to handle the task offloading and processing problems at the network edge. This raises the resource scheduling problem in this tiered system, which is vital for the promotion of the system efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, a scheduling mechanism for the cloudlets or fog nodes are presented, which takes the mobile tasks' deadline and resources requirements at the same time while promoting the overall profit of the system. First, the problem at the cloudlet, to which IoT devices offload their tasks, is formulated as a multi-dimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. Second, based on ant colony optimization, a scheduling algorithm is presented which treat this problem as a subset selection problem. Third, to promote the performance of the system in the dynamic environments, a churn-refined algorithm is further put forward.

8913705,Smaller and With More Bars: A Relay Transceiver for IoT/5G Applications,"Computers and smartphones have become indispensable parts of human daily life. Driven by various modern applications, the demand for high-speed Internet connection is always growing. Because Internet speed strongly depends on signal strength and quality, a great deal of effort has been spent to increase the number of ""bars"" displayed on the screen of wireless devices. One effective approach toward ""more bars"" is deploying microwave relay systems to provide stronger signals, and thus higher data rates, to end users. Microwave relay links facilitate the transmission of signals from one point to another by receiving, recovering, and retransmitting wireless signals with enhanced quality and strength. With more bars on the end-user side, handheld wireless devices also become smaller because of reduced power consumption in their receivers.

9148069,Co-operative Admission Control and Optimum Power Allocation underlying 5G-IoT Networks aided D2D-Satellite Communication,"Future mobile communication systems are expected to integrate the satellite technology to enhance the capability, reliability, and coverage area of the resilient network. Moreover, D2D communication is an effective technique that uses the same resources as allocated to cellular users and provides ultralow latency. The co-operative network optimization to maximize capacity, the number of admitted users, and allocate optimum power have not addressed from the perspective of D2D and cognitive satellite network integration for future networks. In this paper, we formulated a novel optimization problem that allocates optimum power, maximize capacity, and admitted users/IoTs by taking advantage of LEO earth orbit satellites (mega-constellation) and terrestrial-D2D mode. Besides, the algorithm defines optimum policy in mode selection, i.e., cellular, D2D, and satellite. The problem formulated is the Mix integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP), which is NP-hard. The relaxation of the formulated problem is then proposed, which guarantees convergence. Our algorithm named as the adaptive terrestrial-satellite-power sentient network (ATSPSN) is then solved by GAMS branch-cut and Non-orthogonal Mesh Adaptive (NOMAD). The results show that ATSPSN-GAMS branch-cut with D2D-satellite aided network enhances the performance in terms of capacity, admitted users, and energy efficiency without compromising on link budget cost in comparison with ATSPSN NOMAD, GAMS branch bound and conventional terrestrial network."

9525001,Near-Optimal Opportunistic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks in the 5G and IoT Era,"We consider a cognitive radio network consisting of M primary users, M primary receivers, a secondary user with K channels and K secondary receivers. A channel is assigned to each primary user for transmitting data to a primary receiver. Secondary user is assumed as data backlogged. The secondary user has no direct information on states (good or bad) of M channels, or statistic of channel evolution process. Secondary user chooses K channels for transmission in each time slot. If secondary user senses good state for a chosen channel, it can transmit data to a secondary receiver in that time slot. Otherwise, secondary user does not use that channel and choose another channel for data transmission next time. This scheduling problem is tackled under average reward criterion. Uniforming Random Ordered Policy (UROP) is proposed, and shown to achieve nearly throughput-optimality. It performs much better than myopic policy."
9565375,Analysis and Design of Analog Fountain Codes for Short Packet Communications,"In this paper, we focus on the design and analysis of the Analog Fountain Code (AFC) for short packet communications. We first propose a density evolution (DE) based framework, which tracks the evolution of the probability density function of the messages exchanged between variable and check nodes of AFC in the belief propagation decoder. Using the proposed DE framework, we formulate an optimisation problem to find the optimal AFC code parameters, including the weight-set, which minimises the bit error rate at a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our results show the superiority of our AFC code design compared to existing designs of AFC in the literature and thus the validity of the proposed DE framework in the asymptotically long block length regime. We then focus on selecting the precoder to improve the performance of AFC at short block lengths. Simulation results show that lower precode rates obtain better realised rates over a wide SNR range for short information block lengths. We also discuss the complexity of the AFC decoder and propose a threshold-based decoder to reduce the complexity."
9393199,Cryptanalysis of Resource Constraint IoT Network Authentication Protocol RAPP,"The 5 th generation mobile communication system aims to provide ultrahigh-speed internet service which is a basic requirement for the development in the field of ubiquitous computing. The Internet of Things (IoT) network is an emerging technology in the field of pervasive computing. The IoT platform refers to a network of computing devices and intelligent sensors/actuators collaborating via internet to achieve the objectives defined by the application. The security and privacy of the networks is a prime concern since confidential data is being collected by the smart sensors on a real-time basis. A secure IoT architecture performs identity verification of edge devices before providing them access to the network resources. The RFID enabled IoT networks use Ultralight weight Mutual Authentication Protocols (UMAPs) for node authentication. A UMAP ensures the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Authentication (CIAA) of the communicating parties to ensure security and privacy. In this paper confidentiality assessment of an ultralight weight protocol known as RFID Authentication Protocol using Permutation (RAPP) is performed. The structural cryptanalysis indicates that the RAPP protocol is incapable to ensuring confidentiality of information embedded in the encrypted messages."
8783990,Using Delay Tolerant Networks as a Backbone for Low-Cost Smart Cities,"Rapid urbanization burdens city infrastructure and creates the need for local governments to maximize the usage of resources to serve its citizens. Smart city projects aim to alleviate the urbanization problem by deploying a vast amount of Internet-of-things (IoT) devices to monitor and manage environmental conditions and infrastructure. However, smart city projects can be extremely expensive to deploy and manage. A significant portion of the expense is a result of providing Internet connectivity via 5G or WiFi to IoT devices. This paper proposes the use of delay tolerant networks (DTNs) as a backbone for smart city communication; enabling developing communities to become smart cities at a fraction of the cost. A model is introduced to aid policy makers in designing and evaluating the expected performance of such networks. Preliminary results are presented based on a public transit network data-set from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Finally, innovative ways of improving network performance in a low-cost smart city is discussed."
9204712,Scheduling and Decoding of Downlink Control Channel in 3GPP Narrowband-IoT,"Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a low power wide area network technology introduced by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). It is a derivative of the existing 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) that will enable cellular service to a massive number of IoT devices. In comparison with LTE and 5G New Radio, the NB-IoT devices will be of low cost, low throughput, and delay-tolerant. The reduction in available bandwidth and introduction of repetitions for achieving wider coverage requires modified Narrowband Physical Downlink Control Channel (NPDCCH) search space design and decoding as compared to the LTE. Hence, in this paper, we first explain the NPDCCH physical layer procedures, along with the search space decoding. Unlike LTE, there is no channel feedback mechanism in NB-IoT. Therefore, we propose a novel resource mapping scheme for NPDCCH based on the uplink reference signals. We perform system-level simulations and analyze the impact of the proposed mapping for varying operating frequencies and channel conditions. Further, the NB-IoT devices have limitations on the battery power, and hence, the existing control channel schedulers cannot be reused for the NB-IoT scenario. Thus, we propose a novel scheduler for NPDCCH. We have also modified the current state-of-the-art algorithms to meet the NPDCCH constraints and compared them against the proposed scheduler. We derive bounds for such scheduling algorithms and show that the proposed scheduler additionally conserves up to 25% of the IoT device battery power. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed scheduler better achieves the various trade-offs between power consumption, search space utilization, and fairness as compared to the existing schedulers."

The increasing complexity of intelligent devices in IoT brings huge challenges to the network intrusion detection. We address these issues and propose a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) called ERID, which is based on a real-time anomaly detection approach. A new type of unsupervised stacked auto-encoders (SAE), is trained by using normal network traffics, then is assessed on its ability to detect four types of attack in IoT. In this work, we mainly focus on the classification of normal and threat patterns. The extensive experimental results based on a famous real-world dataset have been conducted, which also demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our novel ERID scheme compared with the existing works in the literature. We hope our work can be used to further stimulate real-time intrusion detection approaches for IoT."
8637032,Reliable State Estimation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Over a Distributed Wireless IoT Network,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted a lot of attention due to their enormous potentiality in civil and military applications over the past years. In order to allow accurate control action of UAV, a robust and real-time state estimation technique is required. In this paper, we propose a Kalman filter based UAV state estimation technique when the communication takes place over wireless links in an Internet of Things (IoT) network. We consider that a set of sensors observes the state of the UAV and transmits the observation to a control center (central server) over a distributed wireless IoT network. To deal with the communication impairments due to wireless communication links between the UAV's sensors and the IoT system components, e.g., IoT gateways, a Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem coded communication system is presented. Based on the received signals at the IoT gateways, a global state estimation technique is proposed. Performance of the proposed communication and estimation scheme is demonstrated through numerical results for different conditions. From the comparison with a conventional estimation scheme, it is observed that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional scheme in terms of state estimation and error performance."
9217179,A Simulation Study on the Impact of IoT Traffic in a Smart-city LTE Network,"The massive introduction of traffic from the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in smart-city scenarios, needs to be supported by a steady, pervasive and reliable communication infrastructure. Cellular networks, such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 5G, are considered a popular solution to support the increasing amount of traffic from IoT, especially in smart cities. However, a massive deployment of IoT devices in existing cellular infrastructures can jeopardize the communication of human users and the overall network performance. In this study, the coexistence of IoT traffic and human users in a smart-city LTE infrastructure was studied through simulation using the SimuLTE software. Real geographical data were employed on the position of LTE base stations and IoT devices, retrieved from publicly available sources. Key network indicators, such as user throughput and cell utilization, were adopted to analyze both network and user performance. Simulation results showed a considerable performance degradation when IoT traffic is introduced into the network."
8975772,Real-Time Resource Slicing for 5G RAN via Deep Reinforcement Learning,"With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT), network slicing is regarded as an important technology to support the multi-users' needs for 5G mobile network. Network slicing allows network operators to provide services to different users, which can improve the rational utilization of network and hardware resources. In order to ensure the quality of service and build low-cost network infrastructure services, it is a challenging problem to find an appropriate resource allocation mechanism. In this paper, we discuss resource allocation in 5G radio access network (RAN). Considering the real-time resource request of the slice user, we propose a semi-Markov decision system model, which enables the virtual network provider to effectively satisfy the different user demands in real time. Then, we propose a resource slicing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (RS-DRL), which aims to improve the long-term benefits of virtual network providers and the utilization of slicing resources. We evaluate the performance of the RS-DRL through evaluations and comparisons. The results show that the proposed RS-DRL algorithm can effectively improve the performance and achieve the long-term benefits quickly."
8915702,A Blockchain-SDN-Enabled Internet of Vehicles Environment for Fog Computing and 5G Networks,"The goal of intelligent transport systems (ITSs) is to enhance the network performance of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Even though it presents new opportunities to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, there are some security concerns including the need to establish trust among the connected peers. The fifth-generation (5G) communication system, which provides reliable and low-latency communication services, is seen as the technology to cater for the challenges in VANETs. The incorporation of software-defined networks (SDNs) also ensures an effective network management. However, there should be monitoring and reporting services provided in the IoV. Blockchain, which has decentralization, transparency, and immutability as some of its properties, is designed to ensure trust in networking platforms. In that regard, this article analyzes the combination of blockchain and SDN for the effective operation of the VANET systems in 5G and fog computing paradigms. With managerial responsibilities shared between the blockchain and the SDN, it helps to relieve the pressure off the controller due to the ubiquitous processing that occurs. A trust-based model that curbs malicious activities in the network is also presented. The simulation results substantially guarantee an efficient network performance, while also ensuring that there is trust among the entities."

9295652,ICAQ: Adaptive QoS System for 5G and Beyond Applications,"Management of network becomes increasingly difficult due to the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and heterogeneous demands of applications. To mitigate congestion and maintain a high quality of service (QoS) for application users, we propose an importance-oriented clustering-based QoS system named ICAQ. The system uses unsupervised machine learning to determine and differentiate different application flow priority. The system is proposed to be a generic to both network core features and the application features. An environment monitoring IoT application is implemented as an example to demonstrate the expressive power of ICAQ. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of ICAQ and show a promising potential for using ICAQ for the QoS management of IoT applications in 5G and beyond networks."
9212417,Data-Driven Trajectory Quality Improvement for Promoting Intelligent Vessel Traffic Services in 6G-Enabled Maritime IoT Systems,"Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.

9165797,Service-Oriented Energy-Latency Tradeoff for IoT Task Partial Offloading in MEC-Enhanced Multi-RAT Networks,"The development of the 5G network is envisioned to offer various types of services like virtual reality/augmented reality and autonomous vehicles applications with low-latency requirements in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has become a promising solution for enhancing the computation capacity of mobile devices at the edge of the network in a 5G wireless network. Additionally, multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs) have been verified with the potential in lowering the transmission latency and energy consumption, while improving the Quality of Services (QoS). Benefiting from the cooperation of multi-RATs, large latency-sensitive computing service tasks (L2SC) can be offloaded by different RATs simultaneously, which has great practical significance for data partitioned oriented applications with large task sizes. In this article, to enhance the L2SC offloading services for satisfying low-latency requirements with low energy consumption, we investigate the energy-latency tradeoff problem for partial task offloading in the MEC-enhanced multi-RAT network, considering the limitation of energy and computing in capability-constrained end devices in IoT networks. Specifically, we formulated the L2SC task computation offloading problem to minimize the weighted sum of the latency cost and the energy consumption by jointly optimizing the local computing frequency, task splitting, and transmit power, while guaranteeing the stringent latency requirement and the residual energy constraint. Due to the nonsmoothness and nonconvexity of the formulated problem with high complexity, we convert the tradeoff problem into a smooth biconvex problem and propose an alternate convex search-based algorithm, which can greatly reduce the computational complexity. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with various performance parameters."
8766654,A Deep Reinforcement Learning based Mechanism for Cell Outage Compensation in Massive IoT Environments,"As one of the key technologies of 5G, massive IoT environments provide the ubiquitous IoT services. Compared with 4G, its structure is more complex, and it has a large number of deployed nodes. If a failure occurs and can't be alleviated its effect in time, it will lead to a significant drop in network performance. Therefore, the cell outage compensation (COC) problem in massive IoT environments is very important. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been applied to many scenarios related to the self-organizing network (SON), there are fewer applications for cell outage compensation. In this paper, aiming at the cell outage scenario in massive IoT environments with the goal of maximizing the connectivity of base stations while meeting service quality demands of each compensation user, we present a framework based on DRL to solve it. Specifically, we first allocate compensation users to adjacent BSs by using the K-means clustering algorithm, then use DQN to find the antenna downtilt and the power allocated to compensation users. The simulation result shows that the algorithm converges quickly and tends to be stable, and reach 95% of the maximum target value. It verifies the efficiency of the DRL-based framework and its effectiveness in meeting user requirements and handling cell outage compensation."
9309458,Interference and Spatial Throughput Characterization through Practical 3D Mapping in Dense Indoor IoT Scenarios,"Ultra-dense Internet of Things (IoT) networks in the unlicensed bands are subject to significant interference due to their high deployment density and attacks from malicious users. The interference has a non-uniform distribution, when examined in 3D space which leads to the need of volumetric monitoring for precise estimation of spectrum utilization. This paper analyzes the indoor spectrum occupancy for two promising IoT standards - LoRa and WiFi, through 3D interference maps and spatial throughput (ST) analysis produced using an automated measurement tool. The system is implemented through software-defined radio (SDR) platforms. Fading impacts the interference distribution not only in a single plane but also in height. In addition, the experimental results show that the received interference power within an area (measured in m 2 ) and a volume (in m 3 ), and consequently the ST, vary dynamically. Thus, the worst-case interference rather the mean value, needs to be considered in realistic dense scenarios for beyond 5G IoT networks."
9144704,Internet of Reliable Things: Toward D2D-enabled NB-IoT,"A growing number of connected IoT devices makes it more and more difficult for the network to provide the desired reliability in any deployment scenario. The advent of NB-IoT technology opens new possibilities for low-power long-range IoT applications. However, the design of the standard introduces high battery drainage in the situations when the radio conditions between the UE and the eNB are poor. Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is considered a promising technology to address this problem, since D2D makes it possible for the end-devices to exchange the data without the assistance of the base stations. In this work, we study how NB-IoT applications in general can benefit from enabling D2D communication. We focus on assuring reliability and QoS parametres for critical Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches, identify the realisation challenges and highlight the future research directions."

A comprehensive structure comprising of stochastic models, a responsive mechanism and typical scenarios using pedestrian-to-infrastructure (P2I) and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication is suggested to increase pedestrian safety. Nonetheless, it is uncertain what’s the optimum way to transfer data from Vehicle/Infrastructure to pedestrians and vice versa. In this article we are presenting a prototype for P21 and I2P with the help of Pedestrian detection algorithm by using a Nordic-semiconductor thingy-sensor and an android phone (Note 5A). For motion detection of pedestrian, we developed a peak detection algorithm with LPF for jitter/interference removal. It indicates promising results for walking pedestrian with almost 99% accuracy. We will use that motion detection GPS coordinates of a pedestrian (Demo user) and vehicles and transmit those coordinates to Road Weather Station (RWS) or IOT cloud via cellular base station. Finnish Meteorological Institutes (FMI) uses a test track (1.7 Km) in Sodankylä, equipped with road weather stations and 5G test network. We would be able to send the warning alerts of a pedestrian to RWS database. These P2I and V2P pilot measurements would be conducted by using IEEE 802.11p and 5G test network. To evaluate the feasibility of the system; it would help to determine the use of above mentioned model and the responsive control method.

However, IoT networks are highly dynamic environments and challenges arise for developing scalable, self-organizing and self-configuring topologies. In this paper, we focus on the problem of discovering, connecting and organizing IoT devices that facilitate mechanisms to collect, aggregate, filter, process, store and retrieve data. In particular, we propose a novel peer to peer multichord-based protocol for IoT over LEO satellite networks.

In order to realize the proposed 25 GHz bandpass filter, a high performance 0.18 μm CMOS multilayer (ML) inductor and a rectangular spiral capacitor are developed and connected in a series resonating configuration with very small chip area. This BPF simulation is performed using High Frequency Structural Simulator (HFSS). This BPF simulation had demonstrated a higher quality factor (Q) of 16.67, with only very small 6% fractional bandwidth. It showed very low inband insertion loss of -0.36 dB and enhanced return loss of -23.43 dB. With this performance, it possesses a narrowband spectrum to produce good quality output signals, still occupying very small footprint at 25 GHz. It also has resulted in a minimum out band rejection of 30 dB. The onchip area occupied by this miniature filter is only 150 μm × 180 μm, excluding the port connections. Thus the proposed compact highly selective BPF will definitely satisfy the 5G radio system on chip (SOC) requirements for the mobile, navigation and other IOT networks. This filter simulation is focused around 25 GHz, because this frequency band is favored for the fast emerging 5G network applications. This miniature on-chip BPF significantly minimizes the cost and size of the chip at 5G radio frequencies in contrast with many reported BPF models."
9279384,A Game Theory Based Clustering Scheme (GCS) for 5G-based Smart Healthcare,"5G technology will play a significant role in the next-generation smart healthcare network. D2D communication, one the key enabling technology of 5G, makes use of devices in the vicinity for resources utilization, reducing latency, improving data rates and increasing system capacity. The integration of multi-hop and cellular networks not only delivers reliability and Quality of Service (QoS) but also make the network adaptable and flexible. In next-generation multi-hop cellular D2D networks, clustering and routing are presents significant challenges. Therefore, if the clustering and routing decisions are not appropriately implemented, multi-hop network performance can be worse as compared to the traditional network. This is because clustering and routing play a significant role to manage network fragmentation and dynamic network topology, which are not present in a traditional cellular network. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme based on game theory (i.e., mixed strategy) to select optimal cluster heads (CHs) and transmit data from a cluster head (CH) to base station (BS). The simulation results show that our proposed scheme is better than LEACH protocol in terms of a network lifetime and energy consumption. We used MATLAB environment to simulate our proposed scheme and compared with LEACH protocol."
9566416,The Promising Role of 3D-printed Dielectric Resonator Antennas in the IoT Framework,"One of the most demanding frameworks is that of IoT and mobile applications. This determines a growing need for miniaturization, asking for smaller and smaller devices capable of intercommunicating with different transmission technologies like, for example, Bluetooth, WiFi, and the near-to-come 5G. To fulfill this demand, Dielectric Resonator Antennas (DRAs) can be used for their compact size, wide-band behavior, and high efficiency. However, these antennas are also expensive and difficult to produce. At this regard, Additive Manufacturing could grant improvements of different kind going from the reduction of production costs to the possibility of realizing complex shapes not achievable with a traditional manufacturing process. In this paper, a first example of a new design for a 3D-printable DRA, operating from 2.45 GHz to 3.75 GHz and realizable with a low-cost FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) 3D printer, is presented and discussed as well as the ongoing research activity on the matter, carried on at University of Salento."

9482438,PiEdge: An Edge-Driven PaaS Model for Network Slicing Automation,"A recently proposed direction that is pursued by standardization organizations for 5G Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies at the core of next-generation networks (5G and beyond) is the adoption of “Cloud-native” design principles. These principles are catalyzed by Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions that allow re-usability of common or dedicated Virtual Network Functions, in order to fulfill the diverse vertical requirements for network slices. PaaS solutions can also be extended to Multi-access Edge Computing environments (i.e. at the edge of the cellular network) to take advantage of predefined edge-based network functions and services and to decouple their lifecycle management from centralized, delay-introducing operations. Currently, core-to-edge coordination for end-to-end network slicing, from 5G Core Network to the edge, takes place at a very low abstraction level, leading to significant overheads that pose scalability and latency threats, especially crucial for mission-critical applications. To tackle this challenge, we describe a methodology for automating the interaction between the NFV MANO and edge platforms that encompass PaaS functions at the edge. The methodology offers benefits for 1) eliminating configuration, integration and management effort for end-to-end network slicing, and 2) the exposure of edge resources to the NFV MANO as usable platform services. We showcase the automation and management overhead benefits of our solution through experiments on an edge-based Internet of Things (IoT) use case, deployed at the 5G-VINNI Spanish 5G Facility site."
8778569,Recursive Cryptanalysis of the IoT Authentication Protocol,"The Internet of Things (IoT) network is an emergent stream of pervasive computing by virtue of high network speed and increased capacity offered by 5 th generation communication system.

8739278,Impact of Heavy Rain on Signal Propagation in the UK and Mexican 4G and 5G Networks,"Wireless sensor networks are a current area of interest for many researchers, however surprisingly few have actually been deployed. In this paper we present preliminary results from a series of experiments designed to assess the viability of using existing mobile phone networks in developing countries to create flood warning systems. Creation of a flood warning network involves placing wirelessly connected nodes on all significant tributaries of a river system often over several hundreds of square kilometres. Rain is one of the principal causes of signal change in mobile networks. To assess the effect of the above on associated Internet of Things (IoT) flood alert systems, measurements were conducted in the UK and Mexico to determine the attenuation of line of sight (LOS) and ground multipath propagation due to either rain or excess surface water. Both components are analysed using ray tracing simulation software in addition to the real-time field measurements with the mobile hand set `app' G-NetTrack Pro. Measurement experience gleaned from the UK campaign has been used to formulate a more comprehensive hand set based strategy in the Colima flood zone in Mexico, the results of which are also summarized in this paper. It is believed that both the above measurement and ray trace modelling exercises may be used to further optimize protocols required to address the propagation needs of future 4G/5G networks."

Moreover, the computations and storage on remote cloud servers which are typically situated far away from the end user bring in additional challenges of increased network latency and bottlenecked network bandwidths. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging technology that provides cloud and IT services including computation, networking and storage closer to the mobile subscribers.

Therefore, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted MEC is considered to address these problems. However, the computation performance is limited by the UAV hover model, which is affected by the UAV's velocity, acceleration, and a variable altitude. Nowadays, a terrestrial-satellite network (STN) plays a role in important 5G network development. The characteristics of an STN integrated with 5G are a low delay, high bandwidth, and ubiquitous coverage. Hence, 5G high-speed satellite-terrestrial assisted mobile edge computing (SMEC) is considered as a flying mobile edge computing, which will be discussed in terms of reasons, advantages, and open issues in this paper."
9432385,Improved Energy Efficiency of Massive MIMO-OFDM,"Today the world is moving towards the 5G technology in order to achieve high data rates, high throughput and low latency. To overcome the situation, this research work simulates and analyzes the 5G symbol with other conventional signals. The OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and MIMO (Multiple Input and Multiple Output) technology plays a vital role in Symbol detection. Using detectors various attributes of the signals such as signal/noise ratio, Bit Error Rate and various signal parameters are simulated and their performances are monitored using MATLAB. Here, this research work majorly focuses on the techniques of SLM (Selective Mapping) and PTS (Partial Transmit Sequence) for analyzing the signal parameters such as PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio) and SNR (Signal to Noise ratio). OFDM is used for long distance communication as it reduces the interference and noise. MIMO system has n number of transmitters at the input and receivers at the output side. The MIMO used here for symbol detection has better performance compared with other existing system. The operation of the 5G system can be extended in the areas of mobile broadband, IOT devices and in vehicles. By analyzing the signal parameters, the quality of the signal could be improved which is again an added advantage."

9569424,Rate-Splitting Random Access Mechanism for Massive Machine Type Communications in 5G Cellular Internet-of-Things,"The cellular Internet-of-Things has resulted in the deployment of millions of machine type communication (MTC) devices under the coverage of a single gNodeB (gNB). These massive number of devices should connect to the gNodeB (gNB) via the random access channel (RACH) mechanism. Moreover, the existing RACH mechanisms are inefficient when dealing with such large number of devices. To address this issue, we propose the rate-splitting random access (RSRA) mechanism, which uses rate splitting and decoding in rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), to improve the RACH success rate. The proposed mechanism divides the message into common and private messages and enhances the decoding performance. We demonstrate, using extensive simulations, that the proposed RSRA mechanism significantly improves the success rate of MTC in cellular IoT networks. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism with increasing number of devices and received power difference."

In order to facilitate the harmonic and fair coexistence in wireless heterogeneous networks, it is important to eliminate NB-IoT interference to LTE systems. In this paper, a novel sparse machine learning-based framework and a sparse combinatorial optimization problem is formulated for accurate NBI recovery, which can be efficiently solved using the proposed iterative sparse learning algorithm called sparse cross-entropy minimization (SCEM). To further improve the recovery accuracy and convergence rate, regularization is introduced to the loss function in the enhanced algorithm called regularized SCEM. Moreover, exploiting the spatial correlation of NBI, the framework is extended to multiple-input multiple-output systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods are effective in eliminating NB-IoT interference to LTE systems, and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods."
9039624,HBLP: A Hybrid Underlay-Interweave Mode CRN for the Future 5G-Based Internet of Things,"Enhancing spectrum utilization efficiency (SUE) to accommodate the multitude of 5G-based IoT devices within the available scarce spectrum has been a pivotal point of research in the current decade. Equipped with interweave and underlay modes, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are envisioned to be the most promising technology for SUE enhancement. Since the 5G-based IoT is swiftly transforming into a heterogeneous network, hybrid underlay-interweave mode CRNs appear to be the optimal key for SUE enhancement. Besides enhancing SUE, ensuring fairness among secondary users (SUs) to equitably utilize the network's resources in the wake of primary users' (PUs) service emergence has been a critical problem in CRNs. Considering the importance of SUE enhancement, in this paper, we investigate two problems. Firstly, we precisely analyze, in a novel way, the performance of hybrid underlay-interweave mode of CRNs for SUE enhancement from the standpoint of SUs. For this purpose, we propose a hybrid underlay-interweave mode enabled CRN scheme and apply it on a legacy CRN. We model the proposed scheme with continuous time Markov chain and derive closed form expressions for various SUE-related quality of service parameters. The analysis is conducted under dynamic reservation of channels for interrupted users, considering the effects of multi-levels network traffic loads and varying channel failure rates. Secondly, we propose a multi-attribute based fairness driven algorithm for determination and interruption of SUs' services to ensure fairness among services in the network's resources utilization. We evaluate our proposed scheme under both perfect and imperfect spectrum sensing scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate that, as compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed scheme significantly enhances SUE while the proposed algorithm achieves a noticeable fairness among SUs' services."

9024380,A Scheduling Framework for Latency Optimization on 5G Mobile Edge Computing Infrastructures,"Minimizing the latency in communications is assuming a paramount importance in 5G architectures, mainly for mission-critical applications associated to the IoT environment. However, the need of interacting with cloud-based applications introduces unacceptable delays essentially due to wide area transport activities over the Internet. Many solutions are emerging for facing this problem ranging from cloudlets to fog and edge computing architectures, pushing flexible virtualization environments nearer to the end devices, ideally within the base stations. Unfortunately, most of these infrastructures are managed by cloud providers in a network- oblivious way so that in presence of multiple nodes operating at the edge level in the same area no latency optimization strategies are taken into consideration. Accordingly, we present a novel latency- aware edge node selection framework based on a multi-objective bin packing problem transposed in the mobile edge computing scenario where the selection criterion is driven by both latency optimization and load balancing, managed according to a time slotted scheme."

Then, to maximize the average resource allocation performance, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) optimization method is proposed. For user resource request queue round-robin scheduling algorithm is applied to control the traffic for sharing resources. Finally, this work addresses two leading issues as allocating network slices to the users, balancing resource blocks, and quality of service for fair resource allocation."
8950122,Performance Analysis of Onshore NB-IoT for Container Tracking During Near-the-Shore Vessel Navigation,"This article aims to put forward the utilization of onshore narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) infrastructure for tracking of containers transported by marine cargo vessels while operating near the coastline. We introduce and evaluate three connectivity strategies, including direct sensor-to-onshore base station (BS) transmission as well as two relay-aided schemes using dedicated vessel-BS or unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-mounted BS as intermediate nodes. To assess and compare the proposed schemes in terms of the message loss and delay metrics as well as sensor lifetimes, we first employ stochastic geometry to characterize the connectivity process with the onshore deployment and then resort to system-level simulations. Our results indicate that the direct access option suffers from the poorest performance. The relay-based alternatives allow to dramatically improve the system operation by effectively distributing the transmission requests over time at the relay side and thus mitigating contention. Furthermore, gains enabled with UAV relaying are due to extended coverage that increases the available BS density. The considered relaying operation may help tolerate intermittent connectivity across a broad range of system parameters."

Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) schemes are required to enable wireless reliability with high transmission efficiency in IoT. To improve the throughput performance between the low-power devices, in this paper, a systematic multi-packet HARQ (SMP-HARQ) scheme using polar codes is first proposed. Then, in order to obtain maximal throughput, parameter configuration of proposed HARQ scheme is optimized with low complexity. The optimization strategy can be applied into fading channels. Finally, numerical simulation results show that the proposed SMP-HARQ could improve throughput performance compared to existing HARQ schemes for IoT applications over both the AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels, particularly in the low SNR regions."

Different sensors, video cameras, robots, and general-purpose IoT devices can be organised into groups to receive services over a Point-to-Multipoint (PTM) link, thus improving the system spectral efficiency. When the group-oriented content is available in the radio access network (RAN) segment, the network sends paging messages to announce the multicast service. However, most of the battery-powered devices are not immediately available for paging and multicast services. In this work, we analyze the fundamental trade-off between paging and delay for the group-based content delivery. The impact of different paging configurations on the system performance is investigated analytically and proved by simulations."

However, the existing flotation foam image processing systems based on wired communication brings insufficient computational resources, poor scalability and high capital expenditure. In this paper, we propose a two-stage coal flotation foam image processing system based on 5G Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and edge computing. In the first stage, i.e., task offloading stage, we exploit Lyapunov optimization to decompose the coupling between long-term constrains and short-term decisions. A matching theory-based task offloading algorithm is proposed to maximize the average network throughput. In the second stage, i.e., image processing stage, we employ gray level histogram and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to extract the texture feature parameters of the coal slime flotation foam image. On that basis, we present an ash value prediction algorithm based on multiple linear regression. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out to verify the reliability, feasibility and efficiency of the proposed task offloading algorithm and ash value prediction algorithm."

To achieve these limitations, ETSI has introduced the paradigm of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) for creating efficient data processing architecture extending the cloud computing capabilities in the Radio Access Network (RAN). Despite the gained enhancements to the mobile network, MEC is subjected to security challenges raised from the heterogeneity of IoT services, intricacies in integrating virtualization technologies, and maintaining the performance guarantees of the mobile networks (i.e. 5G).

8795319,Intrusion Detection for IoT Devices based on RF Fingerprinting using Deep Learning,"Internet of Things (IoT) and 4G/5G wireless networks have added huge number of devices and new services, where commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) IoT devices have been deployed extensively. To ensure secure operations of these systems with wireless transmission capabilities, Radio Frequency (RF) surveillance is important to monitor their activities in RF spectrum and detect unauthorized IoT devices. Specifically, in order to prevent an adversary from impersonating legitimate users using identical devices from the same manufacturer, unique “signatures” must be obtained for every individual device in order to uniquely identify each device. In this study, a novel intrusion detection method is proposed to detect unauthorized IoT devices using deep learning. The proposed method is based on RF fingerprinting since physical layer based features are device specific and more difficult to impersonate. RF traces are collected from six “identical” ZigBee devices via a USRP based test bed. The traces span a range of Signal-to-Noise Ratio, to ensure robustness of the model. A convolutional neural network is used to extract features from the RF traces, and dimension reduction and de-correlation are performed on the extracted features. The reduced features are then clustered to identify IoT devices. We show that the proposed method is able to identify devices that are not observed during training. The results not only highlight the benefit of deep learning based feature extraction, but also show promising prospects for being able to distinguish new devices (classes) that are not observed during training."

9244004,An Uplink Grant-Free Access Solution Based on Sparse Resource Pattern for IoT,"With the rapid development of the Internet of things (IoT), simultaneous access of the massive devices to the network becomes essential. The current multiple access scheme in 4G is a traditional grant-based scheme which needs permission to access the system. It will suffer from congestion and overloading as the number of device increases. Therefore, grant-free random access, where users do not need to access channel resource through four step handshake process, recently gained wide interest in 5G new radio. Moreover, non-orthogonal technology is an effective way to deal with frequent collisions in the grant-free scheme. In this paper, we propose a grant-free non-orthogonal random access (GF-NORA) scheme based on sparse on-off resource pattern. The on-off pattern enables users to occupy resource blocks continuously or discontinuously. And the sparsity of resource pattern is helpful to change the distribution of non-collision part's ratio of signals. A variety of operating modes are supported because of the flexible use of resource patterns. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively change the distribution of non-collision part's ratio of signals when adopting the single user detection. By selecting the appropriate coded-modulation scheme to recover messages from the non-collision part, the outage probability will be reduced compared with slotted ALOHA."

In this paper, inspired by the active radio access network (RAN) sharing standard of 3GPP, we present a heterogeneous multi-operator spectrum sharing architecture by leveraging the spectrum trading to support the coexistence of QoS-guaranteed cellular users and massive IoT devices with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In the architecture, we formulate the spectrum trading between the wireless spectrum provider (WSP) and mobile network operators (MNOs) as a Stackelberg pricing game. Meanwhile, for each MNO, the cellular users and massive IoT devices can be both serviced in the uplink NOMA networks with QoS guarantees. For the pricing game, we prove the uniqueness of the equilibrium solution, which can maximize the payoffs of MNOs and WSP simultaneously. Moreover, we propose an iterative pricing algorithm to achieve the equilibrium solution with theoretical optimality guarantees. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework can support more IoT devices and reach the optimal spectral bandwidth price."

It is well known that UAVs may fly over the terrestrial plane, where and when needed, acting as Unmanned Aerial Base Stations (UABs). In order to serve as many ground IoT devices as possible, a proper trajectory design is fundamental.

9096289,Privacy-Preserving and Distributed Algorithms for Modular Exponentiation in IoT With Edge Computing Assistance,"With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G, edge computing, as a new computing paradigm, has been widely popularized in academia and industry. Due to the distributed architecture and being close to the user, edge computing can faster respond to the IoT device's request and provide a better quality of service for IoT applications. An important application of edge computing is to outsource the complicated computation task to the nearby edge nodes. Modular exponentiation is widely considered as one of the most common and expensive operations in cryptographic protocols. As far as we know, all secure outsourcing algorithms of modular exponentiation are based on the centralized cloud server, but not based on multiple edge nodes. In this article, we propose the first secure and distributed outsourcing algorithm for modular exponentiation (fixed base and variable exponent) under the multiple noncolluding edge node model. In our algorithm, the exponent is divided into a certain number of parts. In addition, we propose another secure and distributed outsourcing algorithm of modular exponentiation (variable base and variable exponent). The user can protect the privacy in the process of outsourcing and detect the invalid results from edge nodes with high probability. Finally, we provide the experimental evaluation to support that our proposed algorithms are efficient on both the user side and the edge node side."
9131749,DeCoNet: Density Clustering-Based Base Station Control for Energy-Efficient Cellular IoT Networks,"Recently, there has been a rapid increase in the number of (small-cell) base stations (BSs) to support the massive amount of mobile data traffic and rapidly increasing number of mobile devices in beyond 5G (B5G) wireless communication systems or Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, many of these BSs tend to waste a considerable amount of energy to support such data traffic and mobile devices. Therefore, the development of an efficient BS status control algorithm is important for realizing energy-efficient IoT networks. To reduce network energy consumption, we herein propose a density clustering-based BS control algorithm for energy-efficient IoT networks (DeCoNet). DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) are utilized for partitioning high and low user-density regions. To find the effective number of BSs and their appropriate locations considering user-density differences, we utilize parameters obtained after applying density clustering algorithms to derive the thinning radius that is used to adjust the status of BSs in overall cellular IoT networks. Specifically, the average reachability-distance of each cluster in OPTICS and the distance between the outermost border users of each cluster in DBSCAN are used to obtain the radius of each cluster region. Through extensive computer simulations, we show that the proposed algorithms outperform the conventional algorithms in terms of average area throughput, energy efficiency, energy per information bit, and power consumption per unit area."
9077977,Hybrid Routing for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Detection in IoT Networks,"Affordable and expandable low power networks such as 5G and Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) in the public and private network areas have improved network bandwidth capacities and processing performance. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are increasing in popularity with numerous applications and devices being developed for smart environments and health-related applications. This raises security concerns in these networks, as many IoT devices handle confidential information such as IP/MAC addresses, which could be used to identify a user's location. As a result, there is vulnerability to data tampering by man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, which feature two observable characteristics: (1) there is a measurable delay in the session and (2) has unusual travel times compared to prior normal transactions. To improve the detection of these attacks, this paper proposes a novel scheme using a hybrid routing mechanism, which involves appointing dedicated nodes for enforcing routing between IoT devices and users with minimal intervention and workload to the network. The function of dedicated devices with more computational and battery power can provide three advantages: (1) determine secured paths within the network by avoiding suspicious nodes and networks, (2) provide stable travel times (less fluctuations) for a trusted time server (TTS) to improve the accuracy of estimated travel times, and (3) provide packet inspection for security checks. This proposed solution contributes towards increasing the security of IoT networks by enabling the real-time detection of intruders."
8730509,RAPID: Contention Resolution Based Random Access Using Context ID for IoT,"With the increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, machine-type communication (MTC) has become an important use case of the fifth-generation communication systems. Since MTC devices are mostly disconnected from base station for power saving, random access procedure is required for devices to transmit data. If many devices try random access simultaneously, preamble collision problem occurs, thus causing latency increase. In an environment where delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant devices coexist, the contention-based random access procedure cannot satisfy latency requirements of delay-sensitive devices. Therefore, we propose RAPID, a novel random access procedure, which is completed through two message exchanges for the delay-sensitive devices. We also develop access pattern analyzer, which estimates traffic characteristics of MTC devices. When user equipment, performing RAPID and contention-based random access, coexist, it is important to determine a value that is the number of preambles for RAPID to reduce random access load. Thus, we analyze random access load using a Markov chain model to obtain the optimal number of preambles for RAPID. Simulation results show that RAPID achieves 99.999% reliability with 80.8% shorter uplink latency, and also decreases random access load by 30.5% compared with state-of-the-art techniques."

In this article, we present a potential application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare and physical distance monitoring for pandemic situations. The proposed framework consists of three parts: a lightweight and low-cost IoT node, a smartphone application (app), and fog-based Machine Learning (ML) tools for data analysis and diagnosis. The IoT node tracks health parameters, including body temperature, cough rate, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation, then updates the smartphone app to display the user health conditions. The app notifies the user to maintain a physical distance of 2 m (or 6 ft), which is a key factor in controlling virus spread. In addition, a Fuzzy Mamdani system (running at the fog server) considers the environmental risk and user health conditions to predict the risk of spreading infection in real time. The environmental risk conveys from the virtual zone concept and provides updated information for different places.

8663449,Saturated Throughput Analysis of IEEE 802.11ad EDCA For High Data Rate 5G-IoT Applications,"The recently developed IEEE 802.11ad (WiGig) standard offers multi-Gbps connectivity for consumer wireless local area networks and operates in the millimeter wave frequency band (around 60 GHz). It supports two different contention-based channel access mechanisms, namely distributed coordination function, which offers fair service for every station, and the enhanced distributed channel Access (EDCA) for offering service differentiation among the stations. In this paper, we study the throughput performance of the IEEE 802.11ad EDCA mechanism under saturated traffic conditions using both analytical and simulation models. A novel five-dimensional Markov chain developed is used for analytically modeling the throughput behavior of the IEEE 802.11ad EDCA in the presence of virtual antenna sectors, high-gain directional beamforming, and presence of contention and contention-free access periods. Using this developed analytical model, the effect of the number of sectors, number of stations, arbitration inter-frame space, packet length, and minimum contention window size on the throughput of the four different access or service categories present in the EDCA under saturated traffic conditions, is investigated. When compared with the simulation outcomes, the proposed analytical model accurately analyzes the network performance by achieving less than 4% error."
8891144,Game Theoretical Approach of Blockchain-Based Spectrum Sharing for 5G-Enabled IoTs in Dense Networks,"The demand for frequency is continuously increasing owing to the growth of wireless communication devices and the development of network technology. To share frequency effectively in a limited frequency resource environment, studies to develop spectrum-sharing technology should be conducted. In this study, a blockchain-based spectrum- sharing system, in which various types of users can efficiently share spectrum in dense networks, is proposed. Furthermore, a method to apply game theory to obtain cooperation from users who do not participate in the spectrum-sharing system is studied. When the simulation was conducted based on game theory, the proposed blockchain-based spectrum-sharing technique was simulated by using the tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy, in which the system cooperates with the users if the users collaborate and the system does not cooperate with the users if the users do not collaborate. Simulations show that there are more than a certain percentage of users who use the TFT strategy, and if users are encouraged to change their sharing strategy on a regular basis, they can provide more efficient spectrum sharing than traditional centralized methods. It was confirmed that this technique can improve spectrum sharing by 55.1% or more through optimization."
8706532,NOMA Aided Narrowband IoT for Machine Type Communications With User Clustering,"To support machine type communications (MTCs) in next generation mobile networks, Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) has been released by the third generation partnership project (3GPP) as a promising solution to provide extended coverage and low energy consumption for low cost MTC devices. However, the existing orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme in NB-IoT cannot provide connectivity for a massive number of MTC devices. In parallel with the development of NB-IoT and non-OMA (NOMA), introduced for the fifth generation wireless networks, is deemed to significantly improve the network capacity by providing massive connectivity through sharing the same spectral resources. To leverage NOMA in the context of NB-IoT, we propose a power domain NOMA scheme with user clustering for an NB-IoT system. In particular, the MTC devices are assigned to different ranks within the NOMA clusters where they transmit over the same frequency resources. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the total throughput of the network by optimizing the resource allocation of MTC devices and NOMA clustering while satisfying the transmission power and quality of service requirements. We prove the NP-hardness of the proposed optimization problem. We further design an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem by jointly optimizing NOMA clustering and resource allocation of MTC devices. Furthermore, we prove that the reduced optimization problem of power control is a convex optimization task. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme."

The idea of integrating WPT in wireless communication leads to the idea of Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) that transfers information and power to wireless devices simultaneously, thereby resulting in a drastic increase in spectral efficiency of the network. SWIPT aided Cooperative Relaying (CoR) has emerged as a new trend for Fifth Generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) systems owing to the rapidly increasing challenges faced by these networks. Cooperative relaying combined with SWIPT can be helpful in overcoming the rising demands of next generation wireless networks by providing an enhanced data rate, low latency, shorter coverage, wide spread connectivity of massive number of devices along with energy-efficiency.

9548694,Grant-Free Coexistence of Critical and Non-Critical IoT Services in Two-Hop Satellite and Terrestrial Networks,"Terrestrial and satellite communication networks often rely on two-hop wireless architectures with an access channel followed by backhaul links. Examples include Cloud-Radio Access Networks (C-RAN) and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems. Furthermore, communication services characterized by the coexistence of heterogeneous requirements are emerging as key use cases. This paper studies the performance of critical service (CS) and non-critical service (NCS) for Internet of Things (IoT) systems sharing a grant-free channel consisting of radio access and backhaul segments. On the radio access segment, IoT devices send packets to a set of non-cooperative access points (APs) using slotted ALOHA (SA). The APs then forward correctly received messages to a base station over a shared wireless backhaul segment adopting SA. We study first a simplified erasure channel model, which is well suited for satellite applications. Then, in order to account for terrestrial scenarios, the impact of fading is considered. Among the main conclusions, we show that orthogonal inter-service resource allocation is generally preferred for NCS devices, while non-orthogonal protocols can improve the throughput and packet success rate of CS devices for both terrestrial and satellite scenarios."
9204706,Deep Learning-Based Autoencoder for m-User Wireless Interference Channel Physical Layer Design,"Deep learning (DL) based autoencoder (AE) has been proposed recently as a promising, and potentially disruptive approach to design the physical layer of beyond-5G communication systems. Compared to a traditional communication system with a multiple-block structure, the DL based AE approach provides a new paradigm to physical layer design with a pure data-driven and end-to-end learning based solution. In this article, we address the dynamic interference in a multi-user Gaussian interference channel. We show that standard constellation are not optimal for this context, in particular, for a high interference condition. We propose a novel adaptive DL based AE to overcome this problem. With our approach, dynamic interference can be learned and predicted, which updates the learning processing for the decoder. Compared to other machine learning approaches, our method does not rely on a fixed training function, but is adaptive and applicable to practical systems. In comparison with the conventional system using n-psk or n-QAM modulation schemes with zero force (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer, the proposed adaptive deep learning (ADL) based AE demonstrates a significant achievable BER in the presence of interference, especially in strong and very strong interference scenarios. The proposed approach has laid the foundation of enabling adaptable constellation for 5G and beyond communication systems, where dynamic and heterogeneous network conditions are envisaged."

To satisfy this mission, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been recognized as a promising solution for 5G networks to significantly improve the network capacity. Considered as a booster of IoT devices, and in parallel with the development of NOMA techniques, multi-access edge computing (MEC) is also becoming one of the key emerging technologies for 5G networks. In this paper, with an objective of maximizing the computation rate of an MEC system, we investigate the computation offloading and subcarrier allocation problem in Multi-carrier (MC) NOMA based MEC systems and address it using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Computation Offloading (DRLOCO-MNM) algorithm. In particular, the DRLOCO-MNM helps each of the user equipments (UEs) decides between local and remote computation modes, and also assigns the appropriate subcarrier to the UEs in the case of remote computation mode. The DRLOCO-MNM algorithm is especially advantageous over the other machine learning techniques applied on NOMA because it does not require labeled data for training or a complete definition of the channel environment. The DRLOCO-MNM also does avoid the complexity found in many optimization algorithms used to solve channel allocation in existing NOMA related studies. Numerical simulations and comparison with other algorithms show that our proposed module and its algorithm considerably improve the computation rates of MEC systems."

GFDM, however, requires dedicated step to synchronize time and frequency. Current methods of synchronization for GFDM do not perform well, leading to an increase in the bit error rate. In this paper, we propose a method to synchronize time and frequency of GFDM waveforms in a fading channel, under a situation that the channel gains have already been estimated perfectly. The proposed method inserts a known marker and estimates the time and frequency jointly. We compare the proposed method and existing methods in terms of the root mean square error between an actual time or frequency offset and the estimated one. The results show that the proposed method outperform existing methods over a wide range of the signal to noise ratios (SNRs). Furthermore, the proposed method has a desirable property, that the root mean square error approaches zero with an increase in the SNR. The proposed method can synchronize time and frequency accurately and enhance the use of GFDM as a modulation technique in IoT applications."

In this paper, we adopt Ginibre Determinant Point Process to characterize distribution of machine type communication gateways in a single cellular coverage. Drone-based access point is introduced to establish favorable wireless channel. We then establish a large-scale linear programming problem to find the minimum electric power consumption of the IoT system where ambient radio and on-chip battery are the sole energy sources. Specifically, a hybrid energy harvesting protocol combining millimeter wave and microwave below 6GHz is presented to enhance system sustainability. Two typical energy harvesting modes are proposed, of which the first mode performs better when dealing with long-term Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication service, while the second mode is more suited to occasional short-term energy sharing. When machine type communication device is abundantly charged at the beginning, we further obtain the closed-form expression revealing the ratio relationship between average electric power consumption under both modes, which is explicitly related to: (a) initial battery energy level of machine type network nodes, (b) service-oriented hybrid energy harvest (EH) protocol configuration, (c) system operation time and (4) fundamental electric and battery consumption of the whole system.

9373954,Forward Privacy Preservation in IoT-Enabled Healthcare Systems,"In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled health monitoring wearable devices have become a trend in healthcare systems, regularly collecting vital sign data from patients and uploading them to the cloud. Through on-demand search queries, data are shared with third-party healthcare service providers to monitor patients' health status and provide timely diagnoses. To ensure privacy and security, patient health data should be encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud. The cloud can give search encryption services. However, current searchable encryption (SE) technologies still have problems with forward privacy security and verifiability. This article proposes an IoT-cloud-enabled healthcare data system incorporating a SE method with forward privacy and verifiability. By designing a trapdoor permutation function, we render the resulting output indistinguishable from meaningless random data to the adversary. Thus, the adversary cannot judge the relationship between a newly inserted record and a past search token, and therefore, the system realizes forward privacy or forward secrecy. We propose a multikeyword search verification mechanism based on a pseudo-random function. Our approach solves verifying the correctness of search results in the top-k search scenario with partial search results. A formal security analysis proves that our scheme achieves forward privacy preservation, which can help guarantee healthcare data privacy. Additionally, a performance evaluation shows that our method is efficient and effective, providing an information security system to preserve patient privacy in IoT-enabled healthcare systems."

Leveraging the low data rates and long data sending intervals of IoT devices, several of the IoT devices in the same serving area of the core network are grouped together and take turns to send their data to their servers without causing overlaps in their communication. In this paper, we take this approach further and benefiting from the flexibility in data sending schedules, we aim to increase savings in cellular resources by shifting (delaying or performing earlier) the regular traffic patterns of IoT devices slightly. To this end, we consider two different traffic shifting models, namely, consistent and inconsistent shifting. We first solve the optimal aggregation of IoT devices under each model by using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). In order to avoid the high complexity of ILP solution, we then develop a heuristic based solution that runs in polynomial time. Through simulations, we show that heuristic based solution provides close to optimal results in various scenarios and shifting based aggregated communication offers more resource optimization (i.e., smaller number of bearers needed to connect all IoT devices) than the aggregated communication with no shifting."

In order to address the requirement of massive IoT-type connections, the spectrum has to be better utilized. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is a promising technique that can effectively improve the spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we consider the power allocation problem of a downlink Single Input Single Output (SISO) NOMA system. We aim to maximize the total system throughput, while maintaining a good level of fairness among the users. The system available bandwidth is divided into a number of subbands, and each subband is assigned to two users. The combination of the assigned users is based on the performance of each one, in terms of throughput. Two methods are reported for allocating power to each subband. In the first method, the maximum transmission power is equally divided to all bands, whereas, in the second, we use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to allocate the power to each band aiming to maximize the total system throughput. The power allocated to each band is further divided into the two multiplexed users. A series of extensive simulations and comparisons were employed to evaluate our proposed power allocation methods. The results indicate that our methods provide a significant improvement over the compared ones, both in terms of achieved system throughput and fairness among the users."

The thresholds’ values are tuned according to the ""behaviour"" of the statistical features in the considered environment. This method is compared to a sample-based (whose aim is to detect the data distribution) and a machine learning-based approaches. Although our approach is general, we present experimental results for IEEE 802.11 indoor channels.

8903766,Context-Aware K8S Scheduler for Real Time Distributed 5G Edge Computing Applications,"The problem of service availability assurance and optimal performance in 5G edge computing is solved by means of static or rudimentary dynamic scheduling techniques. In the cases where Kubernetes orchestration is used, the default scheduler manages the allocation of services with methods designed to suit general cloud application requirements, not specific to the requirements of edge computing (i.e. evaluating basic usage devices parameters). This design has its shortcomings, especially due to its slow reactions to the environmental changes. In such circumstances, it would be preferred to take the physical, operational and network parameters into consideration along with the software states and orchestrate the applications dynamically. We propose an improved design that integrates real-time information about the edge devices in the scheduler decision algorithm enabling advanced orchestration and management along with improved fault tolerance capabilities of the network edge. We validate the utility of the design by comparing it to the default Kubernetes scheduler."
9217261,Secure and Reliable IoT Communications Using Nonorthogonal Signals’ Superposition with Dual-Transmission,"Ensuring secure communication for internet of things (IoT) has drawn much attention because of the limitation in the use of conventional cryptographic techniques owing to the unique features of IoT devices such as low complexity, lightweight computing, and power constraints. Physical layer security (PLS) has the potential to provide security solutions that are suitable for such applications. In this article, an efficient PLS approach is proposed for providing secure communication against external and internal eavesdroppers in a downlink multi-carrier IoT communication system. The system consists of a transmitter with a single active antenna (and a single radio frequency chain) that is trying to communicate with two single-antenna IoT devices in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. In the proposed algorithm, frequency selective channel based pre-coder matrices and dual-transmission approach are jointly employed to provide simple and secure communication without complex computational processing at the IoT devices. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm can provide security against internal and external eavesdroppers and is suitable for IoT devices."

To mitigate such threat, there is an utmost need for effective IoT malware classification and family attribution, which provide essential steps towards initiating attack mitigation/prevention countermeasures. In this paper, motivated by the lack of sophisticated malware obfuscation in the implementation of IoT malware, we utilize features extracted from strings- and image-based representations of the executable binaries to propose a novel multi-dimensional classification approach using Deep Learning (DL) architectures. To this end, we analyze more than 70,000 recently detected IoT malware samples. Our in-depth experiments with four prominent IoT malware families highlight the significant accuracy of the approach (99.78%), which outperforms conventional single-level classifiers. Additionally, we utilize our IoT-tailored approach for labeling newly detected “unknown” malware samples, which were mainly attributed to a few predominant families.

Physical layer can always be a fast and reliable medium for exploitation while having legit communication as a source for performance and latency optimization besides the enhanced spectrum efficiency depicted by multicasting and its adequate worth. Utilization of CAVs as connected IoT resources for load mitigation is also eminent from research. In this article, we benefit the 5G V2X environment of CAVs for road safety use case where a secure geo-specific locally containerized co-operative aware autonomous driving system would be the prime concern. In the localized V2X server, Roadside units(RSUs) get benefit from physical layer parameters to generate a key for end to end(E2E) communication while the On Board Unit(OBU) containers provide the cryptographic shreds as microservices in real-time as they do while monitoring or location updating. Mininet and RYU as network emulator and controller are used for the scenario implementation and analysis. Beyond RSU, no need of secure communication exists any longer due to the broadcast nature of messages for all involved vehicles in the marked premises so instead of security, we put prime focus on least latency due to highly dynamic environment and we did zero forced sparse channel estimation for evolved multimedia broadcast multicast service(eMBMS) in C-V2X."

Therefore, this paper presents a novel compact antenna design for UHF RFID handset with angle-adjustable linear polarization using characteristic mode analysis. The proposed antenna design consists of a multi-orientation dipole partially printed on three sides of C shaped F4B substrate and an internal ground behind the handset screen. First of all, different characteristic modes of multi-orientation dipole and ground plane are analyzed using characteristic mode analysis, which shows that the vertical polarization is provided by ground plane, and the horizontal polarization is produced by the dipole. Secondly, the proposed multi-orientation dipole is connected with internal ground using two metal shorting strips to adjust the polarization angle. Finally, a suitable feeding position is selected to excite the required characteristic modes to get the radiation pattern with slant polarization. This antenna covers whole US UHF RFID band ranging from 902 - 928 MHz. The advantage behind slant polarization lies in reading of RFID tags with both horizontal and vertical orientations. A prototype of antenna with 45-degree linear polarization angle is fabricated to prove the concept, and the measurement results are matched well with simulated results.

However, even though there are advantages to MEC, we face many significant problems, such as how a service provider (SP) deploys requested services efficiently on a destination MEC node, and how to discover existing services in neighboring MEC nodes to save edge resources. In this paper, we present a decentralized and revised content-centric networking (CCN)-based MEC service deployment/discovery protocol and platform. We organized a gateway in every area according to a three-tiered hierarchical MEC network topology to reduce computing overhead at the centralized controller. We revised CCN to introduce a protocol to help SP deploy their service on MEC node and assist MEC node discover services in neighboring nodes. By using our proposed protocol, MEC nodes can deploy or discover the requested service instances in the proximity of IoT devices to reduce transmission delay. We also present a mathematical model to calculate the round trip time to guarantee quality of service. Numerical experiments measure the performance of our proposed method with various mobile IoT device services. The results show that the proposed service deployment protocol and platform reduce the average service delay by up to 50% compared to legacy cloud.

Most of these new applications depend on deep learning algorithms, which have made great advances in many areas of artificial intelligence (AI). However, researchers have found that AI algorithms based on deep learning pose numerous security problems. For example, deep learning is susceptible to a well-designed input sample formed by adding small perturbations to the original sample. This well-designed input with small perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans, is called an adversarial example. An adversarial example is similar to a truth example, but it can render the deep learning model invalid. In this article, we generate adversarial examples for spatiotemporal data. Based on the travel time estimation (TTE) task, we use two methods-white-box and blackbox attacks-to invalidate deep learning models. Experiment results show that the adversarial examples successfully attack the deep learning model and thus that AI security is a big challenge of 5G."

As an important tool for edge computing-oriented perceptual access implementation, edge IoT agents can not only have gateway functions such as protocol conversion and data collection, but also carry applications including edge-side data storage and stream data processing, intelligent reasoning decision-making, etc. service. Traditional edge IoT agents mostly use heavyweight virtual machines as the implementation technology, and the applications provided are tightly coupled, and they cannot achieve mutual isolation and independent deployment between applications. Therefore, this paper uses lightweight virtualized Docker container technology to deploy services and build an edge IoT agent platform based on Docker containers. At the same time, facing real-time changing access requirements, edge IoT agent clusters may have the problem of limited container load. We propose a dynamic container scheduling method to improve the access carrying capacity of container clusters and ensure the high availability of edge IoT agents."
9233467,An Efficient and Lightweight Predictive Channel Assignment Scheme for Multiband B5G-Enabled Massive IoT: A Deep Learning Approach,"Multihop device-to-device (D2D)-enabled relay networks are envisaged to be utilized by the Internet of Things (IoT) and massive machine-type communication (mMTC) traffic for the purpose of offloading data in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks. The emerging challenge of spectrum scarcity and overloading of cellular base stations can be addressed using such relay nodes in terms of spectrum and energy efficiency. In order to improve spectral efficiency, in this article, we intend to employ several frequency bands concurrently in the relay node rather than the traditional concept of specifying one channel on a specific band at a time. A deep learning-based predictive channel selection method is leveraged to unravel the potential challenges associated with the dynamic channel conditions in the multiband relay networks. For predicting the most appropriate channel based on its quality, signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) is adopted as the metric, which is predicted by the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The best modulation and coding rates of the predicted band are attained in order to transmit the packets received from the source or previous relay node to the successive relay node/destination. Two proactive channel assignment strategies, referred to as controlled and smart prediction schemes, are employed to exhibit the performance of the shallow and deep-CNN models. The proposed model is evaluated on multiple publicly available data sets from diverse network systems and compared with several machine/deep learning methods. Our proposal leads to encouraging results for proactively predicting the conditions of the channels and choosing the most suitable ones in multiband relay systems."

End-to-end network slicing is a key-feature of 5G since it allows to share and at the same time isolate resources between several different use cases as well as between tenants by providing logical network. The virtual separation of the network slices on a common end-to-end mobile network infrastructure enables an efficient usage of the underlying network resources and provides means for security and safety related isolation of the defined logical networks. A much-discussed challenge is the reuse or overbooking of resources guaranteed by contract. However, there is a consensus that over-provisioning of mobile communication bands is economically infeasible and a certain risk of network overload is acceptable for the majority of the 5G use cases. In this paper, an efficient model for mobile network slice embedding is presented which enables an informed decision on network slice admission. This is based on the guaranteed end-to-end mobile network resources that have to be provided on the one hand and the capacities and capabilities of the underlying network infrastructure on the other hand. The network slice embedding problem is solved in form of a Mixed Integer Linear Program with an uncertainty-aware objective function. Subsequently, the confidence in the availability of each resource is analyzed."
9129542,Maximizing Connection Density in NB-IoT Networks with NOMA,"We address the issue of maximizing the number of connected devices in a Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) network using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The scheduling assignment is done on a per-transmit time interval (TTI) basis and focuses on efficient device clustering. We formulate the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and solve it under interference, rate and sub-carrier availability constraints. We first present the bottom-up power filling algorithm (BU), which solves the problem given that each device can only be allocated contiguous sub-carriers. Then, we propose the item clustering heuristic (IC) which tackles the more general problem of non-contiguous allocation. The novelty of our optimization framework is two-fold. First, it allows any number of devices to be multiplexed per sub-carrier, which is based on the successive interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities of the network. Secondly, whereas most existing works only consider contiguous sub-carrier allocation, we also study the performance of allocating non-contiguous sub-carriers to each device. We show through extensive simulations that non-contiguous allocation through IC scheme can outperform BU and other existing contiguous allocation methods."
8902668,Multi-Channel Access Solutions for 5G New Radio,"Multi-channel access is a family of multi-service radio resource management solutions that enable a user equipment to aggregate radio resources from multiple sources. The objective is multi-fold: throughput enhancement through access to a larger bandwidth tailored for enhanced mobile broadband, reliability improvement by increasing the diversity order and/or coordinated transmission/reception tailored for ultra-reliable low latency communication service classes, as well as flexibility and load balancing improvement by decoupling the downlink and the uplink access points, for both service classes. This paper presents several multi-channel access solutions for 5G New Radio multi-service scenarios. In particular, throughput enhancement and latency reduction concepts like multi-connectivity, carrier aggregation, downlink-uplink decoupled access and coordinated multi-point connectivity are discussed. Moreover, novel design solutions exploiting these concepts are proposed. Numerical evaluation of the introduced solutions indicates significant performance gains over state-of-the-art schemes; for example, our proposed component carrier selection mechanism leads to a median throughput gain of up to 100% by means of an implicit load balance. Therefore, the proposed multi-channel access solutions have the potential to be key multi-service enablers for 5G New Radio."

9097306,Grant-Free Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for IoT: A Survey,"Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) is one of the main three focus areas in the 5th generation (5G) of wireless communications technologies to enable connectivity of a massive number of Internet of things (IoT) devices with little or no human intervention. In conventional human-type communications (HTC), due to the limited number of available channel resources and orthogonal resource allocation techniques, users get a transmission slot by making scheduling/connection requests. The involved control channel signaling, negligible with respect to the huge transmit data, is not a major issue. However, this may turn into a potential performance bottleneck in mMTC, where huge number of devices transmit short packet data in a sporadic way. To tackle the limited radio resources and massive connectivity challenges, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a promising technology that allows multiple users to simultaneously transmit their data over the same channel resource. This is achieved by employing user-specific signature sequences at the transmitting devices, which are exploited by the receiver for multi-user data detection. Due to its massive connectivity potential, NOMA has also been considered to enable grant-free transmissions especially in mMTC, where devices can transmit their data whenever they need without the scheduling requests. The existing surveys majorly discuss different NOMA schemes, and exploit their potential, in typical grant-based HTC scenarios, where users are connected with the base station, and various system parameters are pre-defined in the scheduling phase. Different from these works, this survey provides a comprehensive review of the recent advances in NOMA from a grant-free connectivity perspective. Various grant-free NOMA schemes are presented, their potential and related practical challenges are highlighted, and possible future directions are thoroughly discussed at the end."

While a number of theoretical models have been developed for the interference statistics in communications for the IoT, there is very little experimental validation. In this letter, we address this key gap in understanding by performing statistical analysis on recent measurements in the unlicensed 863 MHz to 870 MHz band in different regions of Aalborg, Denmark. In particular, we show that the measurement data suggests the distribution of the interference power is heavy tailed, confirming predictions from theoretical models."
9379817,Remote Healthcare Monitoring System for Aging Population Based on IoT and Big Data Analysis,"As the population ages, this will put tremendous pressure on pensions and the medical system. Health insurance for the elderly poses a major challenge to the allocation of limited medical resources. The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely regarded as a potential solution to relieve pressure on healthcare systems. With the rapid development of wireless communication technologies such as backscatter communication, Wi-Fi and 5G, in vivo and in vitro medical devices have been greatly developed. In this article, we propose a real-time big data healthcare analysis system based on the combination of shallow neural networks and deep neural networks. The system consists of two parts: the detection of fog layer abnormality based on shallow neural network and the diagnosis of cloud disease based on deep neural network. The system can not only make full use of the real-time nature of the fog layer but also give full play to its powerful computing power based on reducing the computing pressure of the cloud layer."
9386233,Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Assisted UAV Communications for IoT Networks: Performance Analysis,"The increasing demand for wireless connectivity and the emergence of the notion of the Internet of Everything require new communication paradigms that will ultimately enable a plethora of new applications and new disruptive technologies. In this context, the present contribution investigates the use of the recently introduced intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) concept in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) enabled communications aiming to extend the network coverage and improve the communication reliability as well as spectral efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In particular, we first derive tractable analytic expressions for the achievable symbol error rate (SER), ergodic capacity, and outage probability of the considered set up. Following this, we also derive tight upper and lower bounds on the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our derivations are then compared with the corresponding asymptotic performance, based on the central limit theorem (CLT) assumption, which reveals that the asymptotic SNR falls within the area between derived bounds, and approaches either bound depending on the number of reflective elements (REs). We further show that the asymptotic SER becomes in a tight agreement with the corresponding exact simulation SER for N ≥ 16. In addition, the offered results demonstrate that the use of the IRS is significantly effective as they assist in improving the achievable SER by five orders of magnitude. We further demonstrate that, in terms of achievable ergodic capacity, IRS-assisted UAV communication systems can exhibit ten times higher capacity compared to conventional UAV communications. Based on the above, these results and related insights are anticipated to be useful in the design and deployment of IRS-assisted UAV systems in the context of beyond 5G communications, such as 6G communications."
8733580,The Concept of 2-Layer Routing for Wireless 5G Networks and Beyond,"In this paper, the concept o 2-Layer routing for wireless 5G networks is presented. A new fifth generation of the network along with the platform known as the Internet of Things (IoT) are an upcoming trend not only in the commercial market but also in the research area. The 5G networks and IoT will be part of smart homes, smart cities and every aspect of our lives. They are considered as a promising technology, that interconnects different types of existing networks into one functional network. In this paper, a brief vision of utilization and areas of deployment of 2-Layered network model consisted of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is described along with communication technologies and protocols needed for the functionality of 2-Layered model. Presented simulations prove that interconnection of MANET network with WSN network provides faster data delivery and higher data rates than traditional WSN network since MANET nodes are able to carry data load from WSN sensors. Therefore, utilization of presented 2-Layered model will be useful in disaster scenarios or data harvesting, when urgent data needs to be delivered quickly."
8911636,Big data-empowered system for automatic trouble ticket generation in IoT networks,"One of the major concerns for a mobile network operator is the customer trouble ticket (TT) management, as it is directly related to the customers' satisfaction about the provided quality of service. This issue becomes specially relevant when the number of end devices being served by the cellular network increases dramatically. Such is the case of communications under the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. In this case, a traditional approach for TT management appears as insufficient and novel mechanisms for TT management need to be devised. This work proposes a big data-empowered framework for automatic TT generation, showing its capability to deal with such amount of data. Results in a live network providing IoT communication show that the proposed framework was able to identify the network anomalies that were identified following a traditional approach as well as many others that remained hidden under that approach."
9114998,Self-Calibrated Edge Computation for Unmodeled Time-Sensitive IoT Offloading Traffic,"With the characterizing benefits of ultra-low latency, contextual computing, and mobile scalability, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as a key enabler for realizing a tremendous boom in heterogeneously time-sensitive Internet-of-Things (IoT) services in the fifth-generation (5G) ecosystems. However, achieving low-latency comes at a cost of energy-efficiency reduction. To address and balance this tradeoff, this paper proposes a joint optimization of energy consumption and latency satisfaction in MEC servers, called latency-aware green (LAG) computing algorithm. To fully consider the heterogeneity of IoT services offloaded to the MEC servers, offloading traffic at the MEC servers is assumed to be unmodeled and unpredictable. Using the proposed LAG algorithm, each MEC server autonomously and dynamically calibrates its own computing frequency based on the current status of the workload buffer size and computational workload arrival rate. This dynamic calibration provides minimum energy consumption for the workload computation while maintaining the computational latency stabilized under a desired threshold. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm maintains stable MEC servers in an energy-efficient manner."
9685392,5G Massive Machine Type Communication Performance in Non-Terrestrial Networks with LEO Satellites,"An Internet of Things (IoT) non-terrestrial network (NTN) refers to an IoT network that utilizes airborne or spaceborne payload for communication. Using NTNs to serve IoT devices has the potential of further expanding the use cases as well as coverage for IoT. This has motivated the work in 3GPP on evolving Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Long Term Evolution for machine type communications (LTE-M) wireless access technologies to support NTN. While the topic of IoT over NTN has attracted much attention, the performance of IoT NTN has not been well studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of IoT low Earth orbit (LEO) NTN utilizing LTE-M by evaluating the connection density. The evaluation results show that for a LEO satellite at 600 and 1200 km altitude, LTE-M can support 364 and 78 users per km 2 for a single narrowband in its coverage area, respectively. This implies that an LTE-M based LEO NTN can potentially serve IoT in remote areas, thereby complementing the coverage of terrestrial networks."
9417484,Light-based Internet of Things: Implementation of an Optically Connected Energy-autonomous Node,"In the near future, with the development of 5G NR, a massive number of IoT nodes are expected to come online. Acquiring bandwidth from an overcrowded licensed radio frequency spectrum as well as overcoming battery life constraints will become the main challenges for these IoT based devices. As a promising solution for the above challenges, this work provides a feasibility study and an implementation framework for a visible light communication-based energy-autonomous IoT node. This work proposes the use of printed electronic technology to minimize the physical characteristics and cost of the IoT node. In the future, energy-autonomous IoT nodes could be available virtually on any surface. Whenever the node is exposed to light, it will be connected to internet."
9144523,NPDCCH Period Adaptation and Downlink Scheduling for NB-IoT Networks,"The third-generation partnership project (3GPP) has defined a new radio access network protocol, called the narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT). To accommodate devices with diverse signal qualities, the base station can flexibly adjust the lengths of the two important radio resources, the narrowband physical downlink control channel (NPDCCH) and narrowband physical downlink-shared channel (NPDSCH), to serve the devices under one coverage enhancement level. The interval between two consecutive NPDCCH is called an NPDCCH period. Given the NPDCCH period, the base station should allocate the two radio resources for the devices to receive downlink data. The NPDCCH period length and resource allocation significantly affect the radio resource utilization of NB-IoT networks. In this article, we investigate the NPDCCH period adaptation and the NB-IoT scheduling problem over NB-IoT networks. The objective is to minimize the consumed radio resource. We prove that the scheduling problem is NP-hard and cannot be approximated with a ratio better than 3/2. Then, we propose two algorithms based on our observations to solve the target problems and show that the proposed scheduling algorithm is a 2-approximation algorithm. The simulation results evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and provide useful insights into the NPDCCH period adaptation and scheduling design for NB-IoT networks."
9634013,Cooperated Traffic Shaping With Traffic Estimation and Path Reallocation to Mitigate Microbursts in IoT Backhaul Network,"An aggregating switch (SW) network offers cost-effective accommodation to Internet-of-Things (IoT) traffic by aggregating the traffic. In such a network, it is crucial to eliminate the discarded traffic caused by the simultaneous transmission of massive IoT devices, namely microburst. Traffic shaping is a technique of storing traffic in one SW to mitigate microbursts. Conventional traffic shaping is limited because only one SW performs shaping with a limited queue length. Thus, we propose cooperated traffic shaping using multiple SWs to accommodate more traffic. We formulated equations to derive the minimum queue length with shaping rates which gradually decrease in geometric progression. To acquire the queue length using general SWs without short-cycle monitoring, we propose a scheme for estimating the instantaneous input rate and data size of microburst traffic required for our equations. If the calculated queue length cannot be prepared in the current path, we propose reallocating the path to another one with more SWs. We experimentally demonstrated the proposed coordinated traffic shaping technique by implementing it in commercial SWs with 125 emulated IoT devices. The results showed that the difference between the experimental and numerical results was below 4.2%, and the queue length can be reduced by 40% when there are three SWs. In addition, a path with two SWs was successfully reallocated to one with three SWs."
9647586,Improving the flexibility of 5G heterogeneous networks by slicing,"5G and beyond-5G networks need to support all the traffic pressure by extensive Internet of Things networks. In this document, we review how to improve the flexibility of 5G networks by conducting slicing. We describe the four main pillars for this transition: mass adoption of Software Defined Networking, collocation of aggregators at Multi-access Edge Computing platforms, virtualization of infrastructure and removal of Application Functions through distributed responsibilities over the network. We will present an overview of the efforts being conducted for each of these points and the vision for beyond-5G networks."
